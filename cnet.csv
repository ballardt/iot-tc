This creepy floating eyeball might be the smart home cam you want|"

If you think smart home tech is creepy, the Moon will be a great device to prove your point. It's a floating eyeball-shaped security cam that can rotate to follow your movements. If you think smart home tech is exciting and inventive, well, the Moon might help you prove that point as well.

According to its description, the Moon is a levitating smart home camera that doubles as a smart home hub from Delaware-based startup 1-Ring. Because the base charges the cam wirelessly while it floats, it can supposedly levitate in perpetuity. From the app, you can rotate the cam to look around the room. It also has motion sensing and microphones on either side of the lens, so it knows what direction a sound is coming from, and can turn silently (since it floats) to track the noise.

The company's Indiegogo campaign (currently more than 200 percent funded) says you can customize what the camera does when it senses something -- you can receive a notification, record a video clip or snap a photo. The Moon stores footage locally on a microSD card or uploads it to your cloud drive of choice -- whether that's your personal Dropbox account, Google Drive or your own FTP server.

While the Moon sounds cool as a security camera -- yes, the floating aspect is neat, and I particularly like that you can save footage on your cloud service of choice -- it checks a lot of other boxes as a multipurpose smart tool. It'll work as a hub with built-in Wi-Fi (as you'd expect) as well as Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth, NFC and even an IR blaster.

The Moon will launch with a few impressive smart home partners, including Philips Hue, SmartThings and Honeywell. In theory, you'll be able to connect smaller smart home gadgets such as your light bulbs and switches to the Moon, and then control them with the Moon app.

1-Ring hasn't specified which SmartThings and Philips Hue devices its product works with, or what types of devices it's compatible with. Hopefully, you'll be able to use the Moon in place of a SmartThings or Philips hub, and we've reached out to 1-Ring to confirm these details.

The Moon will also work with all three major voice assistants -- Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Plus, the IR blaster will supposedly let the Moon control your TV and speakers as well.

1-Ring says it also put temp, humidity and carbon dioxide sensors in the Moon, and you can customize notifications based on those readings. It has a built-in speaker, so you can use it for video calls. Plus, the microphones built into the cam will supposedly recognize the difference between talking, crying and glass breaking. The cam's specs also look impressive:

Assuming the Moon comes to fruition, it has a nice combination of features to keep up with our favorite smart home cams. You can preorder the floating cam now via the company's Indiegogo campaign. There's a discount for preordering, and 1-Ring says it will ship the cam anywhere in the world. At retail, the Moon costs $330 -- an expensive price for a smart home cam, but a reasonable one for a celestial body. That price converts to roughly £250 and AU$430.

Feit Electric 6.5W Vintage Style LED review:|"

Nostalgia is big business these days, and even your light bulbs want in. Enter a growing crop of ""vintage"" LEDs with fake filaments meant to mimic the old-school look of yesteryear's incandescents. Distinctive yet efficient, these classic-looking bulbs want to bring early 20th century lighting into the early 21st century.

Feit has been especially aggressive here, with a wide assortment of vintage-style LED bulbs eating up a good-size chunk of the lighting aisle at Home Depot. The newest among them offer improved designs with filaments twisted into spirals, helices and other artistic patterns meant to dial up the nostalgia. And, sure enough, they look pretty darned good.

None of them are as bright as a standard, household bulb should be, but that's sort of the point here. The idea isn't to hide them under a lampshade for practical lighting, but to show them off in exposed bulb setups. You want to be able to look at them and appreciate them without squinting.

For setups like that, they're some of the best-looking bulbs you can buy, and with prices ranging from $8 to $12 each, they aren't unreasonably expensive. That, coupled with relatively strong dimming performance and the efficiency you'd expect from LEDs, makes them an easy recommendation.

First things first, let's talk specs, starting with the centerpiece of Feit's vintage-styled lineup, an $11 elongated 6.5W LED that claims a light output of 250 lumens. I clocked it well above that figure in CNET's lighting lab, with a final reading of 326 lumens -- less than you'd expect from the sort of 40W bulb you might use in an accent lamp, but still bright enough to serve as a functional decoration.

I tested a few of Feit's other vintage-style bulbs, too, and all of them came in over spec. A classic, A-shaped LED that costs $10 and claims a light output of 125 lumens actually measured in at 147 lumens. Similarly, an $8 candelabra LED with a stated light output of 125 lumens actually came in at 152 lumens.

Still, none of those are as bright as more traditional-looking bulbs, and they're not as bright as competing vintage-style bulbs, either. For instance, GE offers an elongated glass LED with a fake filament -- it doesn't look quite as distinctive as the Feit bulb, but it puts out 447 lumens, enough to call itself a legitimate 40W replacement. An A-shaped vintage-style LED from Philips does even better, putting out 855 lumens. That bulb comes in a $12 two-pack, making it a much better value than the $10 A-shaped Feit LED.

Like those competitors, the Feit LEDs each create the appearance of an old-school tungsten filament inside the bulb by arranging the light-emitting diodes into tiny strips. That Feit thought to bend those strips into more artistic designs seems a little obvious in hindsight -- I'll bet that Philips, GE and others are wishing they'd thought of it first. I also appreciated that each of Feit's bulbs did a surprisingly good job of casting light out evenly in all directions, without too much shadowy ""texture"" to the light (a problem I saw with both the GE and the Philips bulbs).

The color temperature is another important part of the nostalgic design. No problems here, as Feit gave each bulb a nice, low, orangey glow of 2,150 K (the A-shaped bulb I tested uses yellow-tinted glass, and claims an even lower color temperature of 2,000 K). I measured all of them within 20 degrees Kelvin of their target temperatures, which is an excellent and accurate result.

I also made sure to take a good look at the dimming capabilities of each bulb. Like the old-fashioned incandescents they imitate, vintage-style LEDs like these look great when you dim them down low. That makes dimming a key performance metric -- and, all in all, Feit's bulbs did a great job.

Each of the three I tested was able to dim smoothly down to total darkness on every dimmer switch I tested, which is very good. The elongated LED only emitted about 70 percent of its total light output at the max setting on two of the newer, slider-style dimmer switches I tested, but I can forgive that since it's about 30 percent brighter than advertised to begin with, anyway.

I did notice a slow and very slight flicker from all three bulbs at low settings, though. It wouldn't be enough to annoy me, but it was enough to be noticeable, and enough to keep me from saying that they aced the test.

These bulbs aren't bright enough to merit a spot beneath your bedside reading lamp's lampshade, but that's not what they're intended for. For exposed bulb setups where the aesthetic is more important than the light output, they'll do the trick, and they'll perform well on dimmer switches, too.

At $11, the price of that elongated LED is a little high, but not unreasonably so -- and if you're choosing it over an actual incandescent, you'll earn a lot of that money back in energy savings over the long run (at three hours of use per day, it'll add just 78 cents to your yearly energy bill, and it's rated to last well over a decade). As a decorative, artsy accent bulb, I think it's a pretty good-looking pick."
Kwikset Obsidian Keywayless Smart Lock review:|"

With so many smart locks elbowing for the spotlight, Kwikset keeps it simple with its newest touchscreen deadbolt, the Obsidian. No keys, no Bluetooth, just a touchscreen keypad and a deadbolt. At $180, Kwikset's standalone version of this lock is a minimalistic and stylish approach to keyless entry.

Named for the volcanic rock it channels in the black shine of the keypad, the Obsidian comes in two versions. The $180 standalone version is a touchscreen deadbolt and nothing more. A $229 Home Connect version will include Z-Wave Plus, a certification for the latest Z-Wave 500 series platform. with extended wireless range, over-the-air firmware updates and wireless encryption. We tested the standalone version at the CNET Smart Apartment.

The touchscreen keypad is the centerpiece here, and it looks very similar to the keypad on the Kwikset Premis ($161.10 at Amazon.com) model we tested last year. Like most smart locks, the Obsidian is powered by four AA batteries that sit in the top of the lock. Audio and LED light alerts notify you of low batteries at three low battery levels, but should your batteries die, there are 9V jumpstart nodes on the bottom of the lock.

Installation was simple. I measured two different dimensions of my door to be sure I was using the correct screws and to determine if I needed an adapter plate. Kwikset includes detailed instructions on how to measure and plenty of hardware options. Once you've attached both sides of the lock to the door, the Obsidian automatically calibrates itself and you're ready to set a code.

The Obsidian accepts up to 16 user codes. Each code must be between four and eight digits. You can also enable a mastercode to approve additional codes or remove them. To add a user code, push the programming button under the lock's interior cover, press the checkmark symbol on the keypad and enter a four- to eight-digit code followed by the lock symbol. The Obsidian's upcoming Home Connect version supports 30 user codes.

Locking and unlocking it with the keypad is pretty intuitive. To lock the door, press the lock button on the bottom right corner of the keypad. To unlock, activate the keypad by touching it and enter your code.

Kwikset's automatic relock feature locks the door 30 seconds after it's unlocked. This worked every time for me. The SecureScreen function also worked well. When entering your code, Obsidian will prompt you with two decoy digits. Press those, followed by your code. SecureScreen defends against would-be intruders inspecting fingerprints, and I'm a fan of it, especially given the shiny touchpad is prone to fingerprint trails.

An LED on the interior side of the lock lets you know if the deadbolt is locked or unlocked. Every 6 seconds, the LED will flash amber for locked and green for unlocked. You can turn this feature off, as you can with SecureScreen, audio and automatic relock. It's a bit annoying to access these switches. A small board of tiny switches under the interior side cover control each of these features. You'll need to unscrew three screws on the faceplate to get to it. If you want to disable automatic relocking to leave your door open for a party or special circumstance, you'll need to find a screwdriver.

With the Z-Wave Plus version coming later this year, you'll be able to control the lock using smart home platforms and security apps. The Obsidian won't have its own app like the Kevo did, but integration with third-party smart home platforms and security apps aims to make up for that. You'll still be able to connect the lock to your home automation platforms and incorporate it into routines. The Obsidian also doesn't offer Bluetooth connection, so there won't be any keyfobs or walking up to your door to unlock it with a phone, like we saw in the Kevo.

Overall, the Obsidian is just what you would expect from a touchscreen deadbolt. It's responsive, comes with added convenience and security features like SecureScreen, automatic relocking and up to 16 user codes. It's also simple. There's no Bluetooth key or remote access with the standalone version. It's just a deadbolt. There's also no physical key at all, for that matter. No key means no fumbling for things in your pocket or purse. If you like the comfort of a physical key, however, or you're looking for Bluetooth capability, Kwikset's Premis or Kevo might be more your style.

Are we ready for keyless entry? Personally, I've always liked the look and functionality of keypads. If you're anything like me, you'll appreciate the elegance and responsiveness of Kwikset's latest lock. If the Home Connect, Z-Wave Plus-equipped version is as true to form as the standalone lock, Obsidian will be tough to beat for a smart keypad deadbolt."
Honeywell's robust DIY security system has potential|"

Honeywell teased an upcoming security system in mid-October. The thermostat giant Wednesday shared more details about its US-only Smart Home Security System. Available starting Wednesday through Indiegogo, the do-it-yourself kit will make its way to retail in early 2018.

Here's the gist. The Smart Home Security System is a scalable (and largely indoor) DIY home security system. The Camera Base Station acts as the system's central hub. It's outfitted with 1080p high-definition livestreaming, a 145-degree viewing angle and free 24-hour cloud storage (this will jump up to three days during a future update).

The system also comes with a variety of optional accessories, including door and window sensors, key fobs, motion sensors and indoor or outdoor MotionViewers -- cameras with integrated motion sensors.

Here's a list of the products available with the system and their retail prices:

Starter Kit (Camera Base Station, 2 Access Sensors, Key Fob) -- $500Camera Base Station -- $400Door and Window Access Sensors -- $40Key Fob -- $30Motion Sensor -- $50Indoor MotionViewer -- $80Outdoor MotionViewer -- $170

Note: Honeywell says Indiegogo backers will get a discount through Dec. 16, but haven't yet shared how much.

Honeywell is just one of a number of companies introducing DIY home security systems. Nest, Ring, Wink and SmartThings have all announced new systems within the last two months. At $500, Honeywell's Starter Kit is priced to compete with the $499 Nest Secure alarm system and the $550 SmartThings Starter Kit. Both the Ring and the Wink starter kits cost $199.

In addition to offering a bunch of optional accessories, Honeywell's Smart Home Security System will also come with geofencing, scenes and Amazon Alexa voice control built into the Camera Base Station. So, like the Alexa-enabled Ecobee4 Smart Thermostat, Honeywell's camera is an Alexa speaker.

This system will also support facial recognition, thanks to a customizable database of friends, family and other folks who regularly visit your house. Honeywell says ""audio analytics"" are in the works as well, so the system should eventually be able to distinguish between your smoke detector and your dog barking to alert you accordingly.

Friday Smart Lock review:|"

After two years of crowdfunding and development, the Friday Labs Smart Lock is here. This $249 smart lock claims to be the world's smallest retrofit lock, and it's definitely easy on the eyes. I can't recommend you rush out and buy it just yet though, as it's still got some learning to do.

The Friday was designed by Big Ideas, the think tank within architecture's well-known Bjarke Ingels Group. It's clear the priority here was design, and I think it's miles ahead of the competition in that regard. Measuring just 2.7 inches in diameter, it's significantly smaller and less bulky than August's line of retrofit locks.

The lock's metal shell is available in seven metal finishes. With so many color options and a measured compromise between modern and traditional design, this lock will look good almost anywhere. You can easily change the shells by sliding a credit card beneath it to release a clip. Friday Labs has yet to offer individual shells for sale -- you have to buy the whole lock -- but that's something it says is coming very soon.

Installation is simple in theory. The instructions do warn that if the tailpiece is too long, however, you'll need a hacksaw (not included) to shorten it. Be warned: If you go this route, you won't be able to change your mind and put your old thumb latch back on. You'll need a whole new lock system, since you've sawed away at the first one.

The Friday is designed to work with your existing lock, and I found that to be true with a few caveats. I didn't have to do any sawing, and in fact, more than one of our doors had both cylinder and turn knob tailpieces, making the cylinder tailpiece just barely too short to reach the Friday.

I also ran into an issue with my deadbolt's machine screws. The round-headed screws that came with my deadbolt blocked the Friday turning mechanism, preventing it from functioning. Friday Labs says it can provide countersunk screws if you have this issue. I swapped my machine screws out for a flatter pair and had no problems with the rest of installation.

The Friday comes with a large, rechargeable battery and USB-powered charging cradle, instead of the more common four-AA setup. Friday Labs says the lock's battery should last for at least three months and up to nine months, depending on use. August claims up to a year of battery life, and we've seen that to be relatively accurate, so the Friday sounds like a bit of a power hog by its own estimation.

Notifications in the app will let you know when your battery is low. Having a rechargeable battery might save you trips to the store for AAs, but it also means your lock has to be turned by hand while the battery charges, which would take about 1.5 hours.

The Friday Lock also comes with ""over-torque,"" a preventive solution to gear breakage and short-circuiting. Two spring levers sit in the faceplate and detect when it's being twisted against its will while the motor is running. Should this happen, it will mechanically disengage the gearing to protect the lock.

Once your lock is installed, the Friday Labs app guides you through naming the device, setting up multiple users and calibrating the lock by opening and closing the door. The app also includes Friday Assist for locking and unlocking. Toggle these two options and the deadbolt will lock when you close the door, and unlock when you approach it. Friday Labs uses geofencing to enable the unlock assist feature, meaning the app will detect the location of your phone and detect if you're within a certain distance of the lock. Unlock assist worked much better than the lock assist feature in my experience, though both were intermittent at best, which doesn't inspire confidence in that feature.

Here's where it starts to get hairier. As far as HomeKit compatibility, you can use Apple's smart home platform to lock and unlock the Friday lock. You can also incorporate it into multidevice scenes. Remote access for these features, however, works only if you have an iPad ($343.99 at Amazon.com) or Apple TV set up as your HomeKit hub.

Wi-Fi is supported, but not enabled yet, and Android users are out of luck as far as remote access goes. A firmware update is in the works to enable Wi-Fi for better integration with smart home platforms, but there's no word on when exactly that will happen.

Friday's app is where most of the action happens, and it does let you set guests and designate an owner. Guests get unlimited access, however. There's no scheduling or creating temporary Bluetooth keys, although Friday Labs also promises a future firmware update to enable this.

Temporary, recurring and scheduled access is a common feature in most high-end smart locks. We've seen it in Kwikset's eKey and in August locks, among others. It's especially useful for Airbnb owners, people with dog walkers and pretty much anyone who might ever need someone to stop by their house. I'm disappointed that feature isn't currently available with this lock and hoping Friday Labs pushes that update out soon.

I really wanted to love this lock. It looks much better than any retrofit lock we've seen thus far. The hardware is great, but the software just isn't there yet, and Friday Labs knows it. Keep an eye on this lock as firmware updates roll out. That Wi-Fi update is supposed to appear by the holidays, and if this and other shortfalls are addressed, the Friday Lock has real potential. Until then, you're better off with a clunkier, but smarter August Smart Lock Pro ($279.99 at Amazon.com)."
Noon Home launches a smart lighting system|"

Noon Home, Inc., a company founded by executive with histories at Nest, August, Google, Roku and more, launches today. With that launch, Noon Home introduces its first product, the Noon Smart Lighting System. The system is designed to integrate existing light fixtures and bulbs into a layered light experience, and its $400 starter kit includes one room director switch, two extension switches and three wall plates.

Layered light is a type of lighting design that blends each of the lights in a room to improve how the room looks and feels. Noon based its research on studies done by John E. Flynn in the 1970s exploring the way a room's lighting changes a person's perception of the room, in addition to a person's mood. Noon's system identifies your existing lights and creates optimal, layered lighting for that environment.

Noon uses a patented bulb detection technology to identify bulb type by reading electrical currents and using algorithms decide what type of bulb is present. It's compatible with dimmable and non-dimmable bulbs, incandescent, LED, CFL, fluorescent, ELV (electronic low voltage) and MLV (magnetic low voltage) fixtures. The room director switch also communicates with the expansion switches wirelessly via Bluetooth, while the Noon app guides you through setup to tell Noon which fixtures and rooms it's controlling. Once everything is identified, Noon uses the bulb, fixture and room information you've provided to minimize low-level popping, flickering and buzzing.

The kit's room director switch powers the system and controls companion extension switches via wireless Bluetooth technology. Once you install it, the room director switch also becomes the system's touchscreen, OLED control panel.

Noon automatically creates three scenes: Relax, Everyday and Bright. Homeowners can create their own custom scenes and select them at the switch or in the Noon companion app.

The system is designed for DIY installation, but it does involve tinkering with your home's wiring. For that reason, Noon offers professional installation through InstallerNet. Professional install starts at $149 for up to three switches and $20 for each additional switch.

The Noon starter kit itself is expensive at $400. While the system is clearly aimed at open-concept living spaces, should you decide to expand into multiple rooms the costs will add up quickly. The room director switch and extension can be purchased separately for $200 and $100 respectively. Starter kits are available at select Best Buy stores, b8ta and online at NoonHome.com. A handful of Home Depot locations will carry Noon products starting November 15.

At launch, Noon will support voice activation with Amazon Alexa, though it won't integrate with any other smart home platforms. By comparison, Lutron connects with Alexa, Nest, IFTTT, Apple HomeKit and more with its reliable and simple smart-lighting design.

We've seen the touchscreen approach to lighting control before, too, with the ill-fated Wink Relay among others. Noon Home may face a similar uphill battle gaining consumer interest in touchscreen controls. Lutron's Caseta smart lighting kit is by far the product to beat, and we'll see how Noon Home stacks up as we test the system in the near future."
Amazon Echo Plus review:|"

If Alexa taught us anything, it's the importance of good software. In Alexa's case, it's what made the original Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) smart speaker so compelling. On its own, the Echo itself was just your average Bluetooth speaker -- it was Alexa, Amazon's cloud-connected, voice-activated AI assistant, that made the Echo a game-changer.

That brings us to the new Echo Plus. At $150 or £140, it looks just like the original Echo, but the ""plus"" part is that it adds in a radio for Zigbee, a wireless standard used by certain smart home gadgets, including Philips Hue smart bulbs, SmartThings plugs, and connected locks from Kwikset and Yale. Thanks to that Zigbee radio, the Echo Plus can talk directly to those gadgets and tell them what to do. You don't need to plug an extra bridge or hub into your router to translate the Zigbee signals, because the Echo Plus is already fluent. It is the hub.

That, coupled with an incremental uptick in sound quality, makes the Echo Plus a good piece of hardware. The software, however, leaves a lot to be desired with clunky, underdeveloped smart home controls in the Alexa app that don't do as much as they really should. The Echo Plus has other strengths, like an aux-out jack and a new ability to launch multifaceted ""routines"" with a single voice command -- but they're the same strengths that you'll get with the new, second-gen Echo, which costs $50 or £50 less.

With the right app updates the Echo Plus could improve over time, and that's probably what will happen. Until it does, though, I wouldn't build a smart home around it.

The Echo Plus comes in your choice of three colors: black, white or a new silver option. Get it in black or white, and you'll have a very hard time distinguishing it from the original.

The way to tell is in the back -- the Echo Plus added in an aux-out jack, just like the second-gen Echo did. That'll let you connect to external speakers using a 3.5mm cable (you can also connect wirelessly via Bluetooth). That's a nice touch, but if you're just looking for an Alexa device to connect with your high-end speaker setup, you're better off just getting an Echo Dot and saving $100 or £90.

One other note: With the old design making an encore, the Echo Plus is now the only Alexa device currently on sale that offers a volume ring up top. The second-gen Echo ditched that volume ring in favor of the Echo Dot's volume buttons to help get the cost down. I prefer the ring -- it feels classier, and it's easier to use in a dark room.

Speaking of sound quality, the Echo Plus does indeed sound a little bit better than the original Echo, at least to my ear. Both are almost equally as powerful, but I noticed better balance between highs and lows and slightly less distortion at high volumes with the Echo Plus. It's a very subtle difference, and not one that you're likely to notice unless, like me, you spend a good chunk of your day listening for it.

That puts the Echo Plus' sound quality much closer to the Echo than to competitors that put more of an emphasis on pristine audio. Like the Echo, it's perfectly capable of filling a room with good-sounding music, but if you're hoping for a high-fidelity audio experience, you might come away disappointed.

A more noticeable uptick in sound quality would have gone a long way towards helping the Plus live up to its name, but the addition of an aux-out jack renders that point largely moot -- audiophiles probably already have a setup they're happy with, and in most cases, the Echo Plus can pipe music through it.

The addition of a Zigbee radio means that the Echo Plus can connect directly with Zigbee gadgets, of which there are many. The most notable name in that mix is Philips Hue -- with the Echo Plus, you can connect with any of the numerous Hue-branded lamps, light bulbs and light strips available and control them right from the Alexa app, no Hue Bridge necessary. That's a tempting way to try out a single bulb before committing to an entire Philips Hue starter kit.

To that end, Amazon is currently offering a free Hue White LED with every Echo Plus, a $15 value. Nice touch.

Still, there's a glaring problem with that integration with Hue, and that's that the Alexa app can't change the color of color-changing bulbs. Alexa can via voice command, but the app itself only lets you turn lights on and off or adjust their brightness. That obviously isn't ideal -- voice commands are great for quick changes, but sometimes, you're going to want to use an app's color selector to dial in on a specific shade.

You could do so easily using the Philips Hue app -- but the app can't connect with the bulbs unless you've got the Hue Bridge plugged into your router. Kind of undercuts the whole point of having an Echo Plus, doesn't it?

That limitation extends to other Zigbee bulbs with multiple color settings, too. For instance, I was able to pair the Echo Plus with a Tradfri smart bulb from Ikea that offers different color temperature settings ranging from warm white to cool daylight. I could adjust the tint of the light using voice commands, but not using the Alexa app. Alexa, add color control to your to-do list.

Another shortcoming -- the Echo Plus can't really do anything with things like motion detectors, open/closed sensors for doors and windows, leak detectors, sirens and other common Zigbee devices. You can pair them with the Echo Plus and see them in the app, but you can't use the app to automate them alongside your lights, locks, thermostats and other Alexa-friendly devices. For now, they're just dead weight, which undercuts the Echo Plus' smart hub appeal even further.

For all I know, support for devices like these could be an app update away, but Amazon wouldn't speculate on its roadmap when I asked, telling me, ""Alexa is always getting smarter and we aim to make updates based on customer feedback.""

One last note: Zigbee opens up a lot of new possibilities, but it's just one standard. Most smart home hubs are compatible with multiple standards, including both Zigbee and Z-Wave. Amazon could have positioned the Echo Plus a little better by following suit, or even by going one step further and partnering with a proprietary brand such as Lutron or Insteon to offer direct control of those devices, too. Instead, you just get Zigbee. That's good, but not great.

You know how you get excited when a new version of your phone's operating system arrives, complete with all sorts of new features and gimmicks to try out? Take that feeling and stretch it out over several months, with the new features arriving every week or two. That's what it's like owning an Echo device. It's an ever-evolving, voice-activated operating system.

The latest addition to Alexa's bag of tricks is a feature called routines. The idea is simple -- you pick your own custom Alexa command, then you pick what you want to have happen whenever you say it. A single routine can trigger multiple things at once -- for instance, saying, ""Alexa, goodnight,"" could turn your lights off, lock your doors and fire up a bedroom space heater.

There's room for creativity here. For instance, you could say, ""Alexa, wake up the kid,"" to trigger a routine that would turn their bedroom lights on and start playing the morning's flash briefing from the Echo Dot on their nightstand. Nothing like a little NPR to nudge Junior out of bed.

The truly sadistic among us might prefer to wake a sleepy teenager by blasting out, say, Chumbawumba, or perhaps a rousing rendition of ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" Unfortunately (or fortunately, in Junior's case), triggering songs and playlists isn't an option with routines. I'd love to see Amazon change that and start allowing users to bring music playback -- still one of Alexa's core features -- into the fold. Heck, it could even be an exclusive feature for Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers. That'd be enough to get me to switch over from Spotify (and if nothing else, it could make for some entertaining new Alexa commercials).

There are other limitations with routines. For instance, that wake-up routine can turn the lights on, but you can't set it to gradually fade them on like you can with a good, dedicated smart lighting app (Philips Hue, Lifx, Lutron and others can all handle prescheduled fades). And while you can trigger any scenes that you've imported in from apps like those, you can't trigger groups of devices. Instead, you have to trigger each device individually within the routine.

Another big limitation: routines don't currently support smart thermostats such as the Nest or the Ecobee4. Chalk another one up for Alexa's to-do list.

Still, the pros outweigh the cons. The ability to craft your own custom Alexa commands is long overdue; the fact that those commands can trigger multiple things at once only sweetens the deal. And, like the rest of Alexa's features, it's a feature that should improve over time.

Routines aren't specific to the Echo Plus -- you can program them with any Echo device, even the old ones. The same goes for the fact that you can now add each of your Echo devices in with a default group of lights, then control those lights just by saying ""turn the lights on."" Both are nice steps forward for Alexa, but neither is a reason to pick the Echo Plus over any other Echo gadget.

As for the app itself, it got a minor design overhaul just in time for the Echo Plus, with a new layout for your smart home gadgets and new in-app controls for turning everything on and off. Tap a little question mark icon, and you'll also find helpful and specific pairing instructions for all of the compatible Zigbee brands.

The app is a bit bland-looking, and it isn't as neatly organized as other smart home control apps. It lists your devices in alphabetical order, and you can't sort them by room or by date added. It isn't terrible by any stretch, but it's too basic to call itself a comprehensive smart home control app, and too basic to set itself apart from better-developed competitors.

The Echo Plus has plenty of potential. Alexa has already proven to be a capable quarterback for the connected living space -- packing her into a dedicated smart home hub makes plenty of sense.

Still, that hub has to be good. And while it's just as good a smart speaker as the original Echo, if not better, the Echo Plus is actually a pretty mediocre hub. It isn't as fully featured as the competition. It only works with Zigbee. It doesn't do anything with sensors and sirens. The app is poorly organized.

I almost wonder if Amazon would have been better off foregoing the full-sized approach and, instead, making the Echo Plus more like the Echo Dot. After all, the Zigbee radio is the only real reason to buy the Plus over another Echo device -- by packing it into a full-sized speaker at $150 or £140, Amazon is forcing Zigbee enthusiasts to pay for more than they may actually need.

All of that is enough for me to tell you to wait on the Echo Plus. There's plenty of potential, yes, but it just isn't there yet."
Wink gives us yet another DIY security system to choose from|"

Add Wink to the growing list of companies with a DIY home security system. The smart hub maker, acquired in July by Will.i.am's tech company I.am+, just debuted a self-monitored security kit called Lookout. Scheduled for an Oct. 31 release, the $199 US-only Lookout includes two door/window sensors, one motion sensor, one siren and chime and one second-generation Wink hub.

While Lookout's Z-Wave-enabled door/window, motion and siren and chime devices are new for the brand, Wink relies on its existing hub as the bridge to translate everything over Wi-Fi. Note: If you already have a first- or second-gen Wink hub, you can buy Lookout accessories a la carte -- it's $29 per door/window sensor, $39 per motion sensor and $39 per siren and chime.

Wink also plans to update its app with a ""dashboard"" layout for easy access to alerts and security activity. You can add a variety of partner product integrations to the mix as well; here's a list of devices that work with Wink.

So, what separates the Lookout from the DIY systems recently introduced by Nest, SmartThings, Ring and Honeywell? Not much, as far as I can tell -- except its relatively low price.

SmartThings' new security system, announced in early October in partnership with ADT, costs $550. Nest's Secure starter kit will set you back $499. Only Ring's $199 Protect system is comparably priced, but it offers optional professional monitoring. Wink's system will not include monitoring, which could be a deal breaker for some customers.

The $199 Wink Lookout will be available on Amazon, Wink's online store and at Home Depot starting Oct. 31. We hope to test Lookout and its competitors soon for a side-by-side home security showdown. Stay tuned."
Lynky gives Google an Echo Show competitor|"

Google's rumored competitor to the Amazon Echo Show ($229.99 at Amazon.com) hasn't yet come to fruition, so a startup called Lynky is taking it upon itself to fill the gap. The device -- also called Lynky -- combines a 5-inch touchscreen with two far-field microphones for voice commands, and it has the Google Assistant built-in. Like a Google Home combined with a tablet combined with a smart home hub, the Lynky either sits on your desk, or mounts on your wall in place of a light switch.

The Lynky makes its debut on Indiegogo on Tuesday, and you'll supposedly be able to use the device just like Google's smart speaker, the Google Home ($129.00 at Jet.com). The Lynky uses the same digital assistant, simply called Google Assistant. Give a voice command and you can play music, access your calendar, search the web or control your smart home.

Like the Amazon Echo Show, the Lynky combines the functionality of a voice assistant with a touchscreen. The Echo Show offered all of the functionality of the original Echo -- a competitor to Google Home -- thanks to Amazon's assistant Alexa, and allowed you to make video calls. Unlike the Echo Show, the Lynky's screen will focus more on smart home assistance than video calls as the device doesn't have a built-in camera.

Unlike the Google Home, you also can't make voice calls with Lynky, as that's one of the limits Google puts on third-party devices with its Assistant built in. What you can do is use Lynky as your smart home hub, as it comes with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Zigbee built-in.

Smart lightbulbs, smart locks and small smart sensors for your doors and windows frequently don't talk directly to your router, as signaling with Wi-Fi takes a lot of battery. These devices communicate with a specialized frequency such as Zigbee and need a bridge to translate their message to send it to the cloud. The Lynky will act as that bridge for a variety of devices, so you won't need to buy a separate hub for your motion sensors or smart bulbs.

You'll be able to control compatible devices with your voice via the Google Assistant. You'll also be able to control them with the touchscreen and set up scenes to control multiple devices with a single touch.

Supposedly, different Lynky devices can communicate with each other -- so you can set up devices with your bedroom Lynky, and control them from another unit in the kitchen. Alternatively, in a nice extra, you can limit the access of a device -- so a guest room Lynky can be limited to controlling just the guest room smart devices.

Lynky has a list of compatible smart home devices on the company's Indiegogo page. You'll be able to use the Lynky as a hub for devices from these companies, but hopefully you can also control devices from Google's larger list of smart home partners. The Google Assistant has its own smart home setup process through the Google Home app. I'd hope the Lynky can seamlessly integrate with these settings. Lynky is supposedly working on making this sync up possible.

The Lynky will launch with an open platform, so smart home developers will theoretically have an easy time working with it. It'll also work with online-rule maker IFTTT and its numerous smart home partners.

Other than smart home controls, the Lynky looks to be underusing its touchscreen, as it doesn't appear that you can install other apps, watch videos, or generally use the Lynky as a tablet. Given its price, limited touchscreen functionality is understandable if a bit disappointing.

You can preorder the Lynky via its Indiegogo campaign now. The preorder price is a reasonable $100, which roughly converts to £75 or AU$130 for our readers in the UK and Australia. Preorders will start shipping at the beginning of 2018. At retail, the Lynky will still be an affordable $150 (about £110 or AU$200).

As always, please note that CNET's reporting on crowdfunding campaigns is not an endorsement of the project or its creators. Before contributing to any campaign, read the crowdfunding site's policies -- in this case, Indiegogo -- to find out your rights (and refund policies, or the lack thereof) before and after a campaign ends.

Lynky might not have the video-calling features of the Amazon Echo Show, but I still like the idea of a Google Home with a touchscreen, and throwing a smart home hub into that combination is a nice touch."
Guardzilla's 360-degree security camera sees the entire room|"

DIY security camera maker Guardzilla today introduced a new indoor camera that wants to give you a complete view of what's happening in your home.

The Guardzilla 360 captures a continuous panoramic live video feed thanks to its 360-degree camera. That's unique for DIY home security cameras, most of which are either fixed-angle (usually capturing up to a 180-degree field of view) or pan-tilt-zoom-style, which might let you rotate the camera 360 degrees, but you can't view 360 degrees all at once. Instead, the Guardzilla app gives you free rein to pan around an entire room in real time (and in 1,712x1,712-pixel resolution) to see what's going on in day or night vision mode.

Unlike the startup's two existing cameras, which retail for just 100 bucks each, the $230 Guardzilla 360 is a premium all-in-one home security system. The 360 has all of the basics you'd expect from a standalone security device along with its panoramic video -- a motion sensor, free clip-based video storage, a 100-decibel siren, remote arming and disarming and geofencing capabilities.

Guardzilla also claims improved ""full-duplex"" two-way talk with its 360 cam thanks to an integrated microphone and speaker. Full-duplex means both sides can talk at the same time, rather than having to wait for the person on the other end to finish. The camera also works with Amazon and Google voice control speakers, as well as Nest, IFTTT and Samsung's SmartThings.

We haven't seen anything quite like the Guardzilla 360 camera, particularly for just $230. The closest competitor we've tested is the IC Real Tech Allie Home, a $600 360-degree DIY camera that works with a VR headset but offers no real home security benefits.

The Guarzilla 360 is available now in the United States at Target, Best Buy and other major retailers. I'll be testing it out over the next few days, so look for a full review soon. In the meantime, check out the below video of Guardzilla's inaugural product, the $100 indoor Guardzilla cam."
Crazy AI cam called Cherry Home knows you by your skeleton|"

Startup security company Cherry Labs wants its system of cameras with built-in sensors to be the eyes and ears of your smart home. The system, called Cherry Home, uses a separate processor and advanced AI to not only see what's going on, but map the room it's in, recognize the people in the room, tell you what they're doing, and notify you if something goes wrong.

Cherry Labs and Cherry Home officially launch today. The company will ship out its first 100 Cherry Home units in February. Those customers will still technically be beta-testing the product. The next 1,000 units will roll out in May.

We've seen cams with some level of AI before. The Netatmo Welcome ($131.99 at Amazon.com) and the Nest Cam IQ recognize faces. An upcoming cam called Lighthouse can even distinguish actions and notify you if someone is running.

The ambitious Cherry Home smart home system promises capabilities well beyond what any of its competitors can do. That's because Cherry Home won't just use facial recognition to tell who's who. The cam also learns the length of your arms and legs, the clothes you wear, the sound of your voice, the color of your skin and hair, and even the way you walk.

Cherry Home triangulates its position in the room through a variety of sensors and creates a diagram of the space you can see on the app. Thanks to all of the info it tracks, the Cherry Home knows who's in the room, where that person is within the room, and what they're doing.

At launch, Cherry Labs promises that its system will send an alert when a person falls down. The system will also know if someone is screaming, crying or just laughing. Cherry Labs service will include professional monitoring, so if the system senses something wrong, it can call emergency services.

In the future, Cherry Labs wants to offer even more advanced smarts. For example, you could tie it into your smart home so it could automatically turn on your reading light when you open a book. And the coolest innovation is still a work in progress for the team but could be a significant step forward for the actual smarts of the smart home -- Cherry Labs is working with pharmaceutical companies to understand the body language of a person when they're about to have a stroke. The company isn't promising this feature any time soon, but at some point, this smart home cam could recognize when you're in the early stages of a stroke and call 911.

To make all of this happen, Cherry Home's cams pack in a bunch of sensors: It has a binocular camera with a 165-degree field of view and an infrared sensor for night vision. Each cam also includes a motion sensor, an accelerometer, a compass and an altimeter so it knows how high it is off the ground and which way it's facing.

The cams send all of the data they collect to a central processor with the computing power of a high-end PC, according to Cherry Labs. That processor will save and analyze all data locally to increase turnaround time on its responsiveness and for added privacy. The cams and processor talk to each other using a mesh Wi-Fi network. The processor only talks to the cloud when it needs to send you an alert or if you're using an app to watch a live feed from a room.

You'll be able to customize alerts and when you want Cherry Labs to save clips. You'll get a daily summary of the activities it spotted and who it saw. And the processor has a backup battery should the power fail.

The cams are battery powered by coin batteries that last about three months. Fortunately, the processor can recharge those batteries, and houses two extra, so you can swap in those once a quarter.

Because Cherry Labs is promising smarts well beyond what's currently available, I'm skeptical that Cherry Home will ever be a reliable consumer product you can pick up at your local electronics store. Even the more limited facial recognition in cams like the Netatmo Welcome is hit-or-miss.

And as you might have expected, the Cherry Home's price will be prohibitive for curious smart-home shoppers. A starter pack of two sensors and a processor will be $900. A pack with four sensors will cost $1,200. An eight-pack kit is $1,400. (Cherry Home will ship overseas. The US prices convert to approximately £680/AU$1,150 for a two-pack, £900/AU$1,500 for four, and £1,000/AU$1,800 for eight.)

For comparison, a Nest Cam IQ can work on its own without a processor and costs $300. Cherry Labs will also charge $14 per month per sensor for its insights and monitoring (£10/AU$18), or $10 per month per sensor if you sign up for a full year (£8/AU$13). You can still use the cams as cams without this subscription, but you lose almost all of the AI advantages. Nest's AI service, called Nest Aware, starts at $10 per month, but doesn't include monitoring.

I also have privacy concerns about Cherry Home. The cams don't have a physical shutter, so you can't manually keep it from keeping an eye on you short of killing its power.

But Cherry Home's promised features sound possible given all of its sensors and the computing power of a high-end PC. It might also be more reliable than the facial recognition we've seen simply because it's not just relying solely on facial recognition.

Plus, the company is being upfront about what it'll be able to do from the start and what it's hoping for in the future.

Obviously, Cherry Home isn't for you if you're looking for an affordable and simple upgrade to your home's security. If you want to preorder Cherry Home, get ready to live on the cutting edge, for better and for worse. That said, I'm fascinated by Cherry Labs' ambitious goals. If the company can pull off all of its lofty promises, the AI of Cherry Home could act as the brain of a more proactive smart home."
Amazon Echo (2017) review:|"

Three years after the debut of the original, Amazon decided the time was right to refresh its flagship smart speaker, the voice-activated Amazon Echo. Generation two arrives to find a landscape littered with new competitors -- not just the Google Home, but also Apple's upcoming HomePod, the platform-agnostic Sonos One, the Cortana-powered Invoke from Harman Kardon and countless others.

At $100 -- nearly half the cost of the original -- the new Echo seeks to undercut them all. Like its predecessor, it doesn't offer premium audio quality, but it's still strong enough to fill a room with decent sound. And, if you like, you can connect it with your existing audio setup using either Bluetooth or a 3.5mm cable, something you can't do with the original. It looks better than before, too, with an attractive and compact new design and a variety of new, interchangeable ""shells"" to choose from.

To be clear, the new Echo isn't any smarter than the first one -- it does everything the original does, and the original does everything it does, save for connecting with external speakers. That list of capabilities continues to grow, though, thanks to a regular roll-out of skills, software updates and integrations with third-party gadgets and services.

In short, it's the same Alexa speaker that quickly became a dominant smash hit, only now it's cheaper and nicer-looking. And here come the holidays.

The new Amazon Echo is shorter than the original, and it comes in a variety of new ""shells"" that each give it a unique look. By default, you get a grey fabric shell in your choice of shades: sandstone (light), charcoal (dark) or heather (in between). Spend an extra $20, and your Echo can come in a hard-bodied silver shell, or a woodgrain shell in oak or walnut.

For my tastes, the woodgrain shells clash with the black plastic top and blue indicator lights, so I'd probably just stick with fabric. If I changed my mind down the line, I could mix things up and swap that fabric shell out for a different one just as easily as swapping out the case on my phone.

To do so, you just push up through a hole in the bottom of the shell to force the inside of the speaker out -- sort of like a Push Pop. Then, you slide the speaker down into its new shell and twist to lock it in.

With its newly squat stature and interchangeable shells, Amazon's new speaker seems aimed at shoring up the Echo's pitch against Google Home, its chief competitor. The two speakers are now roughly the same size, and you can swap out the base coverings on each of them. Matching it on both fronts makes it tougher for customers to pick Google over Amazon because they prefer the design.

Here's the other interesting note on the second-gen Echo -- it's almost more of a follow-up to the Echo Dot than anything else. Not only does it borrow the Echo Dot's aux out jack and emphasis on compact design, but it also ditches the original Echo's volume ring in favor of volume buttons, just like the Echo Dot did (if you have a strong preference for that volume ring, you can still get it with the $150 Echo Plus).

Don't forget that the original Echo Dot cost $90 before Amazon cut the price to $50 for the follow-up. With its price cut from $180 down to $100, the new Echo is following the exact same formula -- and why wouldn't it? The second-gen Echo Dot is Amazon's best-selling Alexa gadget -- for now, at least.

Compared to the original? To my ear, it sounds about the same -- maybe a bit less tinny.

The important part is that the new Echo hits a sweet spot between affordability and sound quality. Setting aside the portable, battery-powered offshoots and the oddball third-party devices like GE's Alexa lamp, we've seen three tiers emerge in the smart speaker category. The first, which includes the Google Home Mini and the Echo Dot, is made up of pint-sized, low-cost speakers that focus on the smarts and leave sound quality as an after-thought. At the other end of the spectrum, you've got premium-priced smart speakers like the Google Home Max and the Apple HomePod that promise high-fidelity audio above all else.

Like the original, the Echo sits right in the middle, squarely between bad and great. Casual listeners will likely call that good (or good enough, at least). If you're an audiophile, you'll want something richer-sounding, but you also probably already have a setup you're happy with. If that sounds like you, just get an Echo Dot.

The new Echo compares favorably against other speakers that sit in that same middle ground. The main competitor is the Google Home smart speaker, and for my money, the new Echo sounds noticeably more powerful. Competitors from that premium tier like the HomePod, the Google Home Max, the Sonos One and the Invoke from Harman Kardon will all likely offer a noticeable uptick in sound quality -- but all of them also cost at least twice as much as the new Echo.

I also made sure to test out the new Echo's microphones. Amazon tells us that they're better than before, with second-gen far-field technology, better wake word processing and enhanced noise cancellation. I didn't notice much of a difference between the two Echoes when I tested them out. Both struggled as expected to hear me over loud music, and both occasionally needed me to raise my voice when music was playing at more moderate volumes (the same can be said of the Google Home). The new Echo did seem noticeably better at hearing me from a distance in quiet conditions, though.

"" data-image-credit=""Tyler Lizenby/CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""echo-2-product-photos-16"" data-image-filename=""echo-2-product-photos-16.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2017/10/20"" data-image-width=""5120"" data-image-height=""3840"" data-image-do-not-crop=""false"" data-image-do-not-resize=""false"" data-image-watermark=""false"" data-lightbox=""enabled"">

That's another interesting thing about the new Echo: It doesn't feel all that new, at least not as far as features are concerned -- and not when you compare it to more creative Alexa offshoots like the fashion-focused Echo Look selfie camera and the upcoming Echo Spot touchscreen alarm clock.

Those offshoot products reflect Amazon's eagerness to make Alexa relevant to as many people as possible. With the Echo, Amazon just wants to be sure it doesn't ""fix"" what isn't broken. The result is a cosmetic and conservative step forward.

Aside from the aux-out jack, the new Echo doesn't boast any new hardware capabilities, nor is it launching with flashy new software or new, marquee skills. Ask the new Echo and the old Echo the same question and they'll each give you the same answer. To borrow some Apple parlance, think of the new Echo as an ""S"" model: a refinement, for sure, but not a redefining one.

Instead, Amazon points to the past year's worth of big additions, including calling and messaging, smart entertainment controls, voice recognition and the fact that you can synchronize music playback across multiple Echo devices. The point isn't to get existing Echo owners to upgrade, but to sweeten the deal for anyone who hasn't bought in yet.

Amazon did take the occasion to give Alexa a tune-up, with a refreshed app and refined smart-home controls that let you control devices such as lights and locks directly from the Alexa app.

Those controls also let you create ""routines,"" where a single Alexa command can trigger a series of actions in your home. For instance, saying ""Alexa, goodnight"" could lock your smart lock, turn the lights and the TV off, and fire up a bedroom space heater you've plugged into a smart switch.The best part is that you create your own custom Alexa command to trigger the routine. Power users should have a field day with that.

If you'd prefer, you can also schedule your routine to run automatically at a specific time, no Alexa command necessary. More than anything, that feature reflects Amazon's attempts to position the Echo lineup as bonafide smart home hubs -- particularly the $150 Echo Plus, which uses a ZigBee radio to quarterback lights, locks and other smart home gadgets.

Here's another improvement for anyone who owns Alexa-friendly smart lights: You can now add each Echo device to a single, default group of lights. To control those lights, just tell that Echo device to ""turn the lights on.""

Grouping your lights and Echos by room is an easy way to make things a little more intuitive. If you tell the Echo in your kitchen to ""turn the lights on,"" it'll turn the lights on in the kitchen. If you tell the Echo Dot in your bedroom to ""turn the lights off,"" it'll turn the lights off in the bedroom.

That's a good, common-sense step in the right direction, but it isn't specific to the new Echo. Like all of the new software features, it applies to the entire Echo lineup, including the original. That means that there's very little reason to upgrade to the new Echo if you're already happy with the old one.

Keep an eye on this space -- I'll be sure to update it regularly as new features arrive.

It's been fascinating to watch Alexa's story unfold. With good AI and great product strategy, Amazon has managed to do more than any other company to make voice controls meaningful in our homes -- more than even Apple, which introduced us to Siri years before Alexa came around. And, if the three-year drumbeat of new Alexa features and the slew of new Echo devices on the horizon are any indication, that story is far from finished.

With the Amazon Echo, you get to watch that story play out under your roof. Even at three years old, it's a legitimately futuristic product -- a voice-activated computer that turns your home into your very own Star Trek ship. The competition is finally getting interesting, but Amazon is still the one driving the conversation. At its new price of $100, the Echo will be awfully tough to beat.

And who knows -- maybe the Echo is obsolete in five years. Maybe smart speakers are just a fad, or a stepping stone to whatever the next big thing is. Who knows. Who cares? Right now, the Echo is a useful, versatile device that does its job well, and Amazon clearly has some pretty big plans for it. Sometimes in tech, it's just fun to be along for the ride.

Editor's Note: Updated 27 Oct. at 12:30 a.m. ET with impressions of Alexa's new ""Routines"" feature and other recent software improvements. Expect this review to be updated regularly."
Harman Kardon Invoke review:|"

""Hey, Cortana: What can you do for me that Alexa can't?""

That's the opening question you might want to ask the Harman Kardon Invoke ($290.00 at Amazon Marketplace), a smart speaker that's the first non-Windows PC device powered powered by Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant. While Alexa is tops for smart home integration and shopping, and Google Home ($129.00 at Jet.com) is best for answering deeper AI-powered questions, Cortana -- not surprisingly -- finds her strengths with Office-centric tasks such as calendar queries and Skype calls. And thanks to Harman Kardon's audio pedigree, this speaker sounds great with music, too.

The Invoke was announced months ago, but it's finally available on Oct. 22 for $199. There's no timeframe for UK or Australian availability, but that price converts to about £150 or AU$255.

Invoke's design feels high-end, and that's good news for a speaker with a higher price tag than the Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) and Google Home. A metal outer casing comes in Graphite and Pearl/Silver. On the top of the device, a smooth-turning volume control and touchpad act as user interfaces. Like Alexa, a circular light on the top of the device lights up when it hears the wake phrase. In this case, that's ""Hey, Cortana"".

Microsoft's version of Alexa and Siri is available on Windows 10 and as an app on Android and iOS devices. Cortana can do everything you'd expect, including play music, answer questions, make calls and tell you about your day. Microsoft's focus is on bringing professional productivity into the home. With Office 365 and Outlook connected, you can ask Cortana about your calendar or set reminders that will appear across Cortana-enabled devices. I connected my Outlook account and Cortana answered questions about meeting times, places and participants. But if you're not using those services, that functionality won't work. Cortana couldn't recognize events that were only scheduled in my Gmail calendar. Reading emails aloud or combing through Office 365 documents for keywords isn't in Cortana's current skill set either.

Invoke supports calls to mobile phone and landlines via Microsoft's Skype service. In the US, that means Invoke get free nationwide domestic calling. Once you've connected your Skype account in the Cortana app, you'll be able to call anyone from your Skype contacts, phone contacts or a local business. Cortana uses Bing search technology -- yes, the Microsoft corporate family is all here -- to help you find local business numbers. Connect your phone via bluetooth and it's easy to initiate calls with Cortana commands. I was able to call a fellow editor from my phone's contacts, as well as ask Cortana to call the nearest pharmacy.

Unlike Amazon and Google, Harman Kardon has a long and respected audio lineage, and that's why we had high hopes for the Invoke's sound quality. The speaker has three compact ""woofers,"" three tweeters and two passive radiators. On paper, that's a more formidable driver array than the $99 Echo and even the $399 Google Home Max.

I found the Invoke's 360-degree sound to deliver fuller bass and cleaner treble than Amazon's Echo line of speakers. But my colleague Ty Pendlebury compared the Invoke to the $199 Alexa-powered Sonos One ($199.00 at Amazon.com), and found it well matched -- though each speaker had its strengths and weaknesses:

Adjusting the volume via the turning dial feels good, but it's hard to get a great visual of exactly what volume level you're dialing to with a smoky LED circle. From a distance, it's difficult to see any light notifications, as the light on the very top is the only indicator of Cortana's activity. Seven microphones allow far-field listening and separate pipelines differentiate between audio playback and your voice. That means Cortana can hear you well from a distance and over the speaker's music.

Music streaming options are limited for now, though. You'll need Spotify premium in order to ask Cortana to play a specific song. Invoke also works with iHeartRadio and TuneIn, creating or playing stations per your request. With a Spotify premium account, you can ask Cortana to play a specific song. Pandora is not supported, but Harman Kardon says it is working to make it available.

Smart home control is where Invoke starts to lag behind. It currently supports SmartThings, Philips Hue, Nest, Wink and Insteon. That's not a bad start, and it will allow you to control lights, switches, outlets and thermostats. However, I'd like to see that list, as well as Cortana's set of skills, really expand. Harman Kardon say it's working with Honeywell, Ecobee, TP-Link, Johnson Controls, IFTT, Geeni, Iris by Lowe's and iDevices to integrate with Cortana. If those integrations happen soon, Invoke will be a much more viable smart home platform.

We tested the Invoke speaker with the Nest Thermostat E.  Connect your Nest account in the Cortana app and Cortana will adjust the temperature with phrases like ""Hey Cortana, make it warmer"" or ""Hey Cortana set the thermostat to 68 degrees.""

We tested Philips Hue's Cortana integration and while it did work well once we connected, that account connection process was significantly buggier. It took re-pairing the Hue bridge with a new e-mail in order to get things up and running. Once connected, Cortana can to turn on individual lights or a specific room, depending on what you've built in the Hue app.

Perhaps the most interesting part of Invoke's debut is Amazon and Microsoft's announcement of future Alexa and Cortana interoperability. In August, both companies stated that by the end of 2017, you'll be able to open one virtual assistant with the other by saying ""Alexa, open Cortana"" or vice versa. From there, you would be able to interact with Alexa or Cortana-specific skills. This supposedly symbiotic relationship looks to fill in the gaps for one another, giving Alexa users the ability to tap into Office 365, Outlook and other Cortana productivity skills. Is that something consumers will welcome? Microsoft and Amazon certainly think so.

Overall, Invoke gets Microsoft and Harman Kardon going in the right direction. Factor in a growing set of skills and brand integrations, and the Invoke is on the right track. But the competition here is formidable: Alexa-powered speakers -- Amazon's own Echoes, plus Sonos and Ultimate Ears -- are on fire, Google's ramping up with new Home models and Apple's HomePod is just weeks away.

In that environment, it's hard to tell someone to run out and get the Invoke. On the other hand, the speaker's superior sound quality and the promise of additional smart home compatibilities and -- especially -- that forthcoming Alexa tie-up make this Cortana-enabled speaker one that we'll be revisiting soon."
Your personal brewmaster, the HOPii, makes and pours you a cold one|"

A new automatic beer brewer called the HOPii wants to claim the middle ground between beer brewing machines like the PicoBrew and a simple at-home tap such as the Fizzics. And home brewers seem ready for the HOPii's easy approach to brewing: The product has raised more than $371,000 from 362 backers on Kickstarter, leaping over its initial crowdfunding goal of $50,000.

With the push of a button, the HOPii whips up a batch of fresh brew with a process that thankfully doesn't involve anything gross, like making beer from concentrate. The HOPii's creators take care of the first two steps of beer brewing (the mash and the boil), which creates unfermented beer called wort. The company will send you an ingredient pack with a big bottle of wort, a packet of yeast and any extras you need to finish the recipe. Then, you put everything in place and hit start, and the HOPii takes care of the rest. You'll even be able pour the beer from the HOPii's built-in tap when the beer is finished.

The HOPii allows you to drink freshly made beer while getting around the strict guidelines for shipping alcoholic liquid from state to state (the fermentation step is what makes wort alcoholic). In theory, this would let you try beers from brewers that don't distribute to your area. However, the HOPii will begin with an offering of only 12 recipes -- all made by the HOPii team. Company reps say they're working on adding partnerships with other breweries.

The HOPii unit is temperature-controlled and recognizes the type of beer you're brewing from the bottle of wort. Supposedly, it creates the ideal fermentation conditions for that type of beer, and it can clean and sanitize itself when you're done brewing.

My main concern with the HOPii's approach is that it goes against the common brewing practice of introducing your yeast to your wort as soon as possible. The sugars in wort are purposely primed to react with yeast, so wort can easily get infected if something in the air starts reacting with those sugars first. With the HOPii, the volatile wort is shipped and could be in the container for weeks before you put it into the machine and start fermenting.

A rep from HOPii reassured me that they've worked with multiple third-party labs on quality control. The wort containers are airtight and block out light as well, and they have a shelf life of up to a month.

You can preorder the HOPii on Kickstarter now for a discount. The first machines are scheduled to ship worldwide in the summer of 2018. Once the final product is ready, the HOPii will be available on Amazon and will ship in time for the 2018 holidays. The retail price will be a hefty $600, which converts to approximately £450 and AU$750. Ingredient packs will be $20 to $30 a piece (£15/£20 and AU$25/AU$40) and will produce 3 liters of beer. That measures out to about eight glasses of beer per batch, so roughly $3 for each 12-ounce glass you drink.

That's a lot to spend on a beer gadget, but it's not as much as the $800 PicoBrew Pico. Still, I'd hope the HOPii will offer a greater variety of brews by the time the product is finished.

Certain Kickstarter backers can also use the HOPii to ferment their homebrew recipes in precisely controlled conditions. That'd be a great extra if HOPii rolled it out to the final product, but for now, the company is only offering it on preordered machines."
This battery-powered security camera fits on your front door|"

Remo+, formerly known as Olive & Dove, is back with a new DIY home security device: the DoorCam.

The DoorCam is a $199 battery-powered door-mounted outdoor camera. Available for preorder on the Remo+ online store, DoorCams are expected to ship later in October. Remo+ will start shipping DoorCams internationally later in 2017; at the current exchange rate, $199 converts to roughly £150 and AU$250.

So what can a DoorCam do? Here's what Remo+ has to say:

Remo+ hasn't yet responded with the particulars of its video clip storage or whether the DoorCam has night vision.

I'm really intrigued by this concept. Plenty of folks won't like the idea of having a security camera essentially draping over their front door (installation looks simple, though -- roughly the same as installing an over-the-door hook or storage rack).

Its unique design addresses (and potentially solves) a major issue with Wi-Fi-enabled outdoor camera installations: poor connectivity. Hanging the camera's Wi-Fi chipset and antenna inside the door and the camera outside, Remo+ says, reduces interference.

It makes sense, but we'll have to try it out for ourselves to know for sure.

GardenSpace acts as sentry and caretaker of your garden|"

Like other smart plant sensors, GardenSpace knows when your flowers need a drink. Debuting Tuesday on Kickstarter, this tall garden sentry goes a couple of steps beyond the norm by actually watering your plants for you and spraying away pests.

GardenSpace looks over your garden during the day and takes pics to monitor the health of your plants and water them as necessary. You can use the app to tell GardenSpace what you're growing, and get more detailed care advice as well.

Combining info from an infrared thermometer, an infrared camera and a normal RGB cam mounted on the front of its rotating head, GardenSpace calculates the water stress levels and the general health of your garden. It can monitor up to 100 square feet -- providing customized care to any plant in that radius.

At night, GardenSpace doubles as a sentry, and uses its motion sensors to watch for and ward away critters with a spray of water.

It's solar-powered with a backup battery for a cloudy day, and it's pretty easy to set up -- stake it in the ground and attach an ordinary hose. I got to see GardenSpace in action and it's taller than I expected -- it came up to my waist. That height gives it a bird's eye view of the action and the proper angle to spray water anywhere in its radius.

The app wasn't ready for a demo yet. Supposedly, it'll be able to walk you through any extra care steps you need to give your plant and will also be able to give advice about what to grow and when to plant it.

I certainly like the idea of a smart garden gadget that will take the day-to-day maintenance and guesswork off of my plate. Plus, GardenSpace doubles as a kind of security guard for your garden, so if it fulfills its promises, it'll be much more of an active aid in your quest for a green thumb than the other plant sensors we've tested.

GardenSpace will start shipping to Kickstarter backers at this time next year. You can preorder it now at a discount. At retail, the sensor have a hefty $400 price tag -- so it'll need to live up to its potential to be worth that kind of splurge. GardenSpace will be available internationally, and the US price converts to approximately £300 and AU$500."
Sylvania's new Zigbee smart bulb costs just $12|"

Timing is everything. Just weeks after Amazon announced a new ""Echo Plus"" smart speaker with a built-in Zigbee radio for direct control of Zigbee smart home gadgets, Ledvance is introducing a new line of low-cost Sylvania Smart Plus Zigbee lights starting at just $12 each.

In fact, at $12, the A-shaped 60W replacement is one of the most affordable big-brand smart bulbs we've seen. $15 for a smart BR30 floodlight and $20 for a weatherproof PAR38 floodlight are good deals, too.

The most exciting part (at least for smart lighting nerds like me) might be that $20 PAR38-shaped bulb. People ask me all the time for a smart floodlight they can use outdoors that doesn't cost too much, and there aren't a lot of good options out there. Sylvania's bulb should fill the void nicely.

All three are decent light bulbs in their own right, too. In terms of brightness, the A-shaped bulb promises the standard 800 lumens that you'd expect from a 60W replacement. Our spectrometer measured it at 837 lumens, with a soft white color temperature of 2,740 K, which is just what you want. With 813 lumens, the BR30-shaped bulb came in brighter than advertised, too. I measured the PAR38 bulb at 1,024 lumens -- just shy of the stated 1,050 lumens, but well within our setup's 5 percent margin of error. In short, all three earn a passing grade as far as specs are concerned.

If you aren't familiar, Zigbee is a wireless protocol that devices can use to communicate with each other, just like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It's the same protocol used by Philips Hue smart bulbs and by a wide range of other lights, locks and smart home gadgets. The only catch is that most routers don't speak Zigbee, so you'll need a Zigbee-fluent control hub like the Echo Plus ($149.99 at Amazon.com), the Philips Hue Bridge, the Wink Hub, the SmartThings Hub or Sylvania's own plug-in gateway to act as translator.

The idea is that you'll screw the Sylvania Smart Plus bulb in and turn it on, then connect it with a hub like one of those. From there, you'll be able to control it remotely using your phone, or schedule automated lighting changes. The specific types of automations available will depend on what hub you're using -- for instance, some simply let you program times for the bulbs to come on and off, while others will also let you sync them up with motion detectors or schedule slow fades to help ease you out of bed in the morning.

Integrations will vary from hub to hub, too. Whether it's Alexa or Nest, Apple HomeKit or Google Home, your hub will determine what platforms your bulbs work with (fortunately, our handy CNET Compatibility Tracker can help you sort out what works with what).

Whatever Zigbee hub you're using, the bottom line is that these new Sylvania bulbs will likely work with it, and they won't cost you very much compared with other connected bulbs.

One other note: Things are a little bit jumbled with Sylvania's branding these days. Walk through the lighting aisle at your local hardware store, and you might see bulbs and lighting products under the names Sylvania, Osram, Lightify and Ledvance -- all of which look alike.

""It's confusing, I know,"" a Ledvance spokesperson admitted, so I asked him for a quick rundown:

""Ledvance is our company name,"" he explained. ""We used to be a part of the company Osram, which owns the Lightify app, gateway and brand.  We separated from Osram last July.  Ledvance sells Sylvania general lighting products in the US and Canada.

""We are hoping to simplify things by moving our smart lighting products to the Sylvania Smart Plus brand,"" he added, before also pointing out that Sylvania's Zigbee bulbs will work with the existing Osram Lightify plug-in gateway.

That Sylvania Smart Plus lineup also includes other kinds of smart lights, including bulbs that work with Apple HomeKit. These Zigbee bulbs do not, but they share the same ""Sylvania Smart Plus"" branding. At any rate, you'll want to make sure you're buying the right light before you pull the trigger.

Sylvania's new Zigbee lineup is available today on Amazon, and will roll out to major retailers in the weeks ahead. We'll test them out with as many Zigbee hubs as we can out at the CNET Smart Home -- stay tuned for an update."
igloohome Smart Deadbolt 02 review:|"

Singapore-based startup igloohome released its second generation deadbolt this year. The Deadbolt 02 is a sleek and simple bluetooth deadbolt with a keypad and physical key. If you're looking for a Bluetooth lock with a touchscreen keypad, the $199 Deadbolt 02 is a sensible choice.

The Deadbolt 02 works via Bluetooth, turning your phone into a Bluetooth key. The touchscreen keypad locks and unlocks your door with a PIN. Having both of these options makes the Deadbolt 02 a valid alternative to using a traditional unconnected lock. You can still access your home with a physical key, though you will need a sharp object to depress a button on a rather flimsy-feeling plastic cover to reveal the keyhole.

Installation is simple enough. Instructions aren't included in the box, but they are available on the app or igloohome's website. Four AA batteries power the lock, and you'll receive notifications when they're running low. If you find yourself locked out of the house with the lock's batteries dead, you can jump start the lock with a 9V battery and two nodes built into the base of the lock.

The igloohome app, available on Google Play and the App Store, manages most major features of the lock. From here, you can set individual PINs or send Bluetooth keys to friends and family. You can also view battery life, schedule temporary PINs and see an activity log. The Deadbolt 02 system allows up to 285 active PINs at a time. Once you've reached the maximum, you'll need to clear your PIN list to add more.

An Airbnb Connect feature currently free and in beta testing syncs with your Airbnb calendar and auto-generates a PIN for each scheduled guest. Once the beta testing phase is complete, this service will cost $5 per lock per month. To me, that seems like a big price tag for something I could probably manage myself.

Igloohome put in the work to make this deadbolt secure. A tamper alarm sounds if someone tries to pry the lock from the door. Decoy numbers give you the option to enter up to eight digits before your real PIN. This keeps intruders from guessing your PIN by studying the smudged fingerprints you'll inevitably put on the glossy keypad. A security lockout feature stops the lock from operating for five minutes if an invalid PIN is entered five times.

My biggest disappointment with the Deadbolt 02 was app functionality. It's not possible to lock the deadbolt from the app, and I found myself wishing I could lock the door the same way I unlocked it. To lock it without a physical key you have three options: hold down the # sign on the keypad, turn the physical knob on the inside of the door or set up igloohome's timed re-lock feature. With timed re-lock, the deadbolt will lock anywhere from five seconds to 120 seconds after it's unlocked, depending on the amount of time you've specified. The re-lock feature is set up by entering a series of digits into the keypad, but I really wish it were managed through the app.

I also found it disappointing that you can't view lock status in the app. It works more like a remote control than a monitoring tool. An ""easy unlock"" feature currently in beta mode, only removes the need to tap the unlock button in the app. You'll still need to have the app open to unlock the door. This means you're still pulling out your phone and opening an app to access your home. Thankfully, the problems presented by the app are easily solved by using the keypad. Entering my PIN proved to be the fastest way to open the door.

Other smart locks ($150.00 at Amazon.com) like the third generation $150 August Smart Lock offer more features. Add a $79 Wi-Fi module to that lock or the August Smart Lock Pro, and you'll get Alexa, Google and Nest compatibility along with the ability to control your lock from anywhere via the app. While the Deadbolt 02 doesn't offer a Wi-Fi module, Zigbee or Z-Wave compatibility, it does give you a great looking keypad, Bluetooth keys for visitors and a physical key.

Igloohome's Deadbolt 02 is available on the igloohome website, Amazon and other online retailers for $199. Sleek and simple to use, this deadbolt is a good fit for anyone looking for a keypad lock with simple Bluetooth functionality."
Kenmore's new smart fridges work with Amazon's Alexa|"

Kenmore, the appliance brand owned by Sears, has strengthened its ties to Amazon. Its new line of internet-connected refrigerators will work with the Alexa voice-activated digital assistant, the company announced this week at the Smart Kitchen Summit in Seattle.

The Wi-Fi-enabled refrigerators will send alerts to your phone if you leave a door open, when you need to replace a filter and if there are power outages. You'll also be able to adjust your freezer and refrigerator temperatures when you're away.

You can buy one of the fridges, the Kenmore Elite 24-cubic-foot Counter-Depth French Door Bottom-Mount Smart Refrigerator, now for $2,499. The rest of the line will be available in December.

The refrigerators, along with Kenmore's other smart appliances, work with Alexa thanks to a Skill called Kenmore Smart. If you have one of the appliances and an Alexa-enabled smart speaker, you enable the Kenmore Smart Skill within the Alexa app and link your accounts. From there, you can give voice commands to Alexa regarding your Kenmore product, such as, ""Alexa, ask Kenmore Smart, 'What is my freezer temperature?'""

Kenmore first signaled its growing relationship with Amazon in June, when it announced that its appliances would be available to order through the online retailer.

As Sears continues to close many of its stores, the company's efforts to work with Amazon show that it plans to extend the life of the Kenmore name by embracing the online marketplace and internet-connected appliances.

Update, 7:15 p.m.: Adds new price, reduced after the initial Kenmore announcement."
Philips 60W Replacement WarmGlow LED (clear glass) review:|"

Low-cost, high-efficiency LED light bulbs are now more norm than exception in your local lighting aisle, and that means manufacturers are starting to get creative in order to stand out. One good example: the ""WarmGlow"" line of dimmable LEDs from Philips. Dim each one's brightness, and the color temperature will fall with it, changing from a bright, yellowy 2,700 K to an orange, candle-like glow.

It's a subtle effect that's intended to mimic the color of an old-school incandescent filament, so it only made sense for Philips to trot the feature out in a bulb with an old-school design. That bulb, the clear glass version of the Philips 60W Replacement WarmGlow LED, sells in a two-pack at Home Depot stores for a little less than $12.

A price of $6 per bulb is basically the average going rate for a dimmable 60-watt replacement LED these days, so you're not paying a premium for that WarmGlow dimming. Even if WarmGlow leaves you cold, the bulb's specs are solid enough to make the bulb a good value in its own right.

The only real issue with the bulb is that its faux-filament build means that the light it puts out includes some potentially ugly shadows. Each ""filament"" is actually just a bunch of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged in a column. Some of those little columns of light face inward, which means they cast shadows of the other columns sitting in their way. A similar bulb from GE had the same problem, though not as pronounced as with the WarmGlow LED.

Maybe that's supposed to be part of the old-fashioned effect, but to me, it makes for an unpleasant spread of light -- especially when the bulb shines from under a lampshade.

In fairness, people probably aren't going to buy this bulb just to hide it under a lampshade (and if they are, they should just get the standard WarmGlow LED without the old-fashioned design). Those fake filaments are really meant for exposed bulb fixtures, where you might want a more nostalgic-looking bulb, even if it comes with a couple of shadows.

The old-school WarmGlow LED compares favorably to the original. Like that bulb, it shines brighter than the stated 800 lumens, coming in at 855 lumens when I tested it out (I clocked the original at 838 lumens). You get that light from a power draw of 8.5 watts -- one watt less than the original. More light from less power? Sounds good to me.

In fact, at 855 lumens, the bulb is putting out over 100 lumens per watt, which is very, very good as far as efficiency is concerned. Use it for 3 hours per day, on average, and it'll add about a buck to your yearly energy bill. By comparison, an actual old-school 60W incandescent will add about $7 to your yearly bill.

That means that if you upgrade to the WarmGlow LED, it'll pay for itself in a year, then continue shining for another decade or so. Philips clocks the expected lifespan at 13.7 years, and backs that up with a three-year warranty.

Still, the specs aren't perfect. Other LEDs from names like Cree and Osram offer warranties as long as 10 years, and many competitors promise lifespans almost twice as long as the WarmGlow LED's. The bulb is also pretty average at color rendering, leaving a predictably yellow haze over things instead of making colors and whites look vivid and true.

It does well on dimmer switches, though, which is important given how central dimming is to this bulb's appeal. I was able to dial it smoothly down to zero on every switch I tested it on, and never noticed any issues with flicker or buzz. The light showed a very slight stutter as I dimmed it up and down on an old rotary dial designed for incandescents, but it still looked steady at all settings.

All in all, the WarmGlow LED is a bit of a novelty, but a perfectly good light bulb in its own right. You've got a lot of great options in the lighting aisle these days, but if you like the vintage-style looks of faux-filament bulbs like this one (and if you can tolerate those shadows), then the WarmGlow LED is a pretty decent pick at $6 each."
August Doorbell Cam Pro review:|"

The $199 Doorbell Cam Pro (roughly £155/AU$266 converted) is August's second-gen smart buzzer. With solid HD livestreaming, motion alerts, two-way audio and integration with Nest and Amazon Alexa, the Doorbell Cam Pro is competitive with Ring and SkyBell models. Almost.

Instead of offering night vision like its competition, this doorbell has an integrated LED floodlight to assist in low-light conditions. While this allows you to view the feed in color rather than gray scale, the video quality isn't as good as what you'd get with night vision. August also charges $5 per month for its cloud storage service. Ring's subscription is just $3 per month and SkyBell offers free cloud storage. And, at nearly 3 inches wide, this square August buzzer won't easily fit on a standard door frame.

Still, August's Doorbell Cam Pro is a very good option -- especially if you want to use it with an August Smart Lock or Smart Lock Pro. If you don't, consider Ring's Video Doorbell 2 or the SkyBell HD instead.

While the Doorbell Cam Pro's price is in-line with Ring's Video Doorbell 2 and the SkyBell HD, it has lower video resolution, a narrower field of view and a higher cloud storage fee. It also relies on integrated LEDs to provide light at night. The floodlight ensures that you can view your video in color rather than traditional night vision's gray scale, but the video clarity suffered somewhat.

The Kuna and Toucan outdoor security cameras work similarly. Designed as porch light cameras, they borrow light from whatever bulb you're using instead of night vision tech. As a result, the quality of the live video feed often struggles in low-light conditions.

August's Android and iOS app makes it easy to install and set up your Doorbell Cam Pro. Simply download the app on your device of choice and follow the step-by-step instructions.

The app will ask you what device you want to install and take you straight into the configuration process. Note: August wants you to connect your Doorbell Cam Pro to your local Wi-Fi network before you install it outside. Plug the included USB-compatible dock into a wall outlet and set your doorbell on it. A white pulsing light should appear; if it doesn't press the ""reset"" button on the back of the doorbell's faceplate.

From there, you'll be instructed to both name your doorbell and the house where you installed it -- I named our doorbell ""Front Door"" and the house ""CNET Smart Home."" You'll then enter your Wi-Fi details and begin installation.

Go back to your doorbell and give it a try to make sure everything's properly connected. If your chime sounds, you're ready to start using your doorbell. Keep in mind that the Doorbell Cam Pro only works with mechanical chimes; digital chimes and intercom systems aren't supported.

Not sure if your buzzer wiring will work? Find out more here.

August's $199 Doorbell Cam Pro performed well throughout testing. The app is easy to navigate, the settings are easy to customize and the live feed and related motion alerts are responsive. Connecting the Doorbell Cam Pro to an Amazon Echo Show speaker is simple, too. Open the Alexa app, search for the August Smart Home skill (not to be confused with the August Home skill, which is exclusively for August smart locks). Select enable, enter login information for your August account and then say, ""Alexa, show me the front door/whatever you named your doorbell."" That way, you can view your camera's live feed on a slightly bigger screen.

You can also pair an August Smart Lock Pro or August Smart Lock to your doorbell so you can lock/unlock the door straight from the app's live screen.

August's $199 Doorbell Cam Pro is a good buzzer, made even better if you have a compatible August lock to add to the equation. If you don't, the Doorbell Cam Pro isn't the best choice. It has a lower resolution, a smaller field of view and a pricier cloud subscription than Ring and SkyBell. It's also the widest smart buzzer I've tested and its floodlight didn't work quite as well as traditional night vision technology. Consider the Ring Video Doorbell 2, SkyBell HD or even the $249 Ring Video Doorbell Pro if you're on the fence."
Netgear is back with a better, smarter Arlo security camera|"

Netgear, maker of the Arlo series of DIY home security cameras, is back with a new model -- the Arlo Pro ($221.44 at Amazon.com) 2. Like its predecessors, the Arlo Pro 2 is an indoor/outdoor camera that requires a base station to operate. Existing Arlo customers with a compatible base station can purchase standalone Pro 2 cameras for $220 each. Two- and four-camera kits are also available with a base station included for $480 and $800.

The Arlo Pro 2 will be sold internationally. Prices convert to roughly £170 and AU$280 for a single camera, £365/AU$615 for the two-camera kit and £610/AU$1,025 for the four-camera kit.

Here are the Pro 2's main features:

The Arlo Pro 2 also works with IFTTT, Wink, Samsung's SmartThings, and Alexa. If you have an Amazon Fire TV Stick, you can ask Alexa to display a video feed of your front door/backyard/garage entrance camera on your TV.

Netgear also tells me its Arlo Pro 2 is ""more responsive to motion."" Its motion sensor is apparently in an ""always on"" mode in low power, so it can capture the seconds leading up to a motion event in addition to the event itself. How many seconds it records leading up to a motion event will vary depending on whether your camera is connected to an adapter or relying on battery power. The same goes for activity zones and optional 24/7 cloud recording; the Arlo Pro 2 has to be wired for these to work (and you'll need an Arlo subscription for continuous cloud recording).

Click here to read more about Netgear's available subscription plans.

I'm intrigued by the upgrade from 720 to 1080p, as well as the option to use it as a wired camera (in addition to the standard battery option). The base station seems unnecessary, though. It does have a built-in siren to act as an added security feature, but it doesn't appear to offer much benefit otherwise. Netgear says it's a ""battery booster,"" which could prove particularly useful since the Pro 2 supports 1080p video (and could drain your battery faster as a result).

Netgear's original Arlo camera was among the first battery-powered indoor/outdoor models available on the DIY market. Rated for wind, rain and cold weather, the 720p HD Arlo cam ($197.00 at Amazon.com) is highly capable. But, it requires expensive and hard to find CR123 batteries. You can still buy the Arlo camera starting at $180/£200/AU$277 for a one-camera kit, plus a first-gen base station.

Netgear then introduced the Arlo Pro, a camera very similar to the first-gen model, except that it's equipped with a rechargeable lithium ion battery. The Pro model will also continue to be sold for $250/£300/AU$499.

The new Arlo Pro 2 is available for purchase now and we'll share our impressions as soon as we get our hands on one.

Vivint Smart Home review:|"

Smart home security systems are an ever-increasing market, and you have a lot to consider before declaring allegiance. Vivint's Smart Home is a good option for a monitored smart home with no long-term contracts. The $550 starter kit price tag isn't outrageous, but be prepared to pay at least $40 monthly for security monitoring, app control and other features that are pretty much mandatory for your system to have any smarts. Compatibility with Amazon's Alexa, Google Home and Nest thermostats makes Vivint's platform a solid choice, as long as you know what you're getting into.

Vivint's starter kit includes a touchscreen SkyControl panel and choice of six smart sensors. Take your pick of door/window sensors, motion detector, glass break detector, flood/freeze sensors, smoke detector or carbon monoxide detector.

From there, you can add additional devices a la carte. Additional door/window sensors, for example, cost $35. Vivint's products also work with the Nest Thermostat and you can purchase this and an Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) as part of your Vivint package.

We tested several of Vivint's products at the CNET Smart Home where Rich, our Vivint Smart Home pro, installed our devices and ensured everything was running smoothly. Installation is priced at $198, but some promotions waive this fee. We put the system through a host of everyday scenarios with multiple users and schedules.

At the center of the Vivint suite of products is the 7-inch SkyControl panel. This white, wall-mounted control center acts as your home base for every device. Controlling and adjusting all your devices here is pretty straightforward. The panel's size and shape feels a bit clunky, but the interface is simple and easy to navigate. The SkyControl panel can run on backup battery power and a cellular connection, so it will continue to work when your power or Wi-Fi goes out.

If you're not at home, you can use your Vivint app, a mobile version of the SkyControl panel, for controls and notifications. There's also a four-digit PIN to access the panel for added security.

Among the additional products Vivint offers are a few interesting camera options. With the exception of two AT&T Digital Life plans that cost $55 and $65, most home security starter kits on the market won't include cameras or doorbells. Vivint doesn't include any cameras out of the box, but it does allow you to add devices to the starter kit and essentially create your own package when you sign up. Package prices vary depending on what you buy, but you'll be able to get all the devices you want in one purchase and one installation.

Vivint's doorbell camera costs $230 and offers you a first look at the front door. It resembles a normal doorbell, but with an added camera eye and a lighted button that triggers a chime from the SkyControl panel and notifies your mobile app. Two-way talk and one-way video mean you can see and speak to people at the door and they can hear and reply. On-demand live video from the Vivint app allows you to view your front door remotely at any time. The doorbell camera features a 180-degree wide-angle view and good night vision. It also boasts ""smart visitor detection"" so you aren't notified every time a car drives by. However, we did receive several notifications due to one very persistent flying insect.

Vivint offers two additional cameras. The $200 Ping camera, intended for indoor use, and a $300 outdoor camera. What I really like about the Ping camera is two-way talk. You can view the camera's feed and speak to the room's occupants from anywhere via the app. Alternately, anyone in the room with the camera can push a button on top of the camera to call you. The outdoor camera works much like a traditional security camera and you can view it via the app or panel. All three of these cameras include night vision and mobile alerts and record 20-second video clips when motion is detected.

For an additional $10 more a month, your starter Vivint subscription fee turns into the Smart Home Video service plan, which includes 30 days of continuous DVR recording for up to four cameras if you've purchased a 1TB Vivint Smart Drive for $250. While that's very expensive for a 1TB drive, 30-day continuous recording for four cameras is included. The $50-per-month service plan and $249 Smart Drive combo costs $840 for the first year. By comparison, Nest Aware for four cameras will cost $75 per month or $750 for a discounted annual subscription.

Purchasing the Vivint Smart Drive isn't mandatory, though. You can purchase cameras and pay just the $50 per month video service plan. That extra $10 per month provides the ability to play back, save, download and share video. Without the Vivint Smart Drive, you'll have access to 10 days of video clips.

Vivint purchased cloud storage startup Space Monkey in 2014, renaming it Vivint Smart Drive. We reviewed the drive when it was still called Space Monkey, and Vivint uses this same distributed cloud storage system for continuous DVR recording with cameras and doorbells.

Vivint's smart home system works with Alexa and Google Assistant. Alexa has a wide skill set of Vivint commands. Beyond basic system arming commands, you can ask if the garage door is closed or tell Alexa to turn down the temperature by 3 degrees. And yes, a Vivint installer will get all that integration up and running for you during the initial setup.

Getting consumers to buy in to the professional smart home hasn't been easy. Vivint's recently revised payment options aim to solve the pricing problem that drives so many consumers away from smart home security systems. Vivint Flex Pay, modeled after the cell phone market, works in partnership with Citizens Bank. Customers may purchase a smart home package, including installation, with a zero-percent (0% APR) interest installment loan.

At the start of the loan, you'll enter into a service agreement priced at $40 per month for Smart Security or $50 per month for Smart Home Video. The service agreement runs the length of your loan, and includes 24/7 professional monitoring with emergency response, cellular connection, 30-day video storage, customer support, in-home service and equipment protection. If you'd prefer to pay for your devices up front, there is a no-contract option.

The biggest downside to the Vivint Smart Home is what you'll lose should you choose to forgo any monthly monitoring. Without monitoring, the system will act as a local alarm only for burglary, fire and other alerts. Emergency services won't be called. The biggest losses, though, are the essentials that make your home feel smart. That's where consumers may start to feel a little pinched.

You'll lose voice control for Alexa and Google and access to the Vivint app. No app means no mobile alerts, answering the doorbell remotely or viewing your home's camera feeds off-site. No voice control means you must control everything via the SkyControl panel. You also won't receive 24/7 customer support, a warranty for defective products or discounted technician visits past the 90-day free period should any hardware need attention.

And of course, there are terms and conditions for moving. Depending on where you are in your agreement, there could be a $99 move fee. If you've been a customer for at least a year and sign a new agreement for your new residence, Vivint will waive the fee.

If you're really into commitment and on board with monthly monitoring, Vivint has a solid system here. It offers everything we've come to expect in smart home security and it's compatible with Alexa or Google. Vivint's cameras work well and offer more than a few nice features. However, you've got to play by its rules. If you're not paying at least $40 per month for monitoring services, you'll lose a lot of smart home functionality.

The SmartThings and ADT home security system offers no-contract monitoring as well. Even without monitoring, you'll still get notifications on your phone and a control panel that acts as a SmartThings hub. SmartThings and ADT have yet to release any cameras or doorbells for this platform.

If you don't mind a two-year agreement, AT&T Digital Life includes the most devices and a camera with recorded video a competitively priced $55-per-month package. There's no touchscreen panel, but you can control your system from a tablet or mobile app. Early termination fees can be as high as $840, depending on which package you choose.

Xfinity Home by Comcast is similar to AT&T Digital Life in its two-year agreement structure, and it's cheaper. However, you'll only get a touchscreen panel, three sensors, a motion detector and a keypad in its $25 per month monitored package. Additional thermostats, smart plugs and door/window detectors were also a bit pricier than Vivint's.

If you don't want a long-term contract, Ring's new security system is definitely worth a look. For $10 per month or $100 per year, you'll get 60 days of live and recorded video for an unlimited number of cameras. Those cameras aren't included in the basic security system package, but Ring's doorbells and cameras are competitively priced, starting at $179. Additional sensors and detectors start at $20. Monitoring by Ring is $10 per month. The $199 security kit is available for preorder now and ships in November. You'll get a base, a keypad, two sensors and one motion detector.

Any way you slice it, a complete smart home security system is pricey. What it really comes down to is if you want monitoring and if you'd like to create your own smart home system. If building your smart home system piece by piece doesn't sound like a fun Friday night, let Vivint install the devices you want, then decide how you'd like to pay and move on with your life. You'll have a solid, professionally monitored system and peace of mind."
Lifx Beam is a color-changing, voice-activated stick-up light|"

Here's how you can tell that Lifx is betting big on Apple HomeKit support to help sell lots and lots of color-changing lights: In the less than two weeks since that long-awaited support for HomeKit finally went live, the smart lighting manufacturer has unveiled three new products.

The latest is called Lifx Beam, and it's a set of color-changing light bars that you'll stick to your walls to help liven the place up a little. Each bar is about 12 inches long and contains 10 distinct ""zones"" of color that you can control, program, and animate using the Lifx app on your Android, iOS, or Windows device. You get six bars plus a power adapter for $200, AU$280 in Australia, or €230 in Europe and the UK (about £205, converted roughly). Kits ship out this November, Lifx says.

From the sounds of it, the Lifx Beam light bars and their amazing Technicolor dreamzones will work a lot like the Lifx Z color-changing light strip. You'll stick both up using 3M sticky tabs, which come included, and connect segments together at their ends to form a continuous line of color-changing light. The only difference: the Lifx Z is flexible, while the Lifx Beam isn't.

It still bends, though -- at least, sort of. In addition to the six beams, each starter kit comes with a single, color-changing corner piece that can connect two bars at a 90 degree angle like in the picture shown. Lifx tells me that each power adapter can support up to eight beams and two corner pieces. No word yet on how much an extra beam or corner piece will set you back, though.

Like other Lifx products, the Lifx Beam kit uses Wi-Fi to connect directly to your router, so you don't need any extra hub hardware. It will also work with all three major smart home voice control platforms -- Alexa, Siri and the Google Assistant. You'll also find a Lifx channel on the free, online automation service IFTTT, as well as integrations with other third parties like Logitech and Nest.

All of that helps Lifx stay competitive with its color-changing competitors. The closest as far as the Beam is concerned would be Nanoleaf, which already sells a set of triangular, color-changing ""Aurora"" panels that also work with the major voice assistants. No major competitor currently offers stick-up light bars, though.

At the same time, the Beam seems like a bit of a niche novelty (which is really saying something in the color-changing smart light category). Folks looking to outfit their smart homes with modern, eye-catching displays will likely be intrigued, but time will tell if that's enough to gin up the sort of sales Lifx is probably hoping for.

Combined with the Lifx Z strips and with the Lifx Tile wall panels (one of the other new products announced in just the last few days), the brand seems to be expanding its emphasis on decorative lighting. At the very least, the company seems quite comfortable thinking beyond the bulb, which might indicate a potential trend for smart home lighting.

Of course, you can still stick with Lifx bulbs if you so choose. The newest of which, a lineup of small Lifx Mini bulbs, is set to start shipping by the end of October."
Protect your home with Ring's DIY security system|"

Ring is expanding its smart home device lineup with the new Protect security system, announced Monday. The Protect is available for preorder now on Ring's website, as well as at Best Buy and Home Depot in the US. The Ring starter kit costs $199 for a base station, a keypad, a contact sensor, a passive infrared motion sensor and a Z-Wave extender.

While the Protect's Z-Wave-enabled hub and sensor devices are fairly standard issue for a DIY security system, its $199 starting price is significantly lower  than its direct competition. Google's Nest introduced its own DIY system in September starting at $499 for a hub, two door/window sensors and two arm/disarm key fobs. Samsung's SmartThings and professional security firm ADT also announced their own system Monday, with optional monitoring from, you guessed it, ADT. Its starter kit will set you back $550.

Here's an overview of Ring's Protect:

We're tracking down a review unit of Protect, so check back soon to see how it compares to Nest's Secure and SmartThings' ADT system. The Protect is expected to start shipping later this month.

SmartThings and ADT tackle DIY smart home monitoring|"

Samsung's SmartThings boasts a robust network of DIY smart home automation devices and partnerships. Now, SmartThings is joining forces with security company ADT. Available for preorder today on Best Buy and Samsung's websites, the $550 starter kit and $200 expansion pack offer a suite of home security and automation products eligible for professional monitoring by ADT without the strings of a long-term contract. Both kits are expected to be available exclusively at Best Buy stores on Oct. 29.

What's in the $550 starter kit:

What's in the $200 expansion kit:

In addition to the starter and expansion packs, a key fob remote enables three functions: alarm on, alarm off and panic.

While there are no long-term contracts or mandatory service agreements, ADT will monitor what it calls ""life safety"" products, namely those included in the expansion pack, for $15 per month. For $25 per month, ADT will monitor the ""home security"" products in the starter kit for intrusion. An introductory offer gives a $5 discount to customers who purchase both services, making ADT's full service monitoring $35. Customers can cancel or sign up for services at anytime through a corresponding app.

Despite some reliability woes last year, SmartThings feels confident in its metrics and ability to support smart home security. Every device offered in the starter kit functions with 900 MHz dual-encryption wireless technology and is built to the same standards as ADT's professionally installed products. To be monitored by ADT, you must use these specially encrypted devices, which you can also purchase as additional accessories. The 900 MHz system was designed exclusively for this effort. SmartThings and ADT say this encryption will help to safeguard against false alarms that often cost consumers hundreds of dollars in municipal fines.

The hub of this new security system is the Samsung SmartThings ADT Panel. The 7-inch touchscreen panel works as the main interface for products in the kits, but also functions as a SmartThings hub. This means someone purchasing the starter kit could continue to expand their home automation with any of the current ""works with SmartThings"" products. Zigbee and Z-wave antenna and certification are built into the panel, as well as a siren for alerts. The panel runs on AC power and communicates via Wi-Fi, but includes 7-day battery backup and LTE backup from Verizon wireless, allowing customers to contact ADT in the event of a power outage.

SmartThings and ADT are aiming to bridge the gap for consumers (read: millennials) who want to protect and secure their smart home, and be actively involved in customizing their ecosystem. SmartThings confirmed nothing has changed with regard to open API and third party developers.

Traditionally, price, long-term contracts and false alarms have kept customers from taking the plunge. SmartThings and ADT are hoping this new line of products will combat these reservations.

Is this finally the perfect marriage of security monitoring and home automation? How will it stack up against the Nest Secure system? We'll see, as the Samsung SmartThings ADT Home Security line of products roll out this October.

Samsung RF265BEAESR French Door Family Hub Refrigerator review:|"

Samsung swung for the smart fridge fences with the Family Hub, an out-and-proud connected refrigerator with ingredient-tracking cameras and a whopping 21.5-inch touchscreen on the door. I liked that fridge a lot more than I thought I would, but with retail prices starting at more than $5,000, it was much too expensive for most folks to justify a purchase.

Enter Family Hub 2.0, which sees Samsung expanding the fleet in year two to include new models that are less fancy -- and less expensive -- than before. The cheapest of the bunch is the RF265BEAESR, a basic French door model in plain stainless steel. Originally priced at $3,299, the model has enjoyed regular discounts since its debut. As of writing this, Samsung has it listed on sale for $2,299, which is downright reasonable for a dumb French door fridge, let alone a smart one.

The trade-off is that you no longer get a luxurious, four-door build or a ""Flex Zone"" capable of switching between fridge and freezer settings depending on what you want to put in it, but those are acceptable sacrifices for people who just want those touchscreen smarts at the lowest price possible. The good news: those smarts are just as smart as before -- which is to say that they aren't perfect, but they're a little better than you might expect. And, with Samsung's Bixby voice assistant set to arrive in Family Hub fridges via software update at some point in the future, those smarts stand to improve with time.

The cheaper Family Hub isn't the stunner that its predecessor was, and it isn't a must-have by any stretch, but it's still a decent refrigerator with compelling features you won't find anywhere else. If it fills you with skepticism, then feel free to skip it, but if that touchscreen inspires fridge envy, it's never been more affordable. I say anything under $2,500 is a pretty fair price for it.

In the case of the new, cheaper Family Hub, the answer is everything that last year's more expensive Family Hub can do. Some of the highlights include:

The better question might be what can't the Family Hub do yet. The big omission is Bixby voice controls, which Samsung has long been promising. They'll arrive sooner or later, and when they do, there's a chance that they make the Family Hub a lot easier to use, but for now, they get an ""incomplete"" grade.

One problem is that we're starting to see voice-activated touchscreen gadgets like the Amazon Echo Show make their way into people's homes, which raises the bar for a dedicated display like the Family Hub's. Eventually, I suspect that it'll basically serve as a king-sized, Bixby-powered Echo Show for your kitchen, but we aren't there yet, and I wouldn't fault anybody who wanted to wait until we were before buying in.

That said, there are still some nice year-two refinements to the user interface. You'll find a few more apps, for instance, including a Nomiku app that can control smart sous vide gadgets. Samsung's existing apps are better-designed, too, with things like cartoonish avatars for each family member. They're also better-integrated with each other. For instance, after picking out something to cook from the Allrecipes app, you can select specific ingredients to add to your shopping list, or set timers specific to a particular part of the recipe.

Like the original Family Hub, you can open the camera feed and drag expiration timers over top of specific things in the fridge, but they won't live over top of that feed like before. Instead, they're relegated to a separate list. I'm not a fan of that change, as it puts those expiration reminders out of sight and out of mind, where they're less helpful.

There's also still no app for the Samsung-owned SmartThings connected home platform. The ability to toggle lights on and off or lock your door by tapping on the fridge might offer questionable utility at best, but it's still strange that Samsung hasn't done a better job of integrating its ecosystem by now.

Unlike last year's glamorous four-door models, the cheapest Family Hub fridge comes in a simple French door build with about 24 cubic feet of total storage space. It's still a few steps above entry level as far as French doors are concerned -- you get an in-door ice and water dispenser, as well as a temperature-adjustable ""Cool Select Pantry"" drawer and shelves that slide in and fold up to make room for tall items below. You can also get it in black stainless steel for an additional $100.

None of that is unique to this fridge (far from it), but it does make for a model that, on its own, would typically retail for somewhere between $1,600 and $2,000. That's before you factor in the touchscreen, the camera and the fridge apps. In other words, Samsung hit a strange sweet spot here -- cheap enough to bring the Family Hub's price way down, but still nice enough to call it a legitimate upgrade for most folks. In this case, the boring design is a feature, not a bug.

Still, it's fair to be disappointed if you were holding out for a design that's more refined. There's still the ""Ice Master"" ice maker eating up space on the top shelf -- and yes, there's still a much-too-narrow shelf in the door that we've affectionately dubbed the ""salsa moat."" In fairness to Samsung, both seem slightly less egregious than they were -- the Ice Master is a tad skinnier, while the salsa moat offers slightly more depth than before. They're both still design imperfections, but more annoyances than deal-breakers.

16.2 of the refrigerator's 24.2 cubic feet of total storage space are allocated to the fridge, which puts it on the small side of the French door spectrum. It's not a compact model by any stretch, but it might not be the best choice for a family of more than four or five.

The new Family Hub isn't as fancy as before, but it still offers decent performance for a fridge at this price range. During a week or so of non-stop performance tests in our appliances lab, it held accurate temperatures throughout the body of the fridge at both the default 37-degree setting and the coldest setting of 34 degrees.

It wasn't perfect, though. The bottom of the left door and the top of the right door both ran just slightly on the warm side, averaging temperatures above 40 degrees F at the default setting. That's pretty typical for a mid-range fridge like this, and not a real concern at all given that door shelves typically hold things like butter, beverages and preservative-heavy condiments. The temperatures in the body of the fridge are what really count.

The Cool Select Pantry drawer was more of a disappointment. It claims to offer three distinct temperature settings: 34, 38 and 41 degrees. The actual temperature range is much tighter, ranging from 34 to 37 degrees, and it also seemed susceptible to temperature changes in the body of the fridge surrounding it.

That's par for the course with temperature-adjustable drawers that live inside of the fridge itself, where it's quite a challenge to maintain a separate temperature. It's still useful if you want to soften up some cheese or get some soda a degree or two colder, but if precision is what you're after, you'll be better off looking for a model with a drawer that lives outside of the fridge itself.

The RF265BEAESR is designed to bring the Family Hub's touchscreen and grocery cameras into your kitchen at a much lower expense than before, and if you can catch it on sale, that's exactly what it offers. At $2,500 or less, you'll be spending a little less than you would on GE's coffee-making smart fridge and a lot less than you'll need to spend on the LG Smart InstaView fridge. You won't get last year's premium design, but you will get all of the same apps and smart features as before. Plus, the fridge is still a pretty decent performer, and nice enough to feel like you aren't compromising too much.

Samsung hasn't made the Family Hub a must-have yet, though. That might change as new software updates arrive, but for now, the touchscreen smarts amount to little more than a fun, semi-frivolous extra. If you're tempted, here's my advice: track one down at a department store and play around with the screen a bit. If it's still the sort of frivolous extra that strikes your fancy, then feel free to give it a shot. Worst case scenario: you'll pay a reasonable amount for a perfectly decent fridge with a touchscreen you won't use all that much."
Lifx Tile LED panels want to put an end to boring wall decor|"

September has been a busy month for smart lighting manufacturer Lifx. First it added Apple HomeKit compatibility to its line of smart LEDs, then it introduced three mini versions of its classic bulbs. Now Lifx is announcing Tile, a Nanoleaf-Aurora-esque color-changing LED wall panel.

Available for preorder now on the Lifx website, the Tile starter kit costs $250 for five wall panels and one US, Canadian or international power adapter. At the current exchange rate, Tile pricing converts to roughly £185 or AU$315. Lifx Tile kits will start shipping in November.

Here are the basics:

While Tile has an impressive list of smart home partners, the Lifx site doesn't explicitly mention any entertainment features for its new LED wall panels. Tile's main competitor, the Nanoleaf Aurora, announced the Aurora Rhythm in early September. Sold as a separate accessory for $50 (roughly £40 and AU$60 converted) or as part of the Aurora Smarter Rhythm Kit for $230 (£180/AU$290), the Aurora Rhythm lets you sync your Aurora LEDs to your favorite music.

Blossom Smart Watering Controller review:|"

The Blossom Smart Watering Controller is one of the best products I've ever tested that I don't recommend to anyone. If it was unique, I'd love it, as it competently provides a truly useful service. Blossom replaces your existing sprinkler controller and lets you control your sprinklers with your phone via the Blossom app. Better yet, Blossom monitors the weather and helps you schedule your sprinklers to avoid running them when it rains.

If you have an in-ground sprinkler system, I recommend investing in a smart sprinkler controller as it'll not only make your life easier, but it could also save you money over time by helping you conserve water. Even though it works well enough, I can't recommend the $150 Blossom Smart Watering Controller as you have better options. Both the $200 Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller and the $100 Orbit B-Hyve offer more advanced smarts and scheduling options than Blossom.

Blossom is hard to recommend mainly because it gets caught in the middle ground between the most budget-friendly smart sprinkler (B-Hyve) and the smartest (Rachio). Like the competition, Blossom connects to your home Wi-Fi network and works with the EPA WaterSense rebate program. If you're interested in a smart sprinkler, head here to see if you qualify for a rebate.

Unlike the competition, Blossom doesn't have anything that helps it stands out from an increasingly competitive smart sprinkler field. B-Hyve is appealing because of its price, and it has a great app that balances depth of options with ease of use. Rachio has a similarly great app and has the most scheduling flexibility of the field. It also works with the most other smart-home platforms so you can tie your sprinklers into your larger smart-home setup.

Blossom lets you schedule your sprinklers in relation to sunset or sunrise. Otherwise, it does what you'd expect and nothing more. That wasn't always the case. Blossom was one of the first smart sprinklers to hit the market, and it was initially priced and designed to compete directly with Rachio.

The original Blossom was $180 for 12 zones of control to undercut Rachio's $200 for eight or $250 for 16 zone system. Blossom was waterproof and Rachio wasn't. Blossom also supplemented Wi-Fi with power line networking. Essentially, if your sprinkler controller was located in a spot with a bad signal, Blossom could communicate with your router using the wiring in your home.

The startup behind the sprinkler controller -- also called Blossom -- later announced a cheaper model called the Blossom 8, which it offered in addition to the original as a $130 alternative if you didn't need power line communication or waterproofing.

Now, the original Blossom is no longer available. The Blossom 8 was redubbed the Blossom 7 (to reflect that you need to use a different type of connection for the eighth zone), then just Blossom again. The price has gone up to $150. It doesn't have power line networking and it's not waterproof. Ironically, Rachio now offers a waterproof case. Plus, Blossom isn't just competing with Rachio anymore, and the cheaper $100 B-Hyve includes a waterproof case as well.

Blossom still does plenty of things well. $150 isn't an unreasonable price, and if you can find it on sale, it's worth your consideration. You can buy Blossom on the company's site, or head to Amazon to look for a deal. Right now, it's only available in the US.

Installing Blossom is pretty easy -- you need to attach a wire for each of your zones and plug it in. If you can install a thermostat, you can install Blossom. You'll use the app to create an account and connect the controller to your Wi-Fi network, then the app walks you through the rest and sets up your zones.

You determine the schedule -- you can water on fixed days of the week, after an interval of days, or on odd or even days. You also tell Blossom what time you'd like watering to start on the days you choose. In addition to setting a specific time, you have the option to set your start time in relation to sunrise or sunset (so you can start your sprinklers an hour before sunrise, and Blossom will adapt the time each day based on when the sun will rise in your area).

Finally, you can decide how long you'd like your sprinklers to run each time, or you can turn on the sprinkler's smarts. If you pick the latter, you'll want to tell Blossom about each zone you're watering -- it asks you for the type of plant in the zone, the type of sprinkler you use, and whether the zone gets rainfall.

With smart scheduling, Blossom will determine how long to run the sprinklers based on your schedule and yard info, and it'll adapt your schedule based on local weather forecasts. You can turn push notifications on in the settings, too, so you'll know if Blossom is cancelling a watering session.

After you get your schedule set, you can also run the sprinkler manually if you want to add extra watering. The app makes it easy to hit a button and run a zone. You can also start your sprinklers with a voice command through Amazon's digital assistant Alexa or the Google Assistant.

Link your Blossom account to either your Alexa or Google account, then you can give a command to the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, respectively, to start or stop the sprinklers. You can't check the watering schedule or do anything advanced with your voice, but the basic voice controls worked well with both Amazon and Google.

Between its weather monitoring, its easy-to-use app and its compatibility with Alexa and the Google Assistant, Blossom gets enough of the basics right to be a good smart sprinkler. It's just lacking some of the extras and depth that make Rachio and B-Hyve great.

Unlike Rachio and B-Hyve, Blossom doesn't offer a fully smart schedule. You always need to tell Blossom what days you want to water, and it'll just use its weather info to skip days accordingly. Rachio and B-Hyve go one step beyond that, and offer a schedule option where they'll water only when your yard needs it.

Blossom also lacks middle ground. You can't set your own ideal watering duration and turn on weather monitoring smarts. B-Hyve doesn't have a middle ground between smart and dumb scheduling either, but Rachio has several options that mix your input with its smarts.

With Blossom, you have to turn on WaterSense as a mode in the settings. Rachio and B-Hyve just automatically comply with WaterSense regulations. Flip it on, and WaterSense mode will also ask you for soil type, slope and amount of shade for each zone and determine appropriate run times for you.

I don't know why WaterSense isn't turned on by default. Rachio and B-Hyve just fill in standard options for the extra questions if you don't provide the info. Rachio and B-Hyve also have a host of advanced settings that you can fine tune if you're an expert, and they allow you to attach rain and moisture sensors to your system so they can both know exactly when to water.

Both Rachio and B-Hyve have onboard controls, but Blossom doesn't. And Rachio and B-Hyve also have detailed calendars in their app that show watering and weather schedules. Blossom has a basic calendar showing your schedule, and a simple history showing when it has skipped watering, but no watering history, no detailed calendar with weather and watering info, and no water usage tracking.

B-Hyve's Alexa skill offers a lot of extra commands, and Rachio lets you pick your weather station for forecasts, and also works with a bunch of other smart home products such as Nest, IFTTT, Wink and SmartThings.

The Blossom Smart Watering Controller isn't a bad product or a broken product. It works, and if you still have an ordinary timer for your in-ground sprinklers, the $150 seven-zone Blossom would be a significant upgrade. I don't recommend it simply because it doesn't have an edge on the competition.

If price isn't an issue, go with the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller -- it's the smartest of the bunch and worth springing for, especially if you have other smart-home gear. If you do want a controller and want the most smarts for your money, go with the Orbit B-Hyve. Without a unique feature to call its own, Blossom wouldn't be my top choice for anyone, but it'll get the job done if you find it on sale."
Delta Leak Detector review:|"

Smart leak detectors have been around for years now, and we've tested a bunch of them. At $80, Delta's new Wi-Fi leak detector offers the solid functionality we've come to expect along with some additional user-friendly features. Is this leak detector a game-changing must-have? With its waterproofing issues and lack of smart home integrations, I have to say no.

Delta does start strong though, with a sleek, white disc design. This low-profile device isn't an eyesore and should fit in most utility closets and under-sink spaces without being intrusive. Two concentric rings of conductive metal monitor for the presence of unwanted moisture. A single button on the top of the device surrounded by an LED light ring acts as the main physical interface.

Beyond leak detection, Delta incorporates the ability to monitor temperature. Set the threshold for low and high temps in the app and you'll receive notifications if your space exceeds the limits. This could be especially helpful for cold winter nights when pipes could be at risk for freezing. The app also includes a log of timestamped temperature, leak and alert history.

Perhaps the biggest selling point of Delta's leak detector is the hub-free Wi-Fi connectivity. This detector connects to Wi-Fi through your mobile phone via the app, eliminating the need for a smart home hub. Removing the smart-hub middleman is a welcome feature, but it's not new. The Roost Smart Water Leak Detector, D-Link Wi-Fi Water Sensor and Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector all pull it off, too.

Setup is simple enough. Inside the box, you'll find the detector, a quick start guide and three AAA batteries, which Delta says will last about two years. Certain activities do require higher battery usage. Multiple leak alerts, a detector being offline for an extended period of time or a firmware update will drain the battery. Delta sends an alert to change the batteries once they reach 20 percent. You can also view the battery life percentage and signal strength at any time in the app.

To get started, you'll download the Delta Leak Detector app from the App Store or from the Google Play Store and create a profile. On-screen instructions will help you configure your device. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi must be functioning on your mobile device to complete setup. The leak detector is not compatible with 5GHz Wi-Fi and won't show those networks in the available Wi-Fi options.

The detector's ability to independently connect to your home's Wi-Fi without going through a smart hub is a plus. It simplifies setup and presumably means fewer connectivity issues. However, if the power goes out, in most cases your Wi-Fi will too, and the device won't be able to send you notifications.

You can name the detector for the appliance you'd like to monitor. There's plenty of opportunity for customization here. Choose from a list of common leaky appliances (think ""sump pump,"" ""sink,"" ""toilet"" or ""water heater"") or create your own device name using the ""Other"" category.

Delta includes the option to add multiple users for SMS and email alerts. I like this feature for extra insurance, in case I'm out of town or otherwise not able to respond to a leak notification.

In addition to mobile alerts, the device also beeps and flashes its center LED when it detects a problem. Placed in a high-traffic area like under a kitchen sink or behind a toilet, this is a welcome back-up notification system. The beeps and flashes last about 10 seconds and occur every 30 seconds for three repetitions. However, if the detector were in a utility room or closet I doubt anyone would notice, as the beeping isn't very loud and doesn't last very long.

I tested water both above and around the device with success. With the detector sitting directly beneath one of my fake leaks, it took around 10 droplets for the water to roll down the device's edge and contact the metal rings. This is where I think Delta gets it right, by adding the ability to detect leaks before real pooling or flooding begins.

There are some caveats to using this device for water sensing, though. First, Delta states in the user guide that the device is not designed for complete submersion. Delta does say the battery cover is designed to be tight enough to keep water out, but it also recommends replacing the device entirely if water reaches the battery compartment. For me, that's hard to swallow considering the $80 price tag. Last year's Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector debuted with the same annoying issue.

Second, this leak detector lacks meaningful smart-home integrations. Though it was developed with iDevices, don't be fooled. Delta's leak detector doesn't integrate with major voice-assistant platforms like Apple's Homekit, Google Home or Amazon's Alexa. Delta uses iDevices technology for Wi-Fi pairing, but you're completely dependent on the standalone Delta Leak Detector app for controls and notifications.

Delta's leak detector is set to enter the market this fall at $80, making it one of the more expensive smart leak detectors available. While it does offer easy setup, a companion app with good customization options and a sleek design, the price tag seems high.

This leak detector seems squarely aimed at competing with the similarly priced Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector. But for the same money, Honeywell offers a cable to extend detection range, IFTTT compatibility and humidity measuring.

That leaves Delta's Leak Detector as a visually attractive but pricey alternative. It comes with quite a few useful features, but it isn't without its waterproofing flaws. It is currently available for preorder, with a release date set for October 12."
Lifx unveils three new Mini smart bulbs that work with Siri|"

Hot on the heels of its announcement Thursday that Lifx current-gen bulbs now support Apple HomeKit, Lifx is preparing to take orders on its next generation of color-changing smart LEDs.

It's called Lifx Mini, and it comes in three varieties: a fully color-changing bulb for $45, a color-tunable, white light bulb for $30, and a fixed white light bulb at 2,700K for $25.

As the name suggests, each Mini bulb sports a slightly more compact design than before, but still puts out a healthy 800 lumens of light at peak brightness, which is roughly comparable to a 60W incandescent despite only drawing 9W each. The previous generation of Lifx bulbs put out a much more ample 1,100 lumens -- Lifx plans to continue making and selling them at a price of $60 each for customers willing to spend a little more for some extra brightness (that's about £45 or AU$75).

The Lifx Plus bulbs, which add in infrared night vision diodes to help light things up for your security cameras at night, aren't going anywhere, either.

Like those existing Lifx bulbs, the Mini LEDs each house their own Wi-Fi radio, allowing them to connect directly with your home network. That means that you can control them from anywhere that has an internet connection, and it also means that you don't need a special hub to translate their signal.

That last bit is the biggest differentiator between Lifx and its top competitor, Philips Hue, and it doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon.

The new Mini bulbs also enjoy all of the existing Lifx integrations with third-party services, including the newly released support for Apple HomeKit. That means you can control them alongside other HomeKit-compatible devices using the Home app on iOS devices. It also means that you can dim them up and down or change their color using a Siri command. Beyond HomeKit, Lifx bulbs also work with Amazon's Alexa, the Google Home smart speaker, IFTTT, Logitech Harmony and more.

With the Mini bulbs, Lifx is promising a wider distribution of light than with previous generations. Those older bulbs sport a flat-topped design that puts out plenty of light above the bulb, but not quite as much down below it. The Mini bulbs should do a little bit better in that regard, but with less brightness overall, the difference might be negligible.

I'm also a bit skeptical of the beam angle improvement, seeing as how the Mini LED's bulb doesn't extend out any further than its base. I'm nitpicking, but that's the same general problem with the previous generation's design.

My other qualm here is the price. $45 is still an awful lot to spend on a smart bulb, even one that changes colors. Still, that's pretty much par for the course with color-changers like these. The also-HomeKit-compliant Sylvania Smart LED costs $45 a piece, too, while Philips Hue LEDs each cost $50. Even the typically budget-minded TP-Link sells its own color-changing smart bulb for $50.

It's hard to fault Lifx for being expensive when everyone's expensive, and in fairness, the $45 Lifx Mini is the brand's most affordable color-changer yet. Still, there's a huge opening for a more value-minded alternative to emerge. It's a shame Lifx wouldn't or couldn't go there with its fourth generation of bulbs -- and a shame that it wasn't able to drop the price without dropping the brightness, too.

The price of the $25 fixed, white-light Mini is even more telling. Names like Cree, GE and Philips Hue have long been selling white-light-only bulbs for $15 each, or less. With competitors like those, it's the toughest of the three Minis to recommend.

Lifx will begin accepting preorders on all three of the new Mini bulbs starting Friday. As soon as we get our hands on a few, expect full reviews out of the CNET Smart Home."
Cree 100W Replacement BR30 Floodlight LED review:|"

If your home has high ceilings, first off, congratulations on your palace. Second, you might need some extra oomph in your light bulbs since they're up so high. Thing is, if you're looking for BR30-shaped LED floodlights, most options in the lighting aisle won't come much brighter than 700 lumens -- bright enough for normal use, but probably dimmer than what you're looking for.

That's where Cree's newest LED light bulb comes in. At an asking price of $11 per bulb, it's a 100W replacement floodlight that puts out 1,500 lumens, which is just about as bright as BR30-shaped bulbs get.

Like most LEDs, it's efficient, too, with an actual power draw of just 16.5W. Use it to replace a 100W incandescent floodlight that you use for an average of three hours a day, and you'll knock about $10 off of your yearly power bill. In other words, it'll pay for itself in just over a year of use.

After that, it'll keep saving you money for decades thanks to the 22.8-year lifespan. Cree backs that up with an industry-leading 10-year warranty.

From the looks of it, Cree got just about everything right with this bulb. Not only is it bright and efficient, but it also dims exceedingly well, showing absolutely no visible flicker with any of the switches I used in testing.

Cree tells me that it worked in conjunction with Lutron and Leviton, two of the leading manufacturers of dimmer switches, to make sure that the bulb aced the in-house certification tests of both brands before bringing it to market. Sure enough, the dimming performance was virtually identical on modern dimmer switches from each brand, dialing down to a satisfying minimum of 7 percent on each. The only real disappointment was that the bulb only dimmed down to 18 percent on an old rotary-style dimmer.

It also aced my thermal management tests in which I measure how far the brightness dips as the bulb heats up during prolonged use. Most LED bulbs will see their initial brightness fall by anywhere from 10 to 20 percent in the first 45 minutes of use before the heat sinks really kick in and level things out. Cree claims that it beefed up the thermal management capabilities for this bulb, and the company wasn't kidding -- the initial brightness only dropped by about 3 percent in my test. That's an outstanding result, and reassuring if you need to use this bulb in an enclosed fixture where the heat gets trapped.

The bulb's final selling point is that it boasts a color rendering score in the low 90s, which is very good; most LEDs score in the mid-80s at best. Bulbs with higher scores on the color rendering index (CRI) will do a better job of making the colors in your home pop -- whiter whites, more vivid reds and so on. Cree made color rendering a focal point for its entire lineup in 2016, and its bulbs do produce noticeably better colors and cleaner whites than the average LED.

This is a very good bulb with no real weaknesses, and the price is right at $11. Consider that most dimmable 65W replacement floodlight LEDs sell for about $7. Paying a couple of extra bucks for almost twice as much brightness seems fair to me, especially for a bulb that performs as well as this one does."
Fabriq joins the Chorus of voice-activated Alexa speakers|"

A little over half a year after it released a fabric-covered, Alexa-enabled alternative to Amazon's Echo Dot mini-speaker, Fabriq is back -- this time with a new Alexa speaker called the Chorus.

At $99, the Chorus is basically an off-brand Amazon Tap, and it offers a couple of key upgrades over the original Fabriq speaker (now known as the Riff). Like the Tap, the Chorus houses an internal battery that lets you pick it up from the charging cradle and take it with you for up to six hours of portable playback. With a larger, more powerful speaker than before, the Chorus is also better at filling a room with sound. Where the Riff requires you to push a button to activate Alexa, you can activate the Chorus with just your voice.

The Chorus compares well against the Tap, too. Not only is it $30 less expensive, it also comes in an attractive variety of colors and designs -- four options here at launch, with more promised in the coming months. On top of that, Fabriq's app lets you link multiple Chorus and Riff speakers together over the air for wireless, synchronized playback -- a neat trick that the Tap doesn't offer.

The Tap's trump card, however, might be Amazon's ESP feature, which makes it so that only the Alexa device closest to you will respond to your command. We haven't seen any third-party Alexa gadgets with ESP, the Chorus included. That's a shame, since ESP is all but mandatory if you're planning to fill your home with multiple Alexa devices.

Aside from that, the Chorus offers the same Alexa experience as you'd get with the Tap. You wake it up by saying ""Alexa,"" then follow that up with a question or command. With Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios inside, you can ask to stream music and podcasts from services like Spotify, TuneIn, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and Amazon Music, or just stream audio straight from your phone or tablet.

Alexa also offers traffic updates, kitchen timers, ""flash briefings"" of the day's news headlines, control of a wide variety of smart home gadgets, and access to a growing library of over 20,000 free ""skills"" that each teach Alexa new tricks when you enable them.

As for audio quality, the Chorus sounded pretty good to my ear during a non-scientific test run in the CNET Smart Home. It isn't as full-sounding as the Amazon Echo or Echo Show, but it's definitely a clear step up from the Riff, and more or less on par with the Amazon Tap.

You can also use any Alexa device to start playback on any other, including the Chorus. For instance, I placed a Chorus on the side table next to the front door and named it ""Front Door."" Then, I asked the Echo in the kitchen to ""play jazz music at the front door."" It worked perfectly.

However, you can't use the Chorus to make a voice call to other Alexa devices, but then again, neither can the Tap. That calling and messaging feature is reserved for the Echo, the Echo Dot, the Echo Show and the Alexa app.

The Chorus is available starting today on Fabriq's website, on Target.com, and on Amazon. We'll keep testing it out, along with all of the other new third-party Alexa gadgets we're seeing this year. Plan on seeing our picks for the best of the bunch in time for the holiday buying season.

C by GE Sol Smart Lamp with Amazon Alexa review:|"

""Sol"" is the sun-inspired name of GE's long-awaited Alexa lamp. It's basically just a smallish Amazon Echo smart speaker with a big honkin' halo growing out of its head instead of the usual indicator lights. It's available on Amazon, and costs $200.

So, ask yourself: If the $180 Amazon Echo sat beneath a Dysonesque ring of light, would you pay an extra $20 for it?

I have a hard time faulting anybody who says yes. After all, using Alexa to turn lights on and off is one of the virtual voice assistant's most popular features, and the Sol puts the experience into a singular package. Plus, that highly visible ring of light lets GE offer visual indicators for things like Alexa's kitchen timers and the time of day. The Sol gives Alexa one or two new tricks that you won't get with the Echo.

It can't make calls to other Alexa users, though -- for that, you'll need the Echo, the smaller Echo Dot or the touchscreen-equipped Echo Show. More importantly, it lacks Amazon's ESP feature, which makes sure only the Alexa device closest to you responds to your commands. That's a shame -- ESP is all but mandatory if you plan on placing lots of Alexa devices throughout your home. Amazon declined to respond when asked whether or not third-party Alexa devices like the Sol should expect to be able to add ESP in the future via software update.

Still, if you're just looking to bring Alexa into something like a bedroom or office, and you're willing to splurge a bit for something you'll like looking at, then the Sol fits the bill. I like it a lot more than I thought I would.

The Sol is a neat-looking lamp, and roughly the diameter of a basketball at 13 inches wide. It features two rings of light: an exterior ring for the LED lamp, and an interior ring for the familiar, blue glow that indicates Alexa is listening.

That interior ring works just like the ring of light on the top of the Amazon Echo -- it lights up whenever you say ""Alexa"" and glows red whenever you have her on mute. It also lets Alexa offer visual indicators. As of now, the two that GE offers are a pair of lights that you can turn on to indicate the time (red for the hour, blue for the minute), along with a shrinking ring of light that shows you how much time is left on any timers you've asked Alexa to set.

To get started, you plug the Sol in and sync with it using the C by GE app on your Android or iOS device. From there, you pair the lamp with your Wi-Fi network and enter your Amazon login credentials to enable Alexa.

The Sol works just like you'd expect from an Alexa device, and aside from calling other Alexa users, it can do anything the Amazon Echo can do. That includes music streaming and news briefings, making shopping lists and telling bad jokes. You also get access to Alexa's ever-growing library of ""skills,"" a free collection of extra tricks you can enable that now number well over 20,000.

The first one of those skills you should enable is the ""CbyGE"" skill, because you'll need it in order to control the Sol's light output using voice commands. Once it's enabled, you can ask Alexa to turn your Sol on and off, dim it up and down or change its color temperature from an orangey, soft white to a stark white daylight tone. There are also touch buttons on the top of the lamp's base to adjust the brightness and volume, and to turn it on and off.

You can also do all of that using the app, along with a couple of other tricks. Beyond turning those clock and timer indicators on and off, you can also group the Sol with other C by GE lighting products to control multiple lights at once or schedule lighting changes for specific times of day. That includes color temperature-shifting ""scene"" changes, as well as timed fades to help ease you out of bed in the morning.

I think I do -- or I at least love the idea of lamp. As I said up at the top, lighting control is one of Alexa's coolest capabilities, so packing her directly into a lighting fixture makes for a surprisingly compelling combo.

On top of that, the Sol's sound quality was better than I expected: not quite as good as the Amazon Echo, but close, and right about on par with the midrange Amazon Tap. It won't please audiophiles, but it's perfect for casual listeners, or anyone who just wants to listen to a chapter in their audiobook before bed.

Reading under it might be a different story, though, because the Sol isn't as bright as most lamps. GE doesn't offer an official lumen count for the lamp, but to my eye, it's nowhere near as bright as a 60W incandescent bulb. Think of it more as an accent light than a primary light source.

My biggest complaint, however, is that it doesn't feel like the premium device that its price suggests. The plastic build and the sparse, hard-to-read design of the touch buttons err on the cheap side of minimalism. The rings of light aren't diffused quite enough to keep you from seeing the individual diodes inside, which emphasizes the artificial quality of the light. It's pretty, but it isn't perfect.

I also think GE missed an opportunity to pack color-changing diodes into the lamp, and make the Sol something of a standalone Philips Hue competitor. Alexa is fully capable of controlling color-changing lights like those, and GE already took advantage of that fact by letting her change the lamp's color temperature.

Why stop there, though? Adding in a full array of colors would have been a nice complement to the lamp's already unique design, as well as a smart way to help GE justify its expense. The Sol could have also been a good opportunity for GE to finally insert itself into the color-changing category, where it has long lagged. Instead, the opportunity is missed.

Nah, probably not. Consider that a nearly identical lamp without the Alexa smarts is currently marked down to $40 on Amazon. Even if you take that lamp at its inflated suggested retail price of $100, that's still only half a Sol. Are the speaker and Alexa smarts really worth another $100 when you can get an Echo Dot for less than $50?

Make no mistake, the Sol isn't priced at a value -- it's priced like the first-of-its-kind product that it is. There is no other big-name Alexa lamp to speak of at the moment, which gives GE leverage to charge a premium. That would have been more forgivable had GE given it fully color-changing light or a less plasticky build -- instead, people who want it will have to pay a little more than they probably should. Capitalism!

Still, the Sol is an unexpectedly good idea that's executed fairly well, which is more than I can say about a lot of products that ask for a place in the smart home. If you want a Sol, feel free to splurge on it, but I'd recommend waiting to see if its price comes down at all -- or if other Alexa-friendly lighting manufacturers like Philips, Lifx or Sylvania ultimately try to eclipse it with a lamp of their own."
Wiz Color Wi-Fi Smart LED Starter Kit review:|"

Editor's Note, 5:15 PM EST, 9/15/17: This review originally claimed in error that the Wiz LEDs did not have a white-light setting brighter than 450 lumens. In actuality, there's a 4,200 K setting that reaches 807 lumens, roughly on par with a 60W replacement incandescent. The review text has been updated accordingly, and the score has changed from a 6.2 to a 6.9.

Take a walk through your local lighting aisle and you'll find plenty of good LED options for $5 or less. Color-changing smart bulbs, on the other hand, are still pretty expensive -- big-name options like Lifx and Philips Hue typically charge about $50 per bulb.

In that sense, the Wiz LEDs are a slight step in the right direction. For $70, you get two color-changing smart bulbs, plus a handy physical remote for quick adjustments. Like their more expensive competitors, the Wiz LEDs work with Alexa and with the Google Home smart speaker for voice commands, and they have their own channel on the free online automation service IFTTT, too. With Wi-Fi inside, they don't need a hub to talk to your router -- just screw them in, turn them on, and sync up with them on your phone using the Wiz app.

The problem here is that the bulbs aren't as bright as advertised, at least not at the white-light settings you'd expect. Wiz pegs the light output of each bulb at 800 lumens -- about as bright as a standard 60W incandescent bulb -- but in my own tests, the two ends of the white light spectrum (2,700 K and 6,500 K) wouldn't go any higher than 450 lumens. You have to go with a 4,200 K ""daylight"" setting in the middle of that spectrum in order to hit 800 lumens.

As for the colors, they're all fairly accurate, but none of them go any brighter than 200 lumens.

If you can look past that shortcoming, you'll find a fairly decent control app that lets you change the color of the bulbs or style them using a number of preset themes, including color cycles with custom speed settings. You can also make a quick color scheme by taking a picture, group the bubs by room or schedule the bulbs to turn off and on at specific times.

Unlike Lifx or Hue, the Wiz LEDs also come with a physical remote. On it, you'll find off and on buttons along with dimming controls and four customizable presets. In the app, you can pick what each of those preset buttons does for each individual bulb you point it at. Preset No. 4 could be the party lighting setting for one bulb and the nightlight setting for the other.

The remote is a nice differentiator, but it was a pain to use, and it was unreliable from anything more than a few feet away from the bulb. Even up close, there were times where I'd need to press a button multiple times from a variety of different angles before the signal would register with the bulb. Controlling multiple bulbs at once is technically possible, but I was only able to get it to work once or twice during my tests.

Dimming the bulbs up and down was slow and stuttery, with visible ""bumps"" from one brightness setting to the next. Compared with other smart lighting remotes I've tested from names like TCP and Haiku, this one was far too finicky to recommend -- though Wiz tells me that they're working on a firmware fix that should be ready within weeks.

Syncing with Alexa and the Google Assistant for voice controls was a lot easier. With Alexa, the Wiz app actually offers two skills: one for basic on/off and dimming controls, and an ""advanced"" version that also lets you trigger color cycles. The rub is that the advanced skill requires you to tack ""my Wiz"" onto your command, as in, ""Alexa, tell my Wiz to change the reading lamp to the Party light setting."" At any rate, you'll enable either one with just a few taps in the Alexa app.

There are a few problems here, though. First, neither skill actually lets you change the color of your bulbs (again, Wiz tells me that a fix is planned for the near future). This is odd enough with the basic skill, given that Alexa added native support for color-changing bulbs months ago, but even the advanced skill can't handle them. Say, ""Alexa, tell my Wiz to change the reading lamp to blue,"" and she'll tell you she doesn't know a light setting called ""blue."" You have to use presets like ""Christmas,"" ""Ocean"" and ""Fireplace.""

Even worse, those advanced preset controls didn't work very well. I had to be very precise with my wording for Alexa to understand what I was talking about, and even then, they sometimes fired off in unexpected ways. Changing one lamp to the Party setting would end up changing all of my lamps to the Party setting, for instance. In another case, I asked for the red and green ""Christmas"" setting, and somehow got the green and white ""Mojito"" setting instead. No idea how that happened.

On the Google Home front, things are a little simpler. After adding your bulbs in the Google Home app, you'll be able to tell the Google Assistant to turn the lights on and off or change their colors -- no ""tell my Wiz"" necessary. The downside is that you can't trigger any of those preset color cycles.

If you're interested in color-changing smart bulbs but put off by the high cost of buying in, then you might consider saving a few bucks by going with Wiz. I'd advise against it, though. Whether by voice or by remote, the controls are too clunky, and the bulbs aren't as bright as the competition.

My recommendation: Stick with my top smart lighting pick, the non-color-changing Philips Hue White LED starter kit (you can always add a color-changing bulb or two later on down the line). If you'd rather splurge on color-changing light from the get-go, then consider Lifx, which offers the best brightness and color quality, and the best app, too. Both options work well with Alexa, Google Home, IFTTT and a lot more. In my opinion, each is well worth the extra cash."
This solar security cam brings face recognition to your yard|"

Tend Secure, the startup behind the Lynx indoor camera is back with a new product -- the $200 Lynx Solar outdoor camera. Available for pre-order now at the reduced price of $150, the Lynx Solar is expected to start shipping in late October.

Here's an overview of the Lynx Solar's features:

Tend Secure says its solar panel accessory can power a Lynx Solar cam for up to 7 days (when fully charged).

I'm intrigued that the Lynx Solar has facial recognition, considering that shadows, sunglasses, hats and any other common outdoor accoutrements can seriously limit visibility and make it difficult both to detect and distinguish among faces.

So far, the outdoor ""facial recognition"" cameras I've tested, like Netatmo's Presence, haven't actually been able to distinguish among a stored personal database of faces. Instead, they're only able to tell you that they saw a person. We'll just have to try out the Lynx Solar for ourselves and report back.

Nest Thermostat E review:|"

I've literally waited years for a more affordable Nest -- and it's finally here in the form of the $169 Thermostat E. At 80 bucks less than Nest's premium Learning Thermostat, the E excels in its simplicity.

It sports plastic components, fewer wire terminals and a lower-res screen. Because of the display's limitations, you also won't find Farsight on the E, a feature that displays custom info such as an analog clock or the current weather forecast from a distance. Otherwise, the E does all of the same things as the Learning Thermostat. It will auto-adjust your heat and AC based on whether or not you're home and give you the same remote access from the Nest app. You can even enlist Amazon's Alexa speakers or the Google Home to adjust the temperature for you.

But aside from its more minimal off-white design, the Thermostat E doesn't do anything new or innovative. You still won't find a remote temperature sensor or compatibility with Apple's Siri voice control platform, HomeKit.

Even so, the Thermostat E is a welcome, long-awaited addition to Nest's product roster. It's particularly worth your consideration if you like Nest, but don't want to spend $249 on a single thermostat.

Back when thermostats were largely considered utilitarian home necessities (2011), Nest introduced its original Learning Thermostat. Suddenly, folks were lining up to spend $249 on Nest's smart heating and cooling device. It wasn't the first app-enabled thermostat ever sold, but its unique rounded design and integrated tech struck a chord with consumers.

Before long, Honeywell, Ecobee and other manufacturers introduced smart thermostats in the same price range. But while Nest was busy working on second- and third-gen versions of the same $249 thermostat, its competitors were rounding out their lineups with new and less expensive smart thermostats.

The $169 Thermostat E matters because Nest is finally offering a more affordable product. (UK and Australian prices have yet to be announced, but that converts to about £130 or AU$210.) At 80 bucks less than its flagship model, the E also has almost all of the same smart functions:

Nest's E also has a similar rounded design, but this iteration is more minimal. It has plastic, rather than metal hardware components and a lower-res screen that doesn't support Nest's Farsight feature. Nest was going for a watercolor effect with the Thermostat E, so its screen has a ""frosted,"" almost blurred look. It's not great for viewing from a distance if you have less-than-perfect vision.

The E has only six wire terminals as well, so it won't work with quite as many HVAC systems as Nest's 10-terminal Learning Thermostat. The idea is that the E is the simpler model, the one you'd chose for a basic home setup, whereas the Learning Thermostat is the grown-up option that one you'd buy for more complicated HVAC systems.

Compatibility with Amazon's Alexa speakers and the Google HomeSensors and your phone's location help let the E know if you're home Pairs with the same Nest mobile app for Android and iPhone

"" data-image-credit=""Screenshot by CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""nest-thermostat-e"" data-image-filename=""nest-thermostat-e.png"" data-image-date-created=""2017/09/11"" data-image-width=""640"" data-image-height=""1136"" data-image-do-not-crop=""false"" data-image-do-not-resize=""false"" data-image-watermark=""false"" data-lightbox=""enabled"">

If the Thermostat E didn't look slightly different from the Learning Thermostat and leave out the Farsight feature, I would have barely known I was testing a different product.

Everything, from the auto-adjusting heating and cooling schedule to the app control worked in much the same way.

The auto-adjusting schedule is Nest's way of saying it will rely on the thermostat's built-in sensors, as well as your and your family's phone locations to determine if anyone's home. If it senses that everyone is out, it will switch the temperature to an energy-saving mode. You can still set ranges, though, to make sure the temperatures never reach extremes in the warmest and coldest months.

You can also manually override these settings whenever you want by adjusting the thermostat, using the app or with voice commands. For voice commands, you'll need an Amazon Alexa speaker or the Google Home.

The installation is familiar too. You don't need a C-wire to run the E and the app guides you through the entire setup process. The Nest website can tell you whether your HVAC system is compatible with the Thermostat E.

Note: Contact a professional if you have questions about your HVAC system and the installation process.

Since we already had a Nest account for the CNET Smart Home, as well as perfectly-Nest-thermostat-sized holes drilled in our thermostat testing area, the installation took only 10 minutes. It'll take longer if you need to create a new Nest account, drill new holes or paint or patch areas the previous thermostat used to cover. The first step, though, is always to shut off power to your thermostat at the circuit breaker.

Nest's Thermostat E is a late but welcome addition to the smart thermostat market. You get a lot for your $169, too, including auto-adjusting scheduling and remote access via the app, Alexa and the Google Assistant.

You also get a pared-down, arguably improved design. No, the lighter plastic hardware doesn't feel as substantial, but I personally prefer the look of the minimal, off-white E. It's more likely to blend in with your wall, but it also manages to avoid the boring, white plastic aesthetic you find with so many standard thermostats.

But the E isn't perfect. To reduce its price to $169, Nest opted for a lower-res screen, scrapped Farsight and dropped the number of available wire terminals. If any of those things give you pause, but you want to spend less than 200 bucks, look to the Ecobee3 Lite or the Honeywell Lyric T5."
iHome's new alarm clock wants you to wake up with Alexa|"

iHome makes an awful lot of alarm clocks, including Alexa-friendly models designed to house an Amazon Echo Dot. Now, iHome's latest bedside gadget takes that approach one step further, packing voice-activated Alexa access directly into the clock itself -- no Dot necessary.

That clock is the iAVS16, and with far-field microphones that can hear you from across the room and Amazon's Alexa Voice Services programmed inside, it can do just about everything that Amazon's Echo line of smart speakers can do. You can ask for the weather forecast, control your smart home gadgets, stream music, or access any one of Alexa's more-than-20,000 free voice skills.

The cost? $150 -- a fairly steep premium for what iHome is calling the first voice-activated Alexa clock of its kind from a major brand.

In addition to the Alexa smarts, the iAVS16 offers LED mood lighting, a 10-watt internal amplifier for music playback, Bluetooth streaming support, an integrated speakerphone with digital echo cancellation and a 2.1A USB port for charging your devices while you sleep.

The iAVS16 has no internal alarm, and instead, relies entirely on Amazon's Alexa-powered alarm functionality. That means you'll need to ask Alexa to set the alarm instead of button-mashing like in olden days -- though, thankfully, the snooze button still works as an alternative to grumbling at Alexa to shut the heck up each morning.

The iAVS16 reflects the fact that a growing number of manufacturers see Alexa's popularity as a rising tide capable of lifting their boat. Though it's the first time iHome has programmed Alexa directly into a device, this isn't the iHome team's first Alexa-friendly gadget. In addition to the Echo Dot alarm clock, the brand also offers automatable smart plugs that work with Alexa -- and you'll find all of them for sale on Amazon.

""This year, iHome has focused on growing its Alexa smart home offerings and integrating artificial intelligence technologies into products across all categories, including smart plugs,"" said Gary Schultz, director of product and business development at iHome.

To that end, you can use iHome's app to program two of the clock's buttons -- the square and the triangle -- to toggle your iHome Plugs on and off. They'll work with any other Alexa-compatible plug, too. If plugs aren't your fancy, you can program those buttons to launch music stations and playlists.

A third programmable button, marked with a star, can be programmed to trigger wake and sleep home control. Press when you wake up to turn on your lights and music all at once, or press before bed to turn everything off.

We've already seen third parties pack Alexa into a lamp, a TV, a refrigerator, a thermostat and a growing range of smart speaker alternatives to the Echo. It's actually surprising that it's taken this long to get her into a clock, given the Echo Dot's established bedside appeal.

Still, $150 is obviously an awful lot of money for an alarm clock, and considerably more than than what you'd spend on iHome's Echo Dot clock dock and an Echo Dot to go with it. The Beddi smart alarm clock costs a lot less, too -- it doesn't feature Alexa or any other voice assistant packed inside, but it does offer a whole host of smart home integrations capable of toggling your lights or adjusting your thermostat with the touch of a button.

The iAVS16 is expected to hit retail outlets and Amazon in October. We'll test it out and tell you what we think in the coming weeks."
Panasonic's laundry machine concept does all the work for you|"

A concept machine from Panasonic makes a big promise to complete every step of laundry -- from sorting to folding and everything in between.

Panasonic displayed the appliance, called the Sustainable Maintainer, at the IFA 2017 trade show in Berlin. Here's how it worked during a demonstration:

The Sustainable Maintainer is just a concept, so it's not clear whether it will ever make its way into stores. But it shows that Panasonic, like many other companies at IFA 2017, has a growing concern for clothing care.

Find out what else is happening at IFA 2017.

You place clothes inside the machine.Grabbers lift each garment, and the machine scans it in search of stains and product care information.The machine lays the garment flat and sends it across a conveyor belt. The machine finds the previously identified stains and washes only those.The machine sucks the clothing dry, then grabs the garment and folds it."
LG's robot mower uses GPS to keep your grass cut|"

LG wants to take the aches and pains out of lawn care by letting you control its latest smart mower with your voice. The manufacturer's LG Lawn Mower Robot will work with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, the virtual assistants that you can cue with your voice. That means you should be able to say, ""Alexa, cut my grass"" or ""OK, Google, mow the lawn"" to your Alexa- or Google Assistant-enabled smart speaker when the grass is too long, and the Lawn Mower Robot will automatically do its thing.

LG showed off the Lawn Mower Robot Thursday at the IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin. The company first announced the mower at the CES 2017 consumer electronics show, but it made more details available this week:

But there's still a lot we don't know about the Lawn Mower Robot. LG didn't release information about when it will be available, in which countries you can buy it or how much the mower will cost. It's sure to be expensive -- robot lawnmowers tend to start at about $1,000 (about £775 or AU$1,260) and increase from there depending on how large your yard is.

Whenever the Lawn Mower Robot becomes available, it does seem to have some advantages over similar gadgets, such as the $1,600 Robomow RS612 we reviewed last year. Integration with virtual assistants is cool, and the built-in GPS adds some security to robot lawnmowers since you're supposed to leave them outside rather than locked away.

Click here to find out what else is happening at IFA, Europe's largest tech conference.

Along with integration with Amazon and Google, LG equipped the boxy mower with GPS tracking that collects data about where it needs to go in your yard. That GPS will also let you know where your Lawn Mower Robot is if someone steals it from your lawn.You have to install a perimeter wire around your yard so the robot mower knows where to stop mowing.The mower takes 30 minutes to fully charge.It can mow 5,500 square feet in 2.5 hours."
Lenovo's Home Assistant dock adds Alexa to your Tab 4 tablet|"

Alexa has already broken free of Amazon's branded Echo speakers, and you can find the smart assistant in new or coming-soon devices such as the Triby radio, Lenovo Smart Assistant and LG InstaView.

Now Lenovo adds another compatible device to the list with the Home Assistant Pack, which connects Lenovo Tab 4 tablets (8-inch or 10-inch) to an Echo-like speaker. When docked, by sliding the tablet into a groove on the side of the speaker, the tablet screen becomes a status window for Alexa. It's similar to, but not as in-depth as what you see on the Echo Show.

The cylindrical 3-watt speaker includes two far-field microphones (versus seven in Amazon's original Echo) and listens for the familiar ""Alexa"" wake-up command. In a brief hands-on test, the speaker responded well to Alexa voice commands, including playing music, offering a weather report, answering questions and streaming a radio station. Audio quality via the built-in 3-watt speaker was better suited to news than music.

The visuals are provided by a custom Lenovo app, which needs to be downloaded to the Tab 4 tablet (we haven't had a chance to test it yet, but Lenovo says the app-and-dock combo will only work for Tab 4 tablets).

Asking for the weather put a basic weather report up on the screen, and it shows the title and artist when playing songs. But there were no read-along lyrics or TV and movie playback, as on the Echo Show.

Even though it's lacking some of the features of the $229 Echo Show, the Lenovo Home Assistant has a much more reasonable price. It'll be $69 in the US when it's released in October, plus the cost of a Tab 4 tablet, around $150. Pricing and availability for other regions is still be announced, but the Assistant roughly converts to £50 or AU$85."
Qihan's helper robot only has eyes for your smart home|"

Helper robots are becoming a thing and Qihan's cute Sanbot Nano is the latest iteration, announced at Europe's largest tech conference. The Sanbot Nano will be available for purchase in October for a cool $2,800 in the United States. That price converts to roughly £2,170 and AU$3,530 at the current exchange rate.

In addition to its friendly disposition, the always-smiling Sanbot Nano is also outfitted with a ton of tech.

Standing at 2.7 feet tall, this helper bot has over 50 sensors designed to help it navigate, keep an eye on your home and even control your connected devices. Qihan specifically mentions upcoming support for ""the world's most popular connected home brands"" in lighting, thermostats and appliances.

As far as surveillance goes, Qihan's Q-Link app gives you access to a live video stream of whatever the Sanbot Nano sees, as well as the ability to control the bot remotely anywhere you have internet access. The robot's object detection sensors are supposed to help it watch over the house and sound an alarm if unexpected activity takes place.

We've seen our fair share of bots like the Sanbot Nano within the last year -- LG's Hub Robot, Mayfield Robotics' Kuri and Ubitech Lynx immediately come to mind. Like the LG Hub and the Ubitech Lynx, Qihan says the Sanbot Nano will work with Amazon Alexa.

So what separates the Sanbot from the rest of the bunch? For starters, LG's Hub Robot and many other helper bots are still just neat concepts that you can't find in stores. That isn't so with Sanbot; Qihan expects to launch a retail version of its Sanbot Nano this October. Obviously, we really want to test one out at the CNET Smart Home.

Haier's touchscreen fridge can see your food, recommend a recipe|"

Haier's Link Cook Series refrigerators are one step closer to answering the question, ""What's for dinner?"" Haier has equipped four-door refrigerators with built-in cameras that let you see your food, and software that will let the refrigerators suggest recipes based on its contents, Haier says. The company announced the new refrigerators at the IFA trade show in Berlin on Thursday.

The internet-connected Link Cook refrigerators also include an interactive touchscreen on the top-right door that's reminiscent of the Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator, with apps that let you access information including weather and emails. One of the Link Cook refrigerators has a door-in-door alongside the touchscreen, which lets you open a panel on the front of the fridge to get access items on the in-door shelves without opening the entire refrigerator door.

The refrigerators are a part of Haier's U+ Smart Home Platform, which connects the Link Cook Series to a Haier oven and range hood. According to Haier, you'll be able to select a recipe on the refrigerator, automatically send the heating instructions to the oven and view the recipe on a small screen on the range hood.

Details are slim about Haier's refrigerators. There's no word yet on when the refrigerator will be available, how much it will cost or the countries in which it will be sold. And the company hasn't yet explained how cameras and software will work together to identify your food and give you meal suggestions. But it's clear that Haier, like other appliance manufacturers, are believers in the idea that the refrigerator is the center of the smart home.

TruSense focuses the smart home on senior citizens|"

Pitched as an alternative to retirement homes and emergency pendants, TruSense uses smart home gear to help senior citizens live independently for longer. Complete with motion sensing, temperature monitoring, leak detection and even voice controls, TruSense is a DIY kit of connected products sold alongside a monitoring service and an app that helps you track the habits of your aging parents so you'll know if something unusual occurs.

A startup based in Cincinnati, TruSense doesn't actually use any of its own hardware. The motion sensors and hub come from SmartThings; TruSense uses an Amazon Echo Dot for voice control. The $200 starter kit contains the following pieces:

You can purchase more devices if you need to, and the TruSense platform also offers a leak detector, a flush sensor and GPS trackers -- either a pendant, a vehicle tracker, or a GPS SmartSole which embeds a tracker in a shoe sole.

Between these pieces, the TruSense app will track what room your parents are in, and chart their activity over time so you can see patterns and be notified if something changes. The door/window sensors can be put on the fridge or cabinet to help you keep track of their eating habits. A motion sensor in the bedroom will try to interpret when they go to sleep and let you know if they're not getting up in the morning.

To make use of TruSense's app, you'll need to pay a $50-per-month subscription fee, but that price includes a monitoring service. You can customize what notifications you'll receive, and also what notifications will alert the monitoring service. Your parents can also use the Amazon Echo Dot -- a smart speaker you can control with your voice -- to call the monitoring service for help.

The $200 price for the starting kit isn't bad. A similar SmartThings monitoring kit costs $250. The $50 a month cost is more than comparable monitoring plans from Lowe's Iris and SimpliSafe, but roughly on par with professional services like ADT and AT&T Digital Life. To be worth it in the long run, then, the app will need to offer accurate data and useful insights. You don't have to pay a monthly fee to use SmartThings gear or an Amazon Echo Dot on its own.

Starting Tuesday, you can buy a TruSense package on the company's site. For now, TruSense is only available in the US. I like the idea of bringing together disparate smart home pieces for the express purpose of helping you care for your aging parents. Check out the video above for a look at another startup with similar aims.

For TruSense, using a motion tracker to monitor sleep habits or a door/window sensor to track eating might not always produce accurate results. You could open a cabinet and not get any food, but the system will still think you've eaten. Nevertheless, if the app and monitoring service work well, TruSense could help spot something out of the ordinary and provide some peace of mind in the meantime.

Philips SceneSwitch BR30 LED review:|"

The Philips ""SceneSwitch"" line of LED light bulbs promises versatility with the flip of a switch. Each one has three different light settings -- to change between them, you just turn the bulb off and back on.

The newest SceneSwitch bulb is a BR30-shaped floodlight that'll sell for $8 at Home Depot this fall. Flip it off and back on within a few seconds to cycle through a yellowy soft white setting, a whitish daylight setting and a dimmed-down night-light setting. Like the other SceneSwitch LEDs, it's a simple and interesting way to add some limited dimmability to a fixture without needing to replace the light switch or install expensive smart bulbs.

It's also a pretty good light bulb in its own right, and one of the most efficient floodlight LEDs we've ever tested. At just 8W, each one will add less than a buck to your yearly energy bill if you run it at the brightest setting for three hours a day. By comparison, a standard 65W incandescent floodlight at three hours of usage per day will add almost $8 to your yearly energy bill.

Replace a bulb like that with the SceneSwitch floodlight, and it'll pay for itself in a little over a year. After that, it will continue saving you money for the rest of its 22-year life span -- decades longer than that incandescent would have lasted. Oh, and that longevity claim comes backed by a five-year warranty, too.

I was also impressed by the SceneSwitch bulb's brightness. Philips clocks it at 650 lumens for both the soft white and daylight settings (the same as you'd get from an incandescent), and 65 lumens for the night-light setting. In our lighting lab, we measured the soft white setting at 714 lumens, the daylight setting at 655 lumens and the night-light at 76 lumens. All three were accurate and comfortably above the target, and their color temperatures were right on the money, too.

My only real disappointment with the bulb is that, for now, it's only available in this multitoned version with both soft white and daylight settings. The A-shaped, 60W replacement SceneSwitch LEDs that came before it also offered soft white-only and daylight-only skews that each included three different brightness settings at the same color temperature. For me, that third brightness setting is a bigger draw than switching between soft white and daylight.

Another small criticism -- like the other SceneSwitch LEDs, the SceneSwitch floodlight is pretty mediocre at making colors pop. For something with stronger color rendering capabilities, go with the GE Reveal floodlight LED or, for a few bucks less, the Walmart Great Value floodlight LED.

It's also worth pointing out that, because of the SceneSwitch design, this bulb will not work with traditional dimmer switches. If you use switches like that, then I'd recommend the very well-rounded Cree floodlight LED, as well as Philips' standard floodlight LED, which costs about $5 a bulb. Both scored very well in my dimming tests.

All of that aside, the SceneSwitch floodlight is a very good LED that gets just about everything right. With over 700 lumens, it's plenty bright -- and at 8W, it's also efficient enough to pay for itself in energy savings long before any new bulbs come along to render it obsolete. As gimmicks go, the ability to switch the bulb down to 10 percent brightness without need for a dimmer switch is a pretty likable one, and at just $8 per bulb, it won't cost you much extra at all. If that all sounds good to you, then you really don't have much to lose here.

Meet Otto, a $700 luxury smart lock|"

We keep on seeing new smart lock options, and Otto, a keyless lock designed by a former Microsoft executive, might be the fanciest yet. It had better be -- at an asking price of $699, it's one of the most expensive smart locks we've seen.

With Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios packed inside the surprisingly compact design, Otto promises to let you or anyone you choose inside with just a touch whenever it senses an authorized phone within range. Don't have your phone? Just twist and turn to enter a four-digit passcode. You can also lock and unlock Otto from anywhere using the companion app for Android and iOS devices.

Otto's creators say that they've spent four years developing the lock, and promise that it meets the sort of standards that you have to expect from one that costs $700. For starters, it comes with complimentary concierge installation -- a very nice touch given that smart locks require a properly aligned door in order to turn smoothly on their own.

""Every door is a little different, and we want to ensure the setup process is seamless,"" an Otto spokesperson tells me. ""If it turns out that Otto doesn't fit your front door, we'll happily take it back free of charge.""

That complimentary concierge installation is only a limited-time offer, though -- at some point, Otto's installation partner HomeVite will charge $149 for the service.

Otto's creators also point to the seven different grades of stainless steel used to build the lock, and the fact that it's endured extensive durability tests. They also tell us that the lock's software can distinguish between phones that are inside the home and ones that are outside, which is important -- you don't want someone to be able to open the lock simply because you left your phone sitting on an interior table within Bluetooth range.

As for cyber security, they claim that Otto's asymmetric cryptography and PKI encryption have never been known to be successfully hacked.

With no place to put a key, there's zero chance of anyone ever picking their way past Otto, either. That's part of the appeal of keyless locks like these, but it also puts some pressure on the developers to keep things running smoothly. Just recently, a company called LockState left hundreds of customers locked out after a botched firmware update essentially bricked people's front doors. Without a keyway, there's no real backup plan for a situation like that.

The other potential lock-out scenario is the battery running dead, and it's more of a concern with Otto than with the competition. That's because, unlike most other smart locks, Otto includes a built-in Wi-Fi radio for remote control via the app when you're not at home. That's a nice convenience, but Wi-Fi is a bigger battery drain than Bluetooth, Z-Wave or Zigbee.

Otto's team tells us that the two CR123A batteries that keep the lock powered should last a couple of months -- when they're running low, you'll get an alert on your phone and on the lock itself. Fail to change them, and the lock will switch to standby mode and run using a non-rechargeable backup battery.

Competing keyless locks like the Kwikset Obsidian and the Yale Assure let you power the deadbolt from the outside by touching a 9V battery to a set of nodes on the bottom of the lock, but not Otto -- once that backup battery dies, the lock is completely inaccessible from the outside.

One positive: Otto's team tells me that, once it kicks in, the backup battery can stay in standby mode for up to a year and a half.

You shouldn't need me to tell you that $700 is a hell of a lot to spend on a lock, but Otto wouldn't be the first product to break through from the high end. Just look at the Nest thermostat, which used a distinctive design and elegant controls to became one of the smart home's biggest success stories in spite of a relatively exorbitant price tag. Turns out that people are willing to spend on good-looking tech that'll sit in a prominent place in their home and be used every day.

Of course, you could nearly buy three Nests for the price of one Otto (or three similarly featured Kwikset Kevo smart locks, for that matter), so I wouldn't expect a huge influx of sales right out of the gate. But if Otto tests well (and you can bet that we'll be testing it out in the CNET Smart Home as soon as we can), then it'll sit as a legitimately tempting splurge for anyone interested in smart locks.

Something else to watch for is whether or not Otto ends up syncing with any third-party smart home platforms. There's nothing like that to speak of at launch -- no Alexa, no HomeKit, no IFTTT, no nothin' -- but an Otto spokesperson tells us that those kinds of integrations are on the horizon. ""Otto was built to be updated, and integrating these platforms is definitely something we're working on in the future,"" he says.

Preorders for Otto are open now on Otto's website, with units expected to arrive sometime this fall. Otto is compatible with Apple devices running iOS 10 or later and Android devices running Marshmallow or better. To check if your door is compatible, click here."
Wallflower review:|"

In the best case scenario, you wouldn't need the Wallflower. This $170, Wi-Fi-enabled smart plug connects to your electric stove and sends you alerts on your smartphone via the Wallflower app if you left your stove on when you're not home. These alerts could, in theory, prevent kitchen fires.

The Wallflower lives up to its promise to detect whether your stove is in use with little effort. It's also easy to use: Insert the Wallflower in your wall outlet, plug your electric stove into the Wallflower, connect it to your home's Wi-Fi network through the Wallflower app. When you turn your stove on, the Wallflower lets out a loud beep.

From the app, you can see if your stove is in use (it doesn't differentiate between a burner or the oven being on, but it can detect when either is engaged) or still hot. You can also set cooking timers and receive notifications when the timer is up. And if you allow the Wallflower app to receive location information, it will send you a notification if the device detects that your stove is on but you're outside of a set radius of your home address.

The problem with the Wallflower is that it doesn't do more than just tell you about the status of your stove. Unlike the $495 iGuardStove Intelligent, another safety-minded stove smart plug, the Wallflower won't automatically turn off your stove. So if you do receive an alert, you'll have to go back home or the home of a loved one to turn the stove off.

The Wallflower will give you some peace of mind if you're the forgetful type or want to keep an eye on someone's stove usage (for example, an older adult who lives alone). Just be willing to get in your car if someone leaves a burner on."
Is Eight Sleep’s new Mars+ mattress out of this world?|"

Startup Eight Sleep is on a mission: to bring quality shut-eye to the masses. Its new flagship product -- the Mars+ Smart Mattress -- promises to do just that. The Mars+ is available now at Best Buy, Costco and Eight Sleep's online store; prices start at $1,299 for a full mattress.

Note: Eight Sleep products are not yet sold internationally, but $1,299 coverts to roughly £1,015 and AU$1,640 at the current exchange rate.

Here's an overview of the Mars+ Smart Mattress:

In addition to basic sleep tracking and the existing integration with Nest's Learning Thermostat, Eight Sleep says its app will soon control more third-party smart products like lights and locks. And its upcoming Alexa Skill means you can simply ask the voice assistant how well you slept last night.

The Mars+ sounds pretty smart, but it's also quite similar in concept to Sleep Number's line of connected mattresses -- the 360 Bed, in particular. We'll just have to bring in both to find out which one really offers the best night's sleep.

Eight Sleep today also announced its more affordable smart mattress, the Saturn+, starting at just $699/£545/AU$880.

Sync Nanoleaf’s LED panels to music with the Aurora Rhythm|"

Nanoleaf teased the release of its sound module back in January – a plug-in gizmo that would transform the lighting startup's Aurora LED panels into fun, easy-to-program music visualizers.

Today, Nanoleaf has finally made good on its promise with the new Aurora Rhythm. The Aurora Rhythm module is a small plug-in device that can connect to any Nanoleaf LED panel. Complete with an integrated sound sensor, the Rhythm is supposed to be able to detect ""beats, sounds and melodies"" and display them visually through Nanoleaf's color-changing LED panels.

Available in stores in the US starting on September 25 and in Europe via Amazon and the Apple Store starting on October 1, the Aurora Rhythm will be sold two ways.

Folks just discovering the color-changing Aurora panels can buy the Aurora Smarter Rhythm Kit for $230 (roughly £180 and AU$290 converted). It's essentially an Aurora Starter Kit bundled with an Aurora Rhythm module. Existing Aurora customers interested in this feature can buy a standalone Aurora Rhythm for $50/£40/AU$60.

The original $200/£155/AU$250 Aurora Starter Kit will continue to be sold, too, as well as LED panel expansion packs for 60 bucks each (£45/AU$75).

Beyond viewing and making changes to Rhythm settings in Nanoleaf's Android or iPhone app, this discreet module is also compatible with Siri, Alexa and the Google Assistant. A button on the Aurora Rhythm also allows for manual adjustments. IFTTT integration as well as a software developer kit (SDK) are also available for more advanced automations.

As soon as we get our hands on an Aurora Rhythm, we'll be testing it out with our existing Nanoleaf wall panels at CNET's Smart Apartment. Stay tuned.

Orbit B-Hyve review:|"

When you first install the Orbit B-Hyve, you might not think it's that different from an ordinary sprinkler controller. The large central dial, the four large buttons and the clunky LCD display all give the impression that you're dealing with outdated technology. Indeed, Orbit's first smart sprinkler doesn't stray far from the company's non-smart options in appearance, and Orbit has been making sprinkler controllers for decades.

In this way, the B-Hyve stands in stark contrast to the excellent Rachio Smart Sprinkler, which started from scratch as a smart device. Not all of the B-Hyve's differences from Rachio's sprinkler are a bad thing. If you're a fan of manual controls or you want to save money, Orbit's B-Hyve might be the better option for you than the Rachio at about twice the price (more on pricing later). You even have to pay extra for a waterproof case from Rachio. Orbit's waterproof casing is built in and part of its industrial appearance.

Price aside, the Rachio Controller is the better smart device -- it has a wider mix of smart scheduling options and does a better job of integrating into an existing smart home setup. Taken on its own, the B-Hyve's certainly no slouch. It works with Amazon's assistant Alexa, and will schedule your sprinklers for you based on the weather. The B-Hyve is worth your consideration as a cheap, competent, but not-quite-as-smart alternative to the Rachio Controller.

Not only is the Orbit B-Hyve cheaper than Rachio, it's one of the least expensive smart sprinkler controllers you can find. Like most competitors in the growing smart sprinkler category, the B-Hyve replaces the existing controller for your in-ground sprinklers. Connect it to your Wi-Fi and download the B-Hyve app, and you'll be able to control your sprinklers with your phone.

The B-Hyve also monitors the local weather, and will schedule your sprinklers for you if you'd like. Like most smart sprinklers, it's approved by the EPA WaterSense program. Head here to see if you'd qualify for a rebate on your water bill. So not only does the B-Hyve make it easier to control and schedule your sprinklers, but it can theoretically help you water more efficiently and save you money as a result.

You can buy the Orbit B-Hyve online in the US via the company's site or Amazon. It's also available in hardware stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot. The six-zone model costs $100 and the 12-zone model is $120. The B-Hyve is also available in the UK and Australia. The six-zone controller is £150 on Amazon.co.uk. The US price converts to roughly AU$130 and AU$150 for the six- and 12-zone models respectively.

If you're not familiar with advanced sprinkler timers, you might be intimidated by all of the B-Hyve's options. Setup is as simple as connecting wires for power and each of your zones. If you can install a thermostat, you can install the B-Hyve.

Once you're up and running, the left side of the screen serves as the menu. Seemingly redundant options such as ""manual,"" ""run time"" and ""start time"" make using the display confusing. So keep the instruction manual handy if you'd rather set up your schedule with the manual controls rather than the app.

The app simplifies your options for controlling and scheduling your sprinklers, and it's generally much easier to use than the physical controls. Still, it's not perfect. I wish it showed a little more detail as far as weather info. Rachio lets you choose where you get your weather info. Orbit doesn't offer that layer of customization. The calendar could have also used an extra layer or two of info.

Once you set a program or a schedule, you'll be able to see dots on the days when your system is set to water. Tap a day, and it'll show you the start time of each program, but you can't see much more detail than that, even if you tap the time to pull up additional details. The calendar entry never shows you a full play by play of which zones are going to run and for how long in each session.

The main page of the app lets you set a rain delay, or manually turn your sprinklers on or off. You can access the details of each zone in the zone page, and set up schedules and programs in the programs page.

Under the zones page, you can give the B-Hyve the details it needs to set your schedule for you under ""smart details."" For each zone, you can set the soil type, plant type, sprinkler type, amount of sunlight, slope and how many sprinklers are in the zone. You can also set up catch cups to determine exactly how much water hits your yard between rain and the sprinklers for a more exact estimate of soil moisture.

If you're an expert, the B-Hyve has an advanced details section that lets you fine-tune stats such as ""Reference Evapotranspiration"" and ""Landscape Coefficient."" If you don't know what those terms mean, don't worry, the B-Hyve makes an educated guess and fills in values based on the basic details you provide. Like Rachio, Orbit does a good job of combining easy-to-use options for beginners with hidden depth for experts.

Once you get your zones set, you can turn on smart watering for each and the B-Hyve will track your soil moisture, watch the weather and water when necessary. The B-hyve specifically waters your lawn for short 10- to 15-minute bursts for each zone to prevent runoff.

You can refine the B-Hyve's smart watering program if you have watering restrictions or preferred watering times, or let the system take care of everything for you. Alternatively, you can set up scheduled programs manually and ignore the smart feature.

Over our two weeks of testing, the B-hyve's smart scheduling worked as well as the Rachio's and accurately responded to the weather. You can always manually run the sprinklers or put in a rain delay if it misses something.

Rachio offers a few more scheduling options than Orbit. With the B-Hyve, you either set a smart schedule or a manual schedule. You can combine the two, but the B-Hyve warns you of the possibility of overwatering if you do that. Rachio lets you pick from a variety of fixed or flexible schedules and always offers its smarts to make sure you're not running your sprinklers in the rain.

Rachio's smart sprinkler not only offers more scheduling options than the B-hyve, it also works with several more smart home partners. Head here for Rachio's full list of compatible devices. Highlights include Amazon's Alexa and the Google Home for voice controls. You can also tie Rachio's sprinkler to your larger smart home setup with Wink, SmartThings and IFTTT.

The B-Hyve also works with Amazon's Alexa, but that's it. Alexa is Amazon's digital assistant built into a variety of smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo. With a simple voice command, you can turn your B-Hyve sprinklers on or off, check when they ran last or set a rain delay. Head here for the full list of the B-Hyve's Alexa commands.

Oddly, Alexa had a little trouble turning my sprinklers on at first. I had only used smart scheduling to that point, and if I gave the command ""Ask B-Hyve to run the sprinklers"" Alexa would agree and nothing would happen. Alexa would actually turn on the sprinkler if I said something more specific such as, ""Run station 1.""

Once I set a few manual programs, Alexa then properly turned on the sprinklers after my first command and ran one of my established programs. Apparently, the system doesn't know what to do if you don't offer specifics and don't have any programs set. I was also initially confused because Alexa only responds to the word ""station"" and not ""zone,"" but both of these issues were minor.

Controlling Rachio's sprinkler with Alexa is more tedious. If you don't offer specifics right away, Alexa can get caught in a loop. Surprisingly, given all of Rachio's other smart home credentials, the B-Hyve's integration with Alexa works more reliably and intuitively than Rachio's. So at least the B-Hyve has a bit of quality to combat Rachio's quantity.

Between the accurate and easy-to-use smart scheduling and the helpful Alexa skill, the Orbit B-Hyve will add a lot of convenience to your life if you're used to controlling your sprinklers with an old-fashioned timer. The price is right, as the B-Hyve's only $100 for six zones or $120 for twelve -- that's as budget-friendly as it gets for a controller with comparable smarts.

Orbit deserves credit for successfully ushering its classic controller to the modern age while keeping the basics like manual controls intact. The B-Hyve isn't perfect and the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller is the better option if price isn't an issue. You'll also want to go with Rachio if you have lots of other smart home devices. The B-Hyve is the best option in terms of value, especially if you just want basic sprinkler smarts."
iDevices' new smart dimmer switch works with Alexa, Google, and Siri|"

There are lots of ways to put smart home tech to work, but one of the easiest and most compelling might be voice-activated control of your lights. Now, iDevices is releasing a smart dimmer switch that'll get the job done no matter which voice control platform you're using.

Fittingly enough, it's called the iDevices Dimmer Switch, and it promises compatibility with Alexa, Siri and the Google Assistant for an asking price of $100. Wire it into your wall in place of one of your existing light switches, and you'll be able to program that light to turn on and off automatically, control it remotely from your phone or adjust the brightness using voice commands.

The Dimmer Switch joins a growing family of iDevices smart home gadgets that already includes a plug-in smart switch, a connected thermostat, a screw adapter for light bulbs, a smart wall outlet and more. Like the dimmer, all of them work with all three major voice control platforms, making the entire lineup accessible to just about anyone who's interested in smartening up their living space.

It might be an especially sound business strategy given that iDevices was recently bought out by Hubbell, a lighting and electrical manufacturer. As part of that acquisition, iDevices has pivoted slightly towards the dealer market, and begun pitching its products not only as DIY upgrades, but also as parts of professionally-installed smart home packages. Dealers like those want products that'll work with as many customers as possible, regardless of which voice assistant they prefer.

That puts iDevices squarely in between those higher-end dealer setups and cheaper, self-installed gadgets like the Belkin WeMo Dimmer, which costs $80. That rival already works with Alexa and with Google, but won't work with Siri until Belkin releases its upcoming Apple HomeKit plug-in bridge later this year. Even after it arrives, the iDevices Dimmer is still likely to be the more tempting option for anyone who wants to build their smart home around Siri given that it doesn't require you to purchase any extra hardware to hop in with HomeKit.

Another big differentiator: the iDevices Dimmer Switch will work with three-way switch setups, where more than one light switch controls the same light or set of lights. The WeMo Dimmer doesn't.

The iDevices Dimmer Switch is available now for $100. Expect us to wire one in at the CNET Smart Home for tests and a full review in the coming weeks."
Reolink Argus review:|"

Reolink's Argus won't be right for everyone, but this $100 DIY security camera does fill a niche: it's affordable, battery-powered and weatherproof. The versatility of a cord-free camera means the Argus can go anywhere within range of your Wi-Fi network -- either inside or out.

It has a serious lack of features, though. You won't find cloud recording, smart home integrations, activity zones, geofencing or a web app. It also requires four pricey and hard-to-find CR123A batteries, the same as Netgear's original $180 Arlo camera (Netgear upgraded to rechargeable batteries with its premium $250 Netgear Arlo Pro).

But, the Argus is much less expensive than Netgear's Arlo lineup, as well as other battery-powered outdoor cameras like the $199 Canary Flex. If you already have a microSD card, don't care about extra features and are fine swapping out CR123A's every 6 months, Reolink's Argus might be right for you.

Note: The Reolink Argus is currently only available in the US. At the current exchange rate, $100 converts to roughly £75 and AU$125.

The Argus mostly holds its own alongside Netgear's Arlo Pro and Canary's Flex in the chart above. It has a higher 1080p HD resolution, a competitive six months of expected battery life, a wide viewing angle and more.

But its lack of cloud storage means you must use a microSD card to save footage locally. The Argus supports up to a 64GB microSD card, but one isn't included with your purchase.

Its 1080p HD resolution comes by way of a 2-megapixel sensor and a frame rate of 15 frames per second. The 1080p HD Nest Cam Outdoor, in contrast, has a 3-megapixel sensor and 30 frames per second.

While a higher frame rate requires more storage space/processing power, it also contributes to a smoother video feed. So, even though the Argus has 1080p resolution, it doesn't have the same video quality as many other 1080p cameras -- and even some 720p cameras such as the Canary Flex.

Still, the Argus is a decent, less expensive way to keep an eye on your yard. And if you happen to prefer local storage, the Argus could be just the outdoor camera you're looking for. Most folks should strongly consider Netgear's Arlo, Arlo Pro and the Canary Flex first, though. All three cameras offer free cloud storage and more features than Reolink's simple $100 Argus."
Weber Genesis II E-310 review:|"

Weber's reputation for building durable, practical outdoor grills goes back decades. Now the company wants you to think smart, too, when you think Weber. To that end, the $850 Weber Genesis II E-310 has lots of what you expect from a Weber BBQ, plus a side of app connectivity.

To enable the smarts on this already expensive propane cooker you'll need to shell out an extra $100 for Weber's iGrill 3 accessory. It's actually a fairly useful add-on, but it's not included in the core product. Due to three powerful burners and sensitive heat controls, mastering your grilling technique on this hot-rod cooker also takes practice.

All this makes the Genesis II suited to more experienced grill enthusiasts with the patience to master this high-end unit. If smarts in a more forgiving high-end grill is what you want, the $800 Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared is slightly cheaper and easier to use.

I appreciate how sturdy and solid the Genesis II feels. Its lid and pair of side tables are built from heavy steel. Both the grill's cast iron grates and lid are enameled in porcelain too. My only complaint, a minor one, is Weber's choice to use some plastic in the E-310's construction. The ends of the grill's side tables are wrapped in gray plastic bumpers that cheapens its appearance. The same goes for the plastic trim on the lid. Still, the lid does have a large built-in thermometer, a Weber standard feature the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared lacks.

The Genesis II relies on what Weber calls the ""GS4 High Performance Grilling System,"" which involves three propane burners each rated at a robust 37,500 BTU. That's plenty of heating power to have at your disposal. The Char-Broil SmartChef, by comparison, has three gas burners as well, but they provide less oomph at just 25,000 BTU apiece. You do get a small side burner with Char-Broil's SmartChef grill, a feature Weber includes on various grills across its product lines, but not on this one.

Both grills differ in the way they cook your food. The Genesis II uses wedge-shaped bars to cover and protect its burners from grease and drippings. The bars also act as deflectors to spread heat evenly across the grilling surface above as well. All three burners are lit by the same ignition module and its corresponding igniter button. You have to supply it with AA disposable batteries, as you do with most other propane grills. Each of the burners have their own weather-resistant electrodes, however, to improve reliability. Weber refers to the design as ""Infinity Ignition.""

The SmartChef protects its burners with similar protective bars, though it calls them ""heat tents."" Char-Broil also introduces a second part in the mix, a thin steel plate just below its grates and above the burners. A component in Char-Broil's ""Tru-Infrared"" grilling system, the plate is designed to absorb the heat from the burners, and use it to mimic the radiant heat you get from charcoal. The different cooking methods likely explain the results of my cooking tests, too. I'll get to that soon.

One huge advantage of Weber's Genesis II grill design is it's a snap to clean. It has large parts, and only a few of them. They're also spaced out well so pulling the machine apart for maintenance is easy. Weber also built an elegant grease management system at the heart of the cooker. Any juices and drippings that make it past the burners are funneled towards a waiting disposable drip tray for collection.

The Weber Genesis II E-310 is among just a few backyard grills that support smart technology. Weber didn't create this tech on its own -- it acquired the iGrill brand from iDevices, a line of Bluetooth, app-connected thermometers, including the $50 iGrill Mini.

The latest product to join the iGrill line postacquisition is the $100 iGrill 3, and it works as an add-on to Weber's Genesis II and Genesis II LX grills that fits into a physical socket on the front of those units. Weber pushes the iGrill 3 as an upgrade meant for its Genesis II grills alone but aside from the tailored receptacle, it will work fine with any brand of grill, it just won't have a dedicated slot to mount it securely.

All of the various iGrill models link to the Weber mobile app, which lets you monitor the Genesis II wirelessly from a distance of 30 feet. The scope of the app is narrow compared to Char-Broil's SmartChef application. SmartChef tackles lots of things besides food. It tracks propane levels, burner status and even tells you if the grill is cool enough to cover. Weber's app just sticks to measuring temperatures of meat, fish and poultry as you cook.

Regardless I prefer Weber's targeted approach and the iGrill software overall. The app is intuitive, cleanly organized and uncluttered. Barbecue enthusiasts will enjoy the handy graph that extrapolates when your meal will be done based on current conditions. My favorite feature is how the software pings you when you're 10 degrees out from your probe's target temp. It then pings you each time the thermometer rises by 1 degree until your food is done.

The application's connection to its probes was continuous and always ready to display temperatures in real time. By contrast the Char-Broil SmartChef app usually lost temperature probe data if I closed it or simply opened another application on my phone (a Google Pixel XL). Another advantage the iGrill app has over SmartChef is a simple wizard to setup probes to actively monitor your food while it cooks. For example, you can select the food type (chicken, burgers, steak and so on) and iGrill knows what target temperature you need to hit. You can also choose the level of doneness you'd like and the app adapts accordingly.

This is a big catch though. To add smarts to the Genesis II you'll need to purchase the iGrill 3 accessory separately, a $100 upgrade. All of the Char-Broil SmartChef grill's technology comes built-in. Still, especially if you're a new to grilling or you simply like to cook with precision, the iGrill 3 is a worthwhile addition to this or any other grill, since it makes cooking tricky items such as poultry and big cuts of steak safer and easier.

Grilling on the Weber Genesis II takes practice. I learned that while its burners are mighty, they also offer a wide temperature range which can be unforgiving if you're not careful. For example, when I turned the Genesis II's burner dials all the way up, after 10 minutes the temperature under the hood easily cracked 600 degrees (633.7 in fact). That same high setting and preheat time on the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared yielded an internal temp of 457.4 degrees. Likewise, medium power on the Genesis, especially cooking with indirect heat, was much cooler than I expected. This resulted in unacceptably long cooking times even when all its burner knob markings were parked dead center of its dial.

To measure how grills perform under high heat conditions, I subjected them to our burger test. This exercise shows how much raw power a grill can bring to the table. I ran three such tests of six 5.3-ounce burgers each pressed from the same hamburger press. I flipped all of the burners on high and gave the grill 10 minutes to preheat.

After that I arranged the patties on the grill in a rectangular pattern (two patties high, three across) with 1.5 to 2 inches spacing between them. I inserted one of the iGrill probes into the center, front patty. I closed the hood, and gave the burgers a flip after 6 minutes. With the lid closed again, I recorded how long it took the internal burger temp to hit 145 degrees. The Genesis II took 10 minutes and 10 seconds for its burgers to finish, just 5 seconds faster than the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared.

The Genesis II produced patties with a decent crust but considerable char too. Searing for too long or at too high heat levels gives food burnt charcoal flavors I'd rather do without. Unfortunately the insides of these burgers were also on the dry side. By contrast I found the burgers from the Char-Broil grill juicier, and with more flavor.

The Genesis II turned in mixed results on our beer can chicken test, designed to assess how well a grill operates at medium heat. I again used one of the grill's probes to tell me when the internal temperature reached 165 degrees. I also set the left and right burners to the midway mark as indicated by on their dials. Since indirect heat is the goal here, I left the center burner off.

Usually a 5 to 6 pound bird takes anywhere from 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours to finish cooking. Unfortunately the Genesis failed this first attempt, requiring almost 4 hours for its probe to hit the magic number. The temperature inside the grill box hovered at around 250 degrees with the left and right burner dials at the medium setting. It also took a long 55 minutes to reach this temp. After seeing the test through to the end (when the probes hit the temp), the chicken was inedible. Its skin was as leathery as a football and the flesh inside was watery, mushy and thoroughly unappetizing.

For the second test, I bumped up the dials a tiny fraction above their midpoint, and the temperature inside the grill rocketed up to 460 degrees in 30 minutes where it stayed. The bird hit 165 in a quick 1 hour 14 minutes. Its skin was nicely roasted and crisp too. The dark meat was especially tender and moist. White meat from the breast was slightly dry, however, and overcooked.

I used a rack of pork ribs for our low temperature test. For this test I started all three of the grill's burners and left them running full blast for 10 minutes (lid closed). In the meantime, I seasoned one rack of St. Louis-style pork spareribs (3.6 pounds) with ordinary dry rub mix sourced from the local supermarket.

I draped the ribs across the Genesis II's metal warming tray that sits above the grill grates. Finally I dialed all three burner knobs down to their lowest setting and closed the lid. I cooked two racks this way; the first I ran for 3 hours, the second for 3 hours 30 minutes. On both the CharBroil SmartChef and Weber Genesis II, the ribs were too thin to shield their probes from ambient hot air under the lid. As a result I fell back to cooking by time instead of hitting a target thermometer reading. Both grills turned in slightly underdone ribs after a 3-hour cook, so I bumped the time up another 30 minutes for round two.

Similar to how this Weber grill treated burgers, the Genesis II pumped out more heat than was necessary. On both the 3 hour and the 3 hour 30 minute runs, the ribs were good but too crisp and dry for my taste. The solution lies with some different combination of cooking time and temperature, but within the confines of the time allotted for this review, I had to stop there. The takeaway is that you can expect some trial and error before you find the path to delicious ribs from this Weber.

In contrast, the Char-Broil SmartChef over the same time period came out much better. Same prepackaged ribs from Costco, same dry rub seasoning. Especially at the longer cook time, the CharBroil ribs were dripping with moisture and succulent. Yum.

Weber is one of the most popular grill brands in the US. That's why I'm surprised by the unpredictable behavior the $850 Weber Genesis II E-310 demonstrated on our tests. This isn't to say this is a bad product, it's simply that you'll likely need to learn its quirks before you achieve the best grilling results.

For that reason, splurging on the Genesis II's $100 iGrill 3 smart accessory could make sense. It will certainly take the guesswork out of learning its temperature settings. Still, $950 all-in is a heck of a lot of cash to spend on a grill, especially for the more casual outdoor cook."
Sylvania Smart Multicolor LED (Apple HomeKit-enabled) review:|"

Connected lighting is often a simple smart home starting point, and Sylvania's new Apple HomeKit-compatible, color-changing smart bulb wants to be as simple as it gets. With a Bluetooth radio built into each bulb, there's no need to plug a hub into your router -- just screw in, turn on, and sync with Siri. The cost? $45 per bulb.

That HomeKit compatibility means that you'll control the bulb on your iOS device using Apple's Home app instead of a dedicated Sylvania app. The Home app lets you control the Sylvania bulb alongside other Apple-friendly gadgets, and it also lets you pin quick bulb controls to your phone's Control Center, or control the bulb using spoken Siri commands. That includes changing the color of the bulb, but those controls don't go as deep as what you'll find in the apps for Lifx or Philips Hue, where color-changing light controls are the core feature.

Still, Sylvania's LED costs a little less than Lifx or Hue, and while $45 is still a lot to spend on a light bulb, Sylvania's positioned itself pretty well here -- especially as an alternative for Apple loyalists looking to build a smart home around Siri. It that sounds like you, and smart, color-changing light is something you're willing to spend on, then give this light a look.

Like most every LED light bulb, the Sylvania Smart Plus LED uses a fraction of the energy needed to power a common incandescent bulb, but still claims to put out the same level of brightness -- 800 lumens, per Sylvania. I used our integrating sphere and spectrometer to test that claim, and clocked the default, soft white setting at 755 lumens -- just within the margin of error of that 800-lumen claim. It's not as bright as the Lifx LED, which gets up over 1,000 lumens at its default setting, but it's a bit brighter than Philips Hue, and plenty bright to call itself a 60W replacement.

Though accurate, Sylvania's colors were much less bright, ranging between roughly 80 and 200 lumens depending on the shade. That's typical of color-changing bulbs like these, since the majority of the brightness comes from the white-light diodes. Still, it's worth noting that Lifx offers a lot more oomph across the spectrum, and also lets you add the white light in on top of the colors for brighter, more subtle tints. It's still the smart bulb I'd recommend for people who just want the brightest, best-looking colors.

Lifx and Hue also offer dedicated, fully featured apps for color control, as well as a wide range of integrations with third-party platforms and devices. Both work with Alexa and with Google Home for voice-activated color changes, both will sync up with the Nest Learning Thermostat, and both have channels on the free online automation service IFTTT. Hue already works with HomeKit, too, and HomeKit support for Lifx bulbs, though long delayed at this point, is still in the cards, as well.

By comparison, Sylvania leans entirely on HomeKit, and on the Home app for quick lighting controls. It doesn't work with Alexa or with the Google Assistant or with third-party platforms like SmartThings and Wink (though it's important to note that Sylvania also sells a nearly identical, non-HomeKit-compatible smart bulb that works with all of those. Yes, it's a bit confusing).

At any rate, the focus on HomeKit makes the bulb a good fit if you're already using a variety of Siri-compatible gadgets and just want to add color-changing light into the mix. However, if you want deep, fully featured color control to be a centerpiece of your smart home, then the Home app leaves a lot to be desired.

It makes a good first impression, though. To pair the bulb, you'll just screw it in and turn it on, then tap the little plus sign icon in the Home app. You'll point your phone's camera at the eight-digit pairing code in the Sylvania manual, then let the app do the rest. I had my test bulb up and running in under a minute.

From there, you can use the assign the bulb to a room to group it with other HomeKit devices, or tap to turn it on and off or adjust its brightness. You can switch the color or color temperature, too, though the controls are pretty rudimentary. You won't find additional options for matching the color of a photograph, or customizing a color cycle, for instance. And, if you want to control your bulb remotely when you're out of Bluetooth range, you'll need an Apple TV.

Controlling the bulb with Siri is pretty straightforward provided you give it a name that's easy for her to recognize. I did notice a few voice control hiccups, though -- namely, Siri hearing the word ""red"" as ""read"" and messing up my color changes. Alexa and the Google Assistant both seem to have those sorts of kinks worked out already.

The Sylvania Smart Plus LED is the first color-changing bulb that doesn't need a hub to work with HomeKit, which gives it an edge over Philips Hue. At $45 each, it costs a little less than Lifx, too.

The trade-off is that it isn't as fully featured as either of those, but if HomeKit-supported color changes are all you want, then you might not notice or care. If you're itching for Siri-powered smart lighting, it's certainly worthy of consideration.

Editor's note, 8/16/17, 9:55 AM: This review initially stated that the Sylvania Smart Plus LED uses a built-in Wi-Fi radio. That was incorrect -- it connects with users' phones and with the Apple TV for remote connections using a Bluetooth radio. The text of the review has been updated accordingly. The score and recommendation remain unchanged, though it's worth pointing out that without an Apple TV, you'll be unable to control this bulb on your phone from outside of Bluetooth range (roughly 100 feet)."
Honeywell Lyric C1 review:|"

So many of today's DIY security cameras cost $200 -- or more. Fortunately, an increasing number of manufacturers are selling models for less. Honeywell's $120 Lyric C1 Wi-Fi Security Camera is the latest example. Its main features include 720p HD live streaming, free cloud storage, local storage via an included 8GB microSD card and motion and sound alerts.

The indoor-only C1 also adds in two motion detection zones, geofencing capabilities and the promise of upcoming smart home integrations.

It isn't an exciting or particularly innovative camera, but the price is right, particularly if you're looking for extras like geofencing and an included microSD card. At the current exchange rate, $120 converts to roughly £90 and AU$150.

When compared alongside some other security cameras in a similar price range -- the iSmartAlarm Spot and the Zmodo Pivot -- the C1 doesn't stand out very much. But it has a couple of bonus features: motion zones and geofencing. Motion zones let you customize what areas in your camera's field of view actually detect and alert you to unexpected activity. Geofencing automatically turns your camera on and off whenever you leave and return home (based on your phone's location). Honeywell is also working on smart home integrations for this camera. Honeywell's Lyric T5 thermostat already works with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, IFTTT and Google Home, so hopefully similar pairings are in the works for their C1 camera.

The main question, though, is whether the C1 is better than iSmartAlarm's Spot. The C1 costs a little more, but comes with an included microSD card, zones and geofencing. It doesn't have as many smart home integrations as Spot, but that could soon change. Ultimately, both cameras are decent options -- consider what features matter most to you and go from there."
SimpliSafe SimpliCam review:|"

The $100 SimpliCam is SimpliSafe's long-awaited response to customers wanting a camera as part of their home security setup. Buy one (or several) to accompany your DIY SimpliSafe system -- or just use them as standalone cameras.

While 100 bucks is a pretty good price for a 720p live-streaming camera, SimpliSafe borrows the same surprisingly rigid fee model from its existing system. That means it charges (optional, but largely necessary) monthly fees, even for the most basic features. Want to view live video via the web app? There's a monthly fee. How about event-based cloud video storage? Yep, same deal.

Now that so many other DIY security systems -- and cameras -- exist in the market, SimpliSafe's approach is growing increasingly stale. Live streaming and other standard features worked fine for me, but is this thing worth $100 (roughly £75 and AU$125 converted)? Absolutely not.

After reviewing the key features offered on three DIY indoor cameras that cost at or under $100, SimpliSafe's SimpliCam clearly lags behind. The $60 Lynx camera by Tend Secure has the best price, resolution and free cloud storage offering. It has pretty solid facial recognition capabilities, too -- also totally free. iSmartAlarm's Spot wins in terms of storage choices, since it comes with cloud and local storage (the microSD card is not included). Spot also works with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT for creating advanced smart home automations.

SimpliCam just doesn't do enough to justify its purchase. That's particularly true when you compare it to other security cameras in roughly the same price range. Would you rather have free cloud storage or pay $5 per month for it? The choice is simple."
Anker's new Alexa smart speaker is a dirt-cheap Echo Dot|"

The Genie is an Alexa-enabled smart speaker that'll sell for just $35. It's the newest gadget in Anker's Eufy range of smart home products, which Anker -- previously best known for making USB chargers -- kicked off last year.

In a nutshell, the Genie is just a cheaper version of the Amazon Echo Dot. You'll plug it in, sync it up with your home network, then tell it to stream some music, play a podcast, turn your lights off, set a timer, or anything else you might think to ask.

It includes the same far-field microphones that can hear you from across the room whenever you say the wake word ""Alexa."" It works with the same services and smart home products. It features the same access to more than 10,000 free Alexa skills, each of which teaches Alexa to do something new. It's everything people like about Amazon's voice assistant in a slightly more affordable package.

With its 2W speaker, Eufy also promises ""better sound,"" though the press release never specifies what it's actually better than. At 70 percent of the Echo Dot's cost, I'd be satisfied if the sound was 70 percent as strong, but that wouldn't be saying much given that the Dot's puny speaker wasn't designed to fill a room. At any rate, the sound quality might be a moot point since, like the Dot, you can connect the Genie to external speakers using a 3.5mm cable.

The real idea is that the Genie will serve as the centerpiece to a new suite of Eufy smart home gadgets. First up are Wi-Fi-enabled Eufy Lumos smart bulbs coming at the end of August, available in standard white for $20 each or tunable white for $30. A new, app-enabled version of Eufy's RoboVac will come next in September -- you'll be able to buy it bundled with the Genie for just $280, which is about as affordable as voice-connected housecleaning currently gets. Eufy-branded smart plugs, smart switches, and smart light strips are in the works, too. You'll be able to control all of it using the Eufy app or by talking to Alexa, which, conveniently enough, positions the Genie right at the crossroads.

All of that makes Eufy something of an Alexa budget brand. It's hard not to call the Genie a pure Echo Dot knockoff, and with the same, voice-activated Alexa smarts as the Dot, the two might as well be functionally identical. The only real difference: The $35 Genie doesn't include support for wireless Bluetooth connections with external speakers. For that, you'll have to wait for a $40 version of the Genie with Bluetooth that's still listed as ""coming soon."" Hm.

Don't expect Amazon to complain about the copycat design, though. Shortly after the initial success of the original Amazon Echo smart speaker, the online retail giant made the software that powers Alexa available to outside developers for use in their own products. With a few lines of code, any gadget with a microphone, a speaker, and an internet connection can be an  Alexa gadget. That means more competition for the Echo and Echo Dot, but it also helps Amazon build the overall Alexa user base.

""With the Eufy Genie, customers can get Alexa, her 15,000+ skills, and high-quality sound for less than $35,"" said Steve Rabuchin, VP Amazon Alexa. ""Now even more customers will be able to simply ask Alexa to set a timer, play the news or their favorite music, control their smart home or order a meal with just their voice.""

Building that base of customers is clearly Amazon's top priority for Alexa as it fights to secure as big a share of the red-hot voice control market as it can. To that end, you'll find third-party Alexa gadgets like the Genie for sale on Amazon itself -- and virtually no sign of the Google Home smart speaker (or, presumably, the Apple HomePod smart speaker later this year). The automaker Henry Ford once famously quipped that his customers could get a Model T in any color they liked, so long as it was black. Amazon might well joke that shoppers can get a smart speaker of any brand that they like -- so long as it's Alexa.

The $35 Eufy Genie goes up for sale -- on Amazon -- on August 16. Prices and release dates for the rest of the Eufy smart home lineup are listed below.

Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller (generation 2) review:|"

Lots of smart home devices promise to revolutionize the ordinary with convenience you didn't know you needed. The Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller actually fulfills that promise. Buy it, and you'll no longer have to mess with the confusing dials and buttons of an ordinary sprinkler controller. Turn on your sprinklers with an app, or a voice command to the Amazon Echo or the Google Home. Better yet, let Rachio plan when to turn on your sprinklers for you based on the weather, and save money on water in the meantime.

It's not without its flaws -- the voice controls are wonky, you can't do much with the onboard controls if your internet is out, and you can't run multiple zones at once -- but generally, the $200 to $250 Rachio 2nd Generation Smart Sprinkler Controller succeeds at what it sets out to do. If you have an in-ground sprinkler system, the Rachio Controller is a great buy for the convenience it will add to your watering routine.

If you're ready to upgrade, know that the Rachio Controller isn't the only game in town. Fortunately, Rachio stacks up well next to the smart competition too.

Almost all smart sprinklers replace an existing controller for your in ground sprinkler system. Then, they connect to your home's Wi-Fi network, offer app controls, and help you save water by monitoring the weather and helping you adapt your schedule to accommodate for rain. Better yet, most smart controllers qualify for the EPA's WaterSense program, allowing you to get rebates on your utility bill.

Rachio does all of that, and separates itself with its extra smart home integrations. It works with both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home (both are always-listening speakers that respond to voice commands). It also works with the Nest Learning Thermostat, the online rule making platform IFTTT, and the Wink and SmartThings smart home ecosystems. Head here for a full list of Rachio's integrations.

Other smart sprinklers work with the Amazon Echo too, and the $250 GreenIQ has an impressive list of integrations of its own, but Rachio's list is the best of the bunch.

You can purchase the second-generation Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller now from the company's website. It's also available from Amazon, Home Depot, Best Buy and Lowes. An 8-zone controller costs $200 or you can buy a 16-zone unit for $250. If you'll be replacing an outdoor controller, you'll also need Rachio's $30 weatherproof casing. The Rachio Controller will work in any country, but Rachio has distribution only in North America for now. The US price converts to roughly £150 and AU$250 for the 8-zone version and £190/AU$315 for 16 zones.

I tested Rachio at the CNET Smart Home over the course of two weeks. The physical setup is roughly on the same do-it-yourself skill level as replacing your thermostat. Then, the app does the rest.

After you use the app to connect Rachio to Wi-Fi, you can hop right in and start using the controller, or you can let Rachio walk you through setting up the different zones.

Rachio's app shines both when you're setting up the zones, and when you're scheduling them. With both processes, the app puts simple, easy-to-understand options at the forefront of its interface, with plenty of room for advanced customization hidden just underneath the surface. It balances ease-of-use with depth perfectly.

Zone setup asks you to name each zone, then asks you what's growing there, what type of soil it's in, how much sun it gets, what type of sprinkler head you have in the zone, and the slope of the zone.

Again, you can skip the zone-by-zone setup and jump straight to scheduling if you'd like, but the extra details help Rachio plan for you. You can fine-tune beyond the basics if you'd like. Click on a zone in the app and you can tinker with details like root depth and crop coefficient if you're an expert. The details section also shows you the moisture level, and you can see it charted over time and tweak it as well.

Once you have the zones set the way you want them, you can schedule your sprinklers from the main page of the app according to your local restrictions, as well as your needs and preferences.

Rachio offers four scheduling options:

Basically, you can have as much input in designing your sprinkler schedule as you'd like, and Rachio will help out with its own smarts as much as it can. For comparison, the Orbit B-Hyve sprinkler lets you design your own schedule, or it'll do it for you. If you schedule yourself, you need to tell Orbit when to set a rain delay. Rachio's ready to offer automatic assistance on any schedule you set.

I set up a ""Flexible Daily"" schedule for the CNET Smart Home. I wanted to see how Rachio would do with full control over when to run the sprinklers. Even with this option, you can still specify water restriction days and your preferred start time.

Rachio starts off Flexible Daily by running a long cycle on each zone -- enough to get each zone from 0 percent to 100 percent moisture. Your lawn probably isn't at 0 when Rachio starts, but this way the system knows your lawn is all the way at one end of the spectrum and can start predicting accordingly.

After that first long run, Rachio spread out its watering over the course of the next week -- usually running one zone a day and breaking up watering times even for that single zone to let the water sink in. The system also recognized when it was raining and pushed back the scheduled days accordingly.

You can change where Rachio gets it weather info in the app, but weirdly, the Flexible Daily schedule never shows that you ""saved"" any water. The bottom of the main page shows water used and water saved per month, but with Flexible Daily, the second number remained zero.

It's an odd quirk, since Rachio should be saving you the most with this option, but it's also not cancelling sessions based on rain and thus saving water. It's just not scheduling sessions for rainy days in the first place.

Rachio's design and app have a few other minor flaws. I generally like the elegant simplicity of the controller itself -- it looks futuristic without being over-the-top -- but the onboard controls are pretty minimal so you won't be able to do much at all if your internet goes out.

You can't run multiple zones at once. Even if you use the remote control in the app to start all zones watering for five minutes, Rachio will cycle through five minutes of each zone one at a time.

The watering and schedule updates are confusing, with two or three redundant entries for each time you turn on your sprinkler. The push notifications are better, and customizable.

Most of my issues with Rachio are minor and you won't often notice them, especially once you have your schedule running. Rachio's integrations with the Amazon Echo and Google Home are more problematic.

Controlling your sprinklers with your voice definitely has a cool factor, but Rachio's skills for both the Echo and the Home need polish. They work fine when you know the exact phrase you need to say, but improvise and Amazon's assistant can get caught in a loop and the Google Home will get confused.

The second-generation Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller isn't perfect, and it's a little expensive at $200 for an 8-zone model and $250 for 16. The Blossom 8 gives you 8 zones of connected control for $150; the Orbit B-Hyve offers 12 zones of control for only $120. If you're weighing Rachio against other smart sprinklers, Rachio's app is mostly excellent. It keeps setup simple enough for beginners while offering depth for experts that want it. Plus, Rachio works with more smart home partners than the sprinkler competition.

If you're considering whether you need an upgrade at all, rest assured that Rachio's smarts aren't just for show. After a brief setup, Rachio can take care of most of your scheduling for you, and you can quickly make adjustments with the responsive app. All told, using Rachio will be exponentially easier than fiddling with the dials and buttons of an old-fashioned controller. So as a smart device that truly feels smart, I'm happy to recommend Rachio to anyone with an inground sprinkler system and a solid Wi-Fi network.

Fixed interval: Pick how often you want your lawn watered. You can also set your system to water on even or odd days. Rachio will skip days when appropriate based on the weather.Fixed days: Pick the days of the week you'd like to water. Again, Rachio will help out by skipping days when appropriate.Flexible monthly: Rachio determines a predictable schedule for you based on your zone input, the weather and the season. Flexible daily: Rachio ditches all predictability and adapts dynamically to the weather and your yard's conditions. It waters when necessary based on the moisture levels of your zones."
Oomi Home Starter Kit review:|"

Editor's Note, 11/1/17, 5:25 PM EST: Oomi has lowered the price of its starter kit in the US from $700 to $500. That's still expensive, but not unreasonably so given Oomi's versatility. We've raised the score from a 7.4 to a 7.7 as a result; the full review, as originally published, follows below.

We've seen no shortage of smart home starter kits over the past few years, and Oomi, an Indiegogo success story and perennial favorite at CES, is one of the more ambitious.

In addition to color-changing smart bulbs and attractive-looking smart plugs, Oomi's starter kit offers a Piper-like camera embedded with sensors and smarts. It's also got a sophisticated rules engine and a dedicated tablet controller that doubles as a universal remote. Along with automating all of it and using Oomi as a DIY security system, you can sync the starter kit with Alexa for voice controls, or put your Nest thermostat, Philips Hue bulbs and Z-Wave devices under Oomi's control. All of Oomi's gadgets have near-field communication (NFC) built in, so you can connect each device just by tapping it with the tablet.

There's a ""but"" coming, though, and it's a big one. Sure, Oomi is a likable smart home system, but it costs $700. I rarely get to use exclamation points in my reviews, so allow me to seize the opportunity: $700!

Oomi points to the versatility of the system to justify the expense. That's all well and good, but consider this. If you swapped an Amazon Echo Show in for Oomi's touchscreen controller, two color-changing Lifx LEDs for the bulbs, a Nest Cam for the Oomi Cube and a Belkin WeMo Mini in place of Oomi's smart plug, the total cost would be about $560 -- and that's if you bought everything at full price.

""By piecemealing a system together, you don't get the simplicity that Oomi provides,"" counters Colin Marshall, vice president of Oomi's parent company Fantem. He also points to Oomi-specific features such as its compatibility with Z-Wave devices and the multitude of sensors packed into the Oomi Cube. It's a fair point to an extent, but it doesn't make the price tag any easier to swallow.

All of that said, I like Oomi, and think it could have been an interesting competitor to names such as SmartThings and Wink a couple of years ago. But today there are simply too many strong alternatives that cost less for most people to justify spending so much.

Oomi's starter kit ships out in a distinctive black box with gilded, Gucci-esque lettering. The first impression is a far cry from the plasticky white hardware of Wink and SmartThings -- by comparison, Oomi's weighty devices feel refined and maybe even a little bit haughty.

You'll start by plugging in the tablet's fancy, magnetic charging dock and powering it up. From there, it'll walk you through the setup process, which is one of the easiest I've ever experienced from a starter kit of this kind thanks to the NFC radios built into each device. Just tell the tablet you're adding something, then tap it against the gadget you want to add. There's no scanning, no temporary Wi-Fi networks to join and no access codes to enter. Just super simple setup by way of physical proximity. (I should point out that this makes for a system that's less vulnerable to outside hacks.)

Oomi's devices use a wireless language called Z-Wave to communicate with each other. The nice thing about that is that they don't rely on your home's Wi-Fi network for anything other than letting you connect with the system from afar. They'll still be able to talk to each other if your Wi-Fi goes down, and any automations you've programmed should continue to run like normal. Another benefit: You can connect a wide range of third-party Z-Wave devices with Oomi, most of which cost less than adding extra a-la-carte Oomi gear.

With your devices up and running and the tablet calling the shots, you can create an Oomi account and download the Oomi app to your phone to control things from there. One complaint about the app: You can view any automations you've programmed on the tablet (the lights turning on when motion is detected, for instance) and you can turn those automations on and off. But you can't edit those automations and you can't create new ones. You're forced to use the tablet for that.

At least that automation engine is well designed. In addition to selecting custom triggers and resulting actions for each automated rule, you can also set conditions -- rules that only run during certain times of day, for example. Those conditions give you the flexibility you need to customize those automations as you see fit. It's just a shame you can't do so from your phone.

The centerpiece of the setup isn't the tablet, though -- it's the Oomi Cube camera, which doubles as Oomi's Z-Wave hub. In addition to featuring night vision and letting you check the camera feed on the tablet or on your phone, it's also packed with sensors for things like light, motion and air quality, as well as a siren that'll sound if it spots movement while the system is armed. The camera's image quality wasn't quite as sharp as you'll get with the Nest Cam, however, and I noticed a persistent delay of about five seconds in my feed.

The Cube also uses its infrared light to communicate with audio-visual gear and television sets. That lets you link the physical buttons on the tablet with the physical buttons on, say, your TV remote. From there, the Cube will act as middleman, relaying those button presses on your tablet to the TV, and effectively letting you use it as a universal remote. Programming everything was easy when I connected Oomi with the Roku TV in the CNET Smart Apartment bedroom, but there was a noticeable delay when I tried pressing buttons as I tested it out. Your mileage may vary depending on your AV gear, but for me it's a feature I'd try once and then probably never use again.

The bulbs were better performers, reliably turning on and off and changing colors whenever I wanted. I appreciated that you can pick out a custom color pattern for each bulb to cycle through, but I wish that the colors themselves were a bit brighter. Still, they're perfectly decent smart bulbs, and a nice inclusion in the starter kit, since color-changing bulbs are typically smart home extras that you have to splurge on in and of themselves.

As for the plug, it did a fine job of turning a desk fan of mine on and off as needed. With a glowing ring of LEDs and a USB port on the side for charging devices, it's a smart, well-designed device.

Oomi also offers integrations with three notable smart home platforms: Nest, Philips Hue and Amazon's Alexa. The first two let you put third-party thermostats and lightbulbs under Oomi's control. As for Amazon, you can enable the Oomi skill in the Alexa app then ask the virtual voice assistant to run your preset scenes or turn devices on and off. I wasn't able to test it out, though -- the Oomi skill is still in beta, and not officially up and running just yet.

Oomi tries to do an awful lot -- security, automation, entertainment controls, color-changing light -- and some of those efforts are more successful than others. I love the use of NFC for easy pairing, and little details like the smart plug's USB charging port show that Oomi's creators put a lot of thought into their product. Other features, such as the universal remote functionality, feel a bit tacked on.

In the end, I just can't get past the price tag. At $700, Oomi needs to offer more than versatility for versatility's sake. As DIY, do-it-all smart home systems go, it's a very good one, but the asking price is tough to stomach. Unless you're willing to spend extra in order to unify your gadgets and automated rules within one app, I'd recommend shopping around for something less expensive."
This pricey smart thermostat promises 'perfect' indoor temps|"

HVAC manufacturer Lennox also sells a variety of air quality and heating and cooling accessories through its list of approved dealers. Their newest product, the iComfort E30, is a $360 touchscreen thermostat touting a variety of smart features. This model is currently only available in the US; $360 converts to roughly £275 and AU$455 at the current exchange rate.

First, and perhaps most importantly, you don't need a Lennox-brand HVAC system to operate the iComfort E30. The official press release says this thermostat will work with ""any brand of HVAC system,"" although it is also compatible with the Lennox iHarmony Zoning System.

The iComfort E30 also works with Amazon's Alexa-powered voice control speakers. While that shows Lennox understands the growing demand for smart home partnerships in everyday devices, many of today's connected thermostats work with more than one platform.

Honeywell on Wednesday added Google Home integration to its Lyric thermostats (prices start at $150), which already integrate with Alexa and Apple's Siri-based HomeKit software (Apple is expected to debut its own standalone smart speaker, the $349 HomePod, in December).

Nest's $249 Learning thermostat works with Alexa and Google Home and the Editors' Choice Award-winning $249 Ecobee4 thermostat integrates with a long list of platforms, including functioning as an Alexa speaker itself.

So why should anyone spend $360 on the iComfort E30, in addition to paying a dealer-assigned electrician for the installation?

The thermostat's ""Perfect Temp"" and ""Feels Like"" features sound intriguing. Essentially, they are supposed to consider the indoor and outdoor temperatures, as well as the indoor humidity to determine ideal heating and cooling settings for that particular day. Lennox can also supposedly track your home and away status using your phone's GPS and auto-adjust your heat and A/C accordingly. The iComfort E30 tracks outdoor air quality levels, too, and will turn on the fan automatically when pollen and other allergen levels are high.

I'm still not convinced this thermostat is worth its $360 price, but am curious if its ""Feels Like"" feature really can account for regular day-to-day temperature and humidity changes. We've requested a review unit, so stay tuned for our hands-on impressions."
Liftmaster thinks your garage needs a smart lock|"

Take a quick detour into the smart home aisle at your local hardware store and you're sure to see plenty of smart locks for your front door. But what about your garage? Doesn't the biggest, most visible door into your home deserve some consideration, too?

That's the thinking behind Liftmaster's newest product, an automatic garage door lock that promises to bring some peace of mind to the place where you park your car. Essentially just a big, automated deadbolt for your garage door, the Liftmaster lock works like any garage door lock, except for the fact that you can automate it to lock and unlock automatically, or control it remotely using a smart phone app.

Liftmaster's selling the lock through a network of dealers as part of its latest automated garage entry systems. Specifically, it's compatible with Liftmaster's Wi-Fi-enabled 8550W and 8360W openers, as well as the new 8587W. Prices will vary by dealer, but buying the lock packaged with one of those openers will set you back somewhere around $650 once installation is factored in. And no, the lock isn't available on its own.

All in all, that's a lot more than you'll spend on a retrofit smart garage opener like Garageio (about $200) or Liftmaster's own MyQ Garage (about $100). Neither of those will actually lock your garage door, though -- they only let you open and close it.

Adding a lock into that equation seems perfectly sensible to me, but it might be a hard purchase to justify when standard garage door locks typically don't cost much more than twenty bucks. Shop around, and you'll also find automated locks that you can install yourself for less than $100.

Adding an automated lock like that to a product like MyQ Garage and selling them as a bundle for more like $200 might have been a better approach, but it's clear Liftmaster is targeting the high-end market to start with. That may very well establish this lock as a smart garage status symbol, but it may also lock out a lot of DIY-minded customers who would have otherwise been receptive to Liftmaster's pitch.

The Automatic Garage Door Lock is available now through Liftmaster's network of dealers, which you can browse here."
Swidget might be the only smart outlet you'll ever need|"

Smart outlets aren't a new thing. We've seen everything from plug-in models like the Belkin Wemo Insight Switch to Insteon's in-wall On/Off Outlet. These simple, functional devices give you remote access to whatever you plug into them via your phone and voice commands.

Startup Swidget took the Insteon approach with its hardwired Swidget Outlet, available for preorder now on Kickstarter starting at $38 (roughly £30 and AU$50 converted). But instead of basic on-off outlet control, Swidget plans to offer modular inserts. A lot of modular inserts.

Here are some of the insert options Swidget has in the works:

The idea is that you'll be able to quickly and easily swap in one accessory for another with minimal effort. And, bonus: They'll be offered in both Wi-Fi and Z-Wave versions. The Wi-Fi attachments are designed to work directly with the related Swidget app, whereas you'll need a compatible hub for Z-Wave integration, such as SmartThings.

While this is a unique approach to a smart outlet, I'm not sold on Swidget. When the device is scheduled to ship to backers worldwide in June 2018, it will only come with the ""outlet control"" insert. The other inserts are expected to be sold separately after the campaign period ends. Swidget is also offering a developer kit for anyone interested in designing their own accessories.

But since outlet control is the bare minimum requirement for any smart outlet, it seems strange to not offer it natively as part of Swidget. In other words, if you decide to buy and use any other insert, you'd immediately lose the remote access feature. Swidget has 31 days remaining on its Kickstarter campaign and has raised over $50,000. Its original funding goal was $40,000.

Ring to make battery and solar-powered spotlight security cameras|"

Ring, the start-up behind the doorbell camera of the same name, has added an outdoor light/camera hybrid with multiple power options to its roster of Wi-Fi connected home security devices. The Ring Spotlight Cams will start at $199 and will be available in three versions: wired, battery-powered and solar-powered. You can preorder them in the US and Canada today, but only the wired version will ship in the next seven to 10 days; the battery- and solar-powered version won't ship until the fall.

All versions of the Spotlight Cams have built-in LED light panels that turn on when they detect motion, a 1080p HD camera and two-way audio so you can hear what's going on in front of your camera and can talk to whomever's nearby. The cameras have a 140-degree field of view. The solar-powered cam comes with a Ring Solar Panel to keep the battery pack charged.

The company said the Spotlight Cams, especially the battery and solar powered versions, will help owners add more outdoor cameras to their home security setup either or not you have the proper electrical setup. But the non-wired versions of the Spotlight Cams will cost you more: The solar option is $229, and you'll have to pay another $29 if you want an extra battery for the $199 battery-only version. However, the Spotlight Cam is still cheaper than Ring's Floodlight Cam, a similar hardwired light/camera combo that's $249."
Leviton Decora Smart Dimmer review:|"

The Leviton Decora DH6HD Dimmer Switch, Leviton's newest, looks and works just like a regular light switch, but it also works with Apple HomeKit, letting you control it remotely from Apple's Home app on your iPhone or by using a Siri command. At $50 (roughly converted to £38 or AU$63), it's also one of the more affordable options on the smart switch market.

It isn't perfect, though. The physical controls feel stiff, and only let you change between seven dimming settings. It also doesn't offer as many features as you'll find with other competing dimmers. Unlike those competitors, the DH6HD won't work with Alexa, Google Home, IFTTT or anything else besides HomeKit. Plus, it really isn't much to look at compared with those other smart switches.

If you're in the market for a simple smart switch -- or just a relatively cheap option that works with HomeKit -- then the DH6HD is worth a look. Just don't expect it to look or feel any fancier than it actually is.

Installing a smart switch usually isn't that much more complicated than installing a regular light switch -- just flip the breaker off, connect the wires (load, line, ground and neutral in Leviton's case), screw everything into place and turn the breaker back on.

In our case, the Leviton switch was too big to fit inside the wall at the CNET Smart Home, so I had to install a bigger gang box in order to get it to fit. I also had a hard time finding the neutral wire, which made installation take a little longer. These kinds of issues aren't specific to Leviton, and they will vary from home to home, but Leviton at least does a decent job of walking you through the install process with the included instructions, and with helpful video tutorials online.

Once the hardware is installed, you can use the Decora switch just like any other light switch, although it didn't make a great first impression. The button feels stiff and extra-clicky when you press it, there's a slight delay whenever you turn it on and off and the fades are a little choppy as you dim it up and down. Lighting purists especially will prefer a fancier smart switch that turns the lights on immediately, or at least one that has a smoother fade effect.

The dimmer is by far the worst part of the physical workings of the switch. Like the main switch, it also works like a button so there's not a whole lot of fine control when you're trying to dim the light. It should be noted that there is a Leviton Smart Switch that comes without a dimmer, but still has the same HomeKit capabilities. It's a few dollars cheaper and eliminates the stiff dimmer switch altogether.

While other switches have multicolored light bars or touchpad interfaces, the Leviton smart switch has only the on/off button with a dimmer on the side. While some may see this as too simple for a smart switch, it actually provides a lot of advantages.

With Leviton's traditional switch design, it's easy to know right out of the box which button does what. With HomeKit support built into the Leviton switch, you also don't need any additional hardware beyond your iOS device. The switch also works in three-way setups, so you can connect more than one switch to the same light. This is a feature that the more expensive WeMo switch doesn't have.

The Leviton switch uses Wi-Fi to connect directly with your router, so you don't need to connect it to a hub to control it with your phone. It won't work with Android devices, though -- and it won't work with Alexa, either. Leviton does sell other Decora switches that are compatible with Android and Alexa, but at that point you may as well pay the extra money for a smart switch like the Lutron Caseta that's compatible with everything.

Beyond those somewhat clunky physical controls, you can also control this light switch using the Leviton app on your phone. And, thanks to the HomeKit compatibility, you can control it using Apple's Home app for iOS devices, or by using a spoken Siri command.

To connect it to HomeKit, all you have to do is enter the eight digit number at the bottom-right corner of the switch in the Home app. Syncing the switch with HomeKit also allows you to use it alongside any other HomeKit-compatible gadget under your roof.

To connect it to the Leviton app, you have to scan for the device in the app until it connects. Leviton has multiple apps for its various products, which makes it hard to find the right one for this switch. Once I found and installed the correct one, the switch connected almost instantly. The app offers similar perks to HomeKit, such as controlling the dimness and turning on the light remotely, but it also allows you to control fade speed and adjust the switch's minimum or max brightness. You can also look at the specifics of each switch, such as the assigned name and the model number.

In both the Home app and the Leviton app, the software dimmer is smooth and allows for far better control than when you dim the lights by hand. When compared to Belkin WeMo and Lutron Caseta, the Decora smart switch's response time to voice commands was virtually identical, and the three apps offer similar slide controls and grouping mechanisms. They're all pretty similar, at least as far as basic smartphone controls go.

If you're looking for a modern-looking smart switch with plenty of connected features and third-party integrations, then you'll want to skip Leviton's Decora DH6HD in favor of a more fully-featured switch from a name like Belkin or Lutron. Unlike the DH6HD, both of those competitors will work with Alexa, as will the HS200 smart switch from TP-Link, which only costs $40.

Some might prefer Leviton's simplicity, as well as the focus on Apple HomeKit. The easy-to-use design and responsive app make up for the plain look and clunky physical controls. Connecting the switch to your phone and using the app is useful and intuitive, but the lack of compatibility with any other service outside of HomeKit puts some of that usefulness into question. As a baseline smart switch for HomeKit households, it does the job, but at $50, it'd be nice if it did a little more."
RoomMe lives with you, controls your smart gadgets for you|"

The smartest smart home would automatically inuit your every need -- no voice commands or apps required. Simply walking into a room would prompt an immediate response from your lights, thermostat and TV, to the exact settings you wanted. With the exception of select motion-activated automations, that doesn't really exist today.

Startup Intellithings promises to bridge that gap with RoomMe. RoomMe is a disk-shaped presence sensor that looks just like a smoke detector. Units are currently available via crowdfunding site Indiegogo starting at $139 (that's about £105 and AU$180, converted).

Here's the gist:

Step 1: Install one RoomMe sensor per room on the ceiling near the doorway. Two D batteries power one RoomMe (no wires needed); Intellithings says they should last up to three years before needing to be replaced.

This immediately gave me pause, because, like the Lucis Nubryte camera-light control combo device, who wants to install something like this in every room?

Step 2: Download the RoomMe app for Android or iPhone and tell it what smart devices you have, as well as what room they're in.

This is where you can set preferences, such as, ""When I walk into my bedroom at 11 p.m. dim my Lifx bulbs to 40 percent and adjust my Nest thermostat to 68 degrees.""

Step 3: As long as you have your phone in tow, the RoomMe sensor will let the app know what room you're in via presence detection -- and adjust your smart devices based on your preferences via Bluetooth.

I imagine RoomMe would work best for automations you tend to do habitually. If your schedule is always varied, this sort of setup would probably be more annoying than helpful. You should be able to prioritize whose settings RoomMe chooses and sticks with, though, even if multiple people with their own configurations are present. And if you walk into your bedroom at 11 a.m. Intellithings says it will react differently than it would at 11 p.m.

Intellithings' Indiegogo page lists a wide range of smart home partners for RoomMe, including Apple HomeKit, Samsung SmartThings, Wink, Belkin WeMo and Nest. Units are expected to ship to backers everywhere in May 2018.

I'm equal parts skeptical about this product and intrigued by the idea of not having to use voice commands or apps to actively control smart products. If it works, RoomMe could be really useful, particularly as assistive technology for individuals with disabilities. We'll just have to wait and see."
Mistbox mini sprinkler system cools down your tired AC unit|"

The summer months are tough on air conditioners. Not only is your thermostat's set temperature likely lower because of the blistering heat, your outside AC unit has to use more energy to cool that warmer-than-average ambient air to that lower-than-average indoor temperature. As a result, you end up paying significantly more on your electric bill.

Mistbox wants to make the warmest months of the year a bit more bearable with version 2.0 of its energy-saving smart device. Mistbox 2.0 is designed to reduce the air temperature around your AC unit by gently spraying water whenever its built-in sensors and the weather forecast tell it to.

Available for preorder now on Kickstarter, the second-gen Mistbox offers some key upgrades over its predecessor. It still connects to your outside AC unit, and you'll find similar sprinkler attachments that mist water from your garden hose, but the Mistbox 2.0 now operates via wind power rather than solar energy.

Specifically, it comes with a small wind turbine attachment that relies on exhaust air from the unit's condenser fan for power. This is a smart update because you can depend on the fan's exhaust rather than worrying whether your Mistbox is getting enough sunlight. (Outside AC units consist of a compressor, a condenser and a secondary fan.)

The new Mistbox also uses cellular data instead of Wi-Fi. Partly because of this, Mistbox has changed its payment system to a subscription service. I'm not a fan of monthly subscription fees, but a cellular network makes sense in this case. I installed and began testing the original Mistbox unit at my house more than a year ago, only to run into a series of errors during the Wi-Fi configuration stage. I'm guessing my router just wasn't close enough to the spot where my outside AC unit is located.

Mistbox says it's done more to treat the water that's sprayed around your AC unit with the second version of the gadget. Apparently, untreated water can damage your cooling system with harmful bacteria and other allergens.

In addition to these major changes, Mistbox 2.0's design looks a lot better at a glance. That might not matter much, since it's going to be installed outside on your AC unit, but it could also translate to improved ease of use. We'll just have to see for ourselves.

Mistbox has raised over $180,000 so far on Kickstarter; its original funding goal was just $10,000. Units are expected to ship internationally in August starting at $89 for a prepaid year-long subscription (that converts to about £70 or AU$115) -- or for $399 to purchase it outright (plus a $49 subscription fee; $349 converts to £270 or AU$455).

After the crowdfunding campaign ends, Mistbox devices will be available for purchase starting at $10 per month. Non-Kickstarter customers can also opt for a $99 prepaid annual subscription. A $39 activation fee will apply to all purchases as well, unless you preorder via Kickstarter."
Xfinity Home review:|"

Comcast's Xfinity Home Secure service changed how I think about smart home devices.

That might seem odd, that something primarily billed as a home security service would change an opinion on home automation tech, but to be honest, up until I signed on to do this review I didn't care much about adding connected gear to my house.

My plain ol' dumb lights and thermostats worked just fine after all, and the thought of opening different apps to control different systems seemed like an unnecessary hassle. For home security, my needs were being met, for the most part, by the SimpliSafe system I'd installed. What Xfinity Home showed me, however, was how smart home devices make much more sense when fully integrated with the sensors and cameras of a home security system.

Xfinity's offerings aren't vastly different from what you'll find from other providers like AT&T and ADT or even do-it-yourself options like Frontpoint and Protect America. One big difference is that you can combine Comcast's devices for security and home automation with any of its growing list of supported third-party devices -- with no extra charges for using them -- and control them with the Xfinity Home mobile app, web portal or even your TV if you have Xfinity TV and an X1 DVR.

Just to be clear, I was already an Xfinity Internet and TV subscriber, but you don't need to be either to use Xfinity Home. You do need high-speed internet access, but it doesn't need to be Xfinity. Also, while I normally use my own Arris/Motorola modem and Netgear wireless router, for this review I used Comcast's gateway.

Unlike its competitors, Comcast doesn't have tiers of service for Home Secure. You sign up for a 24-month contract priced at $39.99 a month. At the time of this review, Comcast was offering new subscribers service for $24.99 per month for 24 months with free installation, after which it would increase to $39.99.

The price includes professional 24/7 security monitoring with direct access to call for police, firefighters or an ambulance and a little hardware to get you started: three door/window sensors, a motion sensor, a touchscreen controller and a wireless keypad.

The sensors are completely wireless, but should your web connection go down or you lose power, it has 3G wireless and a battery backup. If you have a previously installed alarm system (I had wired motion sensors still in place from an old ADT system, for example), Xfinity can potentially take over those sensors and use them for your new setup to save you some money.

The starter set might be enough for an apartment or a townhouse, but for anything larger you should expect to buy more sensors, which can drive up costs quickly. And if you want cameras for live video monitoring, those cost extra, too.

At the time of this review Comcast's indoor/outdoor cameras were priced at $99 each, but to get that price requires an additional $9.99 per month, per-camera service fee for 24/7 video recording with 10 days of storage. This will also let you cut clips to download and share. Otherwise, you can pay $200 for each camera, which gets you live round-the-clock monitoring and the ability to capture clips and photos.

Along with the security sensors and camera, Comcast has its own Zen thermostat and an outlet controller for lights or small appliances you want to remotely control. I didn't test the latter, but the thermostat was easy to install, works well and looks good to boot (though it did occasionally tell me it was -558 degrees Fahrenheit in my house and require a quick reboot to fix). It'll even recommend heating/cooling schedules based on your local weather patterns.

Already have a Nest thermostat or Lutron outlet dimmers? Then there's no need to buy Comcast's gear. This again is Xfinity Home's edge: It works with a large and growing list of third-party devices that you can control and automate from one interface.

Linking devices to the Xfinity Home service takes little more than adding your account logins for your individual smart devices into the Xfinity Home mobile app. Once they're synced, you can use the app to set up rules for home automation.

In the app you can set up actions like having a porch light come on at sunset and turn off at sunrise. Or have a camera capture a video clip when a door is opened or motion is detected. At the moment, though, most actions are for lighting, motion and door/window sensors, the cameras and Nest thermostats.

For example, while you're able to easily program a timed temperature schedule through the app, you can also create a rule that will automatically adjust the temperature to an Away mode and also shut off all your lights to save energy -- all with a single tap. You can also easily have connected lights turn on and off around your home to give the appearance of activity while you're away.

However, if you have a Chamberlain MyQ remote garage door opener connected, you can use the app to open and close your garage and set it to send push notifications when those happen. But that's it. Well, for now anyway. Comcast promises more rules are on the way and even in the three months that I tested the service, new rules and support for new products have come onboard. That said, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't create automations similar to those available with AT&T's Digital Life.

The Xfinity Home app is well laid out and easy to navigate and is likely the main way you'll control your system, but certainly not the only way. The included wireless keypad lets you arm and disarm your system and send an alarm to local authorities, while the touchscreen control center (not wireless) lets you do those things as well as adjust your thermostat, check the activity and status of all the sensors in your home, view live video from your cameras and even check the weather.

There's also a web portal, which pretty much duplicates what you can do with app -- from monitoring your cameras to setting up rules to arming/disarming your system. Lastly, for Xfinity TV subscribers with an X1 DVR, you can view and control your setup through your TV using voice commands. Saying ""Xfinity Home cameras"" will bring up the live views from your cameras, for instance.

What is missing is support for digital assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. So if being able to say, disarm your system by talking to your Amazon Echo is a must-have feature, you'll have to go elsewhere.

Like I said at the start, Xfinity Home has me rethinking the value of smart home devices. Putting them and professional security under one service makes having both more valuable. Although what it can do right now might not compare to what others offer and startup costs can get pricey, Comcast's monthly costs are competitive. Plus, with growing support for third-party devices that you can integrate now or later, Xfinity Home makes it easier to build out the system you need."
Ring Video Doorbell 2 review:|"

Ring's Video Doorbell 2 isn't my all-time favorite smart buzzer -- that'd be the SkyBell HD (mainly because it offers free cloud storage of your recorded video; every one else charges for that). But you have to hardwire SkyBell for it to work; the Ring 2 runs on wires or a rechargeable lithium ion battery. The ability to install this doorbell pretty much anywhere, no wires needed, is a huge selling point. Bonus: Unlike Ring's original battery-powered buzzer, you don't have to remove the entire Video Doorbell 2 when it's time to charge -- just take out the battery.

It performs well, too. Expect prompt alerts whenever a visitor rings the doorbell, or if its built-in motion sensor detects nearby activity. Ring's partnerships with Amazon's Alexa, IFTTT and Wink also don't hurt. If you want a battery-powered smart doorbell, the Ring 2 is the right answer. Otherwise, take a look at SkyBell, the August Doorbell Cam or Ring's Video Doorbell Pro.

Check out the chart below for details on how the Video Doorbell 2 compares to other smart buzzers.

Every smart doorbell I've tested has at least one unique feature. For the Video Doorbell 2, it's the removable, rechargeable battery. For Ring's Video Doorbell Pro, it's the narrow doorframe-friendly design. The SkyBell HD offers free cloud storage -- and August's Doorbell Cam integrates seamlessly with other August products, like its HomeKit-enabled Smart Lock.

While I wish Ring offered some sort of entry-level free cloud video storage option, I really like that every Video Doorbell 2 purchase comes with easy-to-remove face plates in different color finishes: satin nickel and venetian. Its smart home partnerships with Amazon Alexa via the Echo Show, IFTTT and Wink also add appeal.

Say, ""Alexa, show me the front door"" to pull up a live video feed on the Amazon Echo Show's screen.

IFTTT is a free web- and app-based service that lets you connect your Ring Video Doorbell 2 to other smart home devices, like Philips Hue LEDs so that ""If someone rings your doorbell, then your Philips Hue bulbs will flash.""

Wink helps to consolidate your connected home devices to one hub and one app. Pair the Video Doorbell 2 to Wink so you can view your live feed alongside other smart products.

Ring makes the Video Doorbell 2's configuration extremely simple. Download the Ring app on your Android or iOS device, create an account (if you don't already have one from an existing Ring product), and follow the instructions to set up your smart doorbell.

Note: You can either hardwire the Video Doorbell 2 or rely on the included battery for power. You'll still have to install the battery even if you opt for hardwiring, but you won't have to mess with electrical wiring at all if you only use the battery.

Always consult a professional if you have installation questions, particularly if you're replacing a hardwired buzzer with your new Ring. This process took me roughly 15 minutes from start to finish, though. It helped that I was able to use existing holes from previous installations to mount the doorbell's base plate. A battery-powered installation should take even less time, assuming you also don't have to break out the power drill to create new mounting holes.

Once the doorbell's installed, the app will prompt you to name your doorbell -- the CNET Smart Home review unit is called ""Front Door."" Connect to the Video Doorbell 2's Wi-Fi module and then enter the credentials for your local Wi-Fi network. This process is standard for many of the Wi-Fi home security devices we test, but Ring makes it especially easy with little pop-up alerts that let you know you're on the right track.

For instance, a notification will appear on your phone to let you know you've connected to Ring's Wi-Fi module and that you can now return to the app (see the screenshot to the right).

Once your Ring Video Doorbell 2 is installed and configured, you can start using it right away. Pull up the live feed whenever you want, or when the app sends you an activity alert. From there, you can even talk to visitors via the buzzer's built-in microphone and speaker. The app also allows for scheduling and motion zones so you can customize how and when you receive these alerts.

Note: Performance will vary based on the quality of your Wi-Fi network.

Even so, this model worked quite well for me, delivering prompt alerts and (mostly) crisp live video feeds. The free 30-day trial of Ring's cloud service also gave me a chance to review and download saved clips to my phone.

But the Video Doorbell 2's main value is definitely its removable, rechargeable lithium ion battery. If battery power isn't a priority, you should consider other buzzers, particularly the fee-free hardwired SkyBell HD."
Nest Cam IQ review:|"

The $299/£299 Nest Cam IQ is unquestionably smart, but I can't recommend it as readily as Nest's other security cameras. My main reason? Price.

Like the $199/£159 Nest Cam Indoor and Outdoor, the indoor-only IQ has 1080p HD livestreaming, a 130-degree field of view and advanced motion-sensing smarts. It also relies on the same Nest app and works with the same smart home partners.

The IQ's key differences are improved two-way audio and a larger 8-megapixel, 4K image sensor. The 4K sensor allows for 12x digital zoom and a free, IQ-exclusive feature called Supersight that focuses in on faces for an up-close look at who's in your house.

While the IQ has more advanced specs and features than any Nest cam to date, I'm not sold on its value. If you don't mind paying more for this specced-out camera, go for it -- you will see a little more detail in the live feed. Regular ol' 1080p (without a 4K sensor) will likely do the trick for most, though.

Follow these steps to get your Nest Cam up and running:

Many of these steps are optional, but enabling them all gives you full access to your Nest Cam's features. Providing your address, for instance, allows the software to track whether you and the rest of your family are home or away. This initial configuration process should take only a couple of minutes.

Now you're in your Nest app, but your camera hasn't been connected just yet. Here are the next steps for getting your Nest Cam IQ connected to your local Wi-Fi network:

This may seem like a lot of steps, but most of them are very straightforward. The whole process should take less than 10 minutes, assuming your Wi-Fi network is strong and connects easily. Note: Always confirm the strength of your Wi-Fi connection where you plan to install your camera; a sluggish network can inhibit the live feed and other important features.

Create an account -- download the Nest app for Android, iPhone or the webEnable notifications -- opt-in for real-time alerts when motion activity takes placeName your house -- give your house a name; ours is the CNET Smart HomeEnter your address -- provide the address where your IQ is installed Allow Home/Away Assist -- give the Nest app permission to use your phone's locationSign up for Family Accounts -- create individual Nest accounts for every family member

Select ""Add"" on the app's home screen Click ""OK"" when the app asks to access your cameraScan the QR code on the bottom of the camera from the Nest appTell the Nest app where you're installing your IQ -- our CNET Smart Home camera is in the living roomPlug in the camera with the included power adapter; the app will automatically begin searching for the cameraSelect your Wi-Fi network from the provided list and enter your password; your camera is now onlineOpt-in to Nest's Familiar Face Alerts feature (optional, and only available for Nest Aware subscribers)

Now that your Nest Cam IQ is online, you can go straight to viewing the live feed and enjoying free 30-day access to Nest's cloud subscription service, Nest Aware. Nest Aware is a contract-free service that costs $10 per month for 10 days of continuous video storage or $30 per month for 30 days of continuous video storage. (It's £8 or £24 in the UK respectively.) Learn more about Nest Aware here.

Nest Cam Indoor and Outdoor customers have to pay for Nest Aware to get access to features like Person Alerts, a type of notification that tells you when it sees a person (but not who it sees). Nest Cam IQ customers get this feature for free, as well as the IQ-exclusive Supersight. Supersight harnesses the IQ's powerful 4K image sensor, 12x digital zoom, as well as HDR (high dynamic range, for improved picture clarity) to track faces around a room.

Both Person Alerts and Supersight worked quite well, letting me know it spotted someone and zooming in on their face so I could ID them. If these two features are particularly important to you, the Nest Cam IQ's value improves slightly (since you don't have to pay for Nest Aware to access them). But, you'd still have to pay for Nest Aware if you want to review saved video footage. Note: Nest now offers all Nest customers 3 free hours of event history, but saved as snapshots of activity, rather than video clips.

And, like Nest's other cameras, the IQ works with IFTTT, Nest's own Works with Nest platform, and Amazon Alexa (soon). Check out my post on viewing security camera feeds from the Amazon Echo Show for more details on the Alexa integration.

All of these features worked well during my testing, but three improvements stood out the most. First, you can see more detail than ever before with the IQ's 4K image sensor, including facial features that were previously fuzzy. Enabling Supersight, also called ""Close-up tracking view"" in the Nest app's settings, allows the camera to zoom in on motion to capture a close-up view of a person's face.

Two-way talk is easier now, too, thanks to Nest's speaker upgrade; carry on a conversation with a family member remotely -- or tell your puppy to stop chewing on your shoes.

The biggest upgrade, though, is Nest's new Familiar Face Alerts feature. Note: Familiar Face Alerts are only available on IQ cameras with a Nest Aware subscription.

Familiar Face Alerts help you distinguish between friends and family -- and everyone else -- through an image database. When it detects a face, you can say whether or not you recognize the person to help train the system and improve its detection capabilities over time.

The $299/£299 Nest Cam IQ is a solid camera with an equally solid app interface for accessing the live feed and making adjustments to features. But at 100 bucks more than Nest's indoor and outdoor cameras, the IQ strikes me as prohibitively expensive.

That's especially true when you take a closer look at the features it adds. Yes, your live feed will have a bit more clarity, and you'll have free access to Person Alerts and Supersight. But are these features necessary for the regular DIYer who wants some security benefits, but is mainly checking in to see what their dog gets up to during the day? Probably not.

The Nest Cam IQ has potential, but it just isn't quite worth the cost for most buyers today. Bump the price down, though, and Nest might really have something."
Halo+ Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm review:|"

By adding weather alerts to a smart smoke protector, the Halo+ skirts a fine line between useful innovation and annoying add-on. Fortunately, the first product from startup Halo Smart Labs implements the feature well enough to land on the good side of that line.

The $130 Halo+ Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Weather Alerts does all of the basics you'd expect of a smart smoke detector, and it thankfully adds weather alerts with enough customization that they're more helpful than bothersome. The $100 Nest Protect is still the best smart smoke detector out there, but the Halo+ is a worthy competitor that I'd recommend if you live in an area with dangerous weather -- especially if you like turning your phone off at night.

You might be wondering why on earth you'd need your smoke alarm to tell you that it's raining out, especially since you have a smartphone and a pair of eyes. Rest assured, the alarm won't start blaring at full volume every time it sprinkles.

Install the alarm -- it's hardwired with a battery backup -- and you'll use the iOS or Android app to connect it to your Wi-Fi. During setup, you'll choose which weather events you want to be notified of, and you can make changes in the future as you see fit.

I appreciated the level of detail in the setup, as you can even decide that you don't care about a tornado watch, but if it gets to be a tornado warning, then you'd like to know. Check out the picture above for all of your options.

When the weather does get dangerous, the alarm still won't start blaring. Instead, Halo+ tells you what's going on with a voice alert and tunes to the local weather station of your choice. I like the feature as a natural extension of the smoke detector as a safety device. Yes, it's somewhat redundant with the emergency notifications on your smartphone, but with Halo+ you can rest easy if you want to turn your phone off at night.

If you just want a smart smoke detector without weather alerts, you can buy the Halo Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm (without the plus and thus without the weather feature) for $100. Both the Halo and the $130 Halo+ are available on the company's site, as well as Home Depot, and Lowe's. Both products are US-only for now.

In addition to giving you an audible warning in the event of a hurricane or a flood, the Halo+ is certified as both a smoke and carbon monoxide detector (specifically, it conforms to UL standards 217 and 2034).

Halo uses both an ionization detector and a photoelectric sensor to detect smoke. Head here for a detailed breakdown of how those two sensors work. In brief, Halo combines a quick trigger alarm with a slower, smarter alarm.

The Halo+ combines the two to good effect -- it reliably picked up smoke quickly in our tests. We used smoke candles and an ordinary First Alert hardwired alarm for comparison. The First Alert detector sounded its alarm first every time, but the Halo+ was never more than a couple of seconds behind. That test lined up with our results from the Nest Protect.

The Halo+ even delivered its push notifications slightly faster than the Nest Protect did. The exact speed of the alerts will depend on your internet connection, but during our testing, Halo+ delivered it's alerts immediately after the alarm itself started to sound. The Nest Protect took a couple of extra seconds.

In both its push alerts and its audible warnings, Halo differentiates between a little smoke and a lot of smoke. As with weather notifications, the Halo+ will tell you what's wrong with a voice notification and tell you the location of the sounding alarm as well. We assigned ours to the basement, so the alarm told us it smelled smoke in the basement, then started the traditional smoke alarm siren.

As the alarm sounds, the built-in accent light flashes as well -- amber in the case of a little smoke, red for a lot of smoke or carbon monoxide, and blue in the case of a weather event.

Using the app, you can silence the alarm, but the Halo+ has a safeguard built-in stopping you from doing this if it detects a lot of smoke. You also have to be in sight of the alarm to silence it, as the alarm's light changes color three times, and the app asks you to identify each new color before it'll shut up. In practice, I'd like to be able to silence the alarm a little more quickly, but I appreciate the caution Halo takes with the feature.

Outside of an emergency, you can use the app to test the detector, check the battery, and see a log of recent alarm activity. You can also change the color and brightness of the accent light. The light offers a couple of timers so you can set it to turn off after 15 or 30 minutes, and it has effects called ""Party Mode"" and ""Rainbow"" which change its color quickly or slowly.

I highly doubt Halo's Party Mode will get much use beyond showing it off as a novelty when you first buy it. I'd much rather have Nest Protect's feature where the light turns on when you pass under it at night. Aside from those unnecessary but harmless extras, I liked the accent light and found the app easy to use.

The Nest Protect gains a significant edge over the Halo+ if you want to include it as part of a larger smart home setup. First and foremost, the Protect works with other Nest products like the Nest Cam so you can automatically record the action when the alarm sounds.

The Protect also works with online rule-maker IFTTT, allowing you to set up recipes tying the Protect to a wide range of smart home products. For example, you can flash your smart lights in an emergency. Beyond that, the Protect has a host of other integrations, thanks to Nest's widespread smart-home platform called Works with Nest.

Thankfully, Halo didn't come to the smart home empty handed. You can test your alarm or change the color of the accent light with your voice by way of Amazon's digital assistant Alexa (unfortunately, you can't silence the alarm with a voice command). Activate the Alexa skill, and you can control your Halo+ with a voice command to Amazon's always-listening speaker, the Amazon Echo.

You can also connect Halo to larger smart-home setups with IFTTT, SmartThings and Lowe's Iris. Similar to the Protect's connection with IFTTT, you can set up rules with SmartThings, Iris or IFTTT to flash compatible bulbs when your alarm sounds.

Granted, the most unique feature of the $130 Halo+ is a redundant one with any ordinary smartphone, but if you live in an area that's prone to inclement weather, I'd still call the weather alerts handy. Plus, the feature is well implemented and the Halo+ otherwise gets the basics right. Go with the Nest Protect if you're just interested in smart smoke detection, but if you want your smoke alarm to help you keep an eye on the sky, the Halo+ is worth your consideration."
Amazon Echo Show review:|"

Editor's note (October 26, 2017): Since introducing the Show in June 2017, Amazon has evolved its lineup of Echo smart speakers, refreshing some older models and continuing to expand Alexa's skills, support new third-party integrations and release special features like free domestic calling. Though the competition has stiffened, neither the Google Home Max nor the forthcoming Apple HomePod have a display, leaving this experimental ground wholly to Amazon -- for now. In fact, Amazon's own Echo Spot is the Show's closest competitor, combining elements of the Dot with the Show's visual capabilities. It's due out in December 2017.

The original Amazon Echo Show review, originally published in June 2017, follows below.

""Alexa, what can you show me?""

That's the first thing I asked the touchscreen-equipped Amazon Echo Show, the online retail giant's newest and, at $230 or £200, most expensive Alexa gadget. ""There's a lot,"" Alexa exclaimed, inasmuch as a mostly monotone AI assistant can exclaim anything.

She can show movie trailers, she went on to tell me. She can show the weather, or the items on a to-do list. She can show the lyrics as she streams music. She can show your options as you shop for stuff on Amazon. She can show YouTube videos and movies from Amazon Prime Video. She can show you pictures of your loved ones, or connect you with them directly via video chat. All you have to do is ask.

All of that comes in addition to Alexa's existing capabilities for things like voice-activated alarms, timers, traffic, fact checking, bad jokes and smart home controls, not to mention the thousands of third-party ""skills"" that each let her do something new once you enable them. She's always been a likable over-achiever, and the Echo Show doesn't change that.

But how much does the Echo Show build upon it? If you're already happy with Skype or FaceTime, then video chat alone might not be enough. Third party skills might help, as they certainly did with the original Echo smart speaker, but Amazon needs to lead the charge -- and in a lot of cases during my time with the Echo Show, the touchscreen didn't add anything to the Alexa experience.

The Echo Show has an awful lot of potential, and with slightly better sound than the touchscreen-free Echo, it assumes its place as the fanciest Alexa gadget yet. Still, its ultimate success will largely depend on what outside developers -- and Amazon itself -- choose to do with it as the software library matures. In other words, there's room for the Echo Show to grow, but unless you're dying to try those voice-activated video calls, waiting for Amazon to show us more before buying in seems like the best bet.

The big, central question with the Echo Show is whether or not the new touchscreen really adds anything to the Alexa experience. The answer depends on how you plan to use it.

To me, the biggest draw is hands-free, voice-activated video calls with other Alexa users. To opt in, you'll register your phone number with your Amazon account in the Alexa app. Alexa will then scan the contacts in your phone, and if she sees any contacts with numbers from Amazon's database, she'll add them to the list of people you can ask her to call or message. If that contact has an Echo Show, or if they're answering using the Alexa app on their phone, you can video chat with them, FaceTime-style.

And yes, you can block unwanted callers, a feature Amazon foolishly forgot about when it first introduced calls and messages for the Echo and Echo Dot.

The end result is essentially a private home phone server populated only with people you want to talk to -- no telemarketers, survey takers or bill collectors. It's not a proper phone, so you can't use your Echo Show to call the police or the dry cleaner across town, but it's still an interesting idea at a time when fewer and fewer people are using landlines. This is especially true for fans of FaceTime who enjoy video chatting with friends and family -- I'll bet they'd enjoy the Echo Show's hands-free approach quite a bit.

Many of those FaceTime fans are probably parents and grandparents, and if you've watched any of the Echo Show's promo ads, then you know that Amazon is targeting that demographic pretty aggressively. Sure enough, with its large-sized font and gentle suggestions for Alexa commands on nearly every screen, the Echo Show is Amazon's most senior-friendly Alexa gadget yet.

That brings us right to Alexa's new ""Drop In"" feature. Enable it, and you'll be able to authorize specific contacts to peep in on your camera feed regardless of whether or not you actually pick up the call. When they do, they'll see a blurred feed for the first 10 seconds, during which you have the option of disabling the camera or rejecting the call outright. You'll also see a notification on screen whenever someone is actively viewing your feed. The feature pairs with a motion sensor in the Echo Show itself that -- again, when authorized -- lets your contacts know when it senses you nearby. Seems a bit creepy, but it also sounds like a pretty sensible way of keeping an eye on an aging relative.

At any rate, targeting older users with a camera-centric feature might make more sense than you'd expect. A recent SafeHome survey on tech-related privacy concerns found that respondents aged 65 and up were less bothered by security cameras than any other category polled, including fitness trackers, TV sets and even antivirus software.

On that front, another of the Echo Show's big draws is support for smart home video cameras that let you check out your camera's feed on the screen with a simple Alexa command.

I tested this out in the CNET Smart Home by enabling the Nest Cam skill in the Alexa app, then asking Alexa to show me the video feed from the CNET Smart Apartment 20 miles across town. It worked perfectly, and makes for a pretty compelling feature if you're security-minded, or if you just want to use the Echo Show as a voice-activated baby monitor. Along with Nest, cameras from big names like Ring, August, Logitech and Netgear Arlo are already supported, and more are certain to follow suit.

Other use cases for that touchscreen are more niche, and less compelling as a result. You can see your options when you ask Alexa to add something to your Amazon shopping cart -- but voice shopping has never been Alexa's most interesting skill, no matter how much Amazon wants it to be. You can see the details of your local forecast when you ask Alexa for a weather update -- but seeing a forecast on a screen just duplicates a feature we already have on our phones.

Video playback on the Echo Show feels a little superfluous, too. Sure, I can imagine scenarios where voice-activated YouTube access makes sense -- say, in the kitchen, where you might want to pull up a recipe video while you're busy chopping onions. For the most part, though, I think a phone or a tablet would suffice.

In the end, the touchscreen's limitations seem to stem from uninspired design on Amazon's part. Some of that design feels downright lazy. For instance, when I told Alexa to ""show me pictures of cats,"" she showed me just a single picture of a cat. When I told her to ""show me more,"" she replied, ""I'm not quite sure how to help with that.""

The bigger issue to me is that the Echo Show could have been an opportunity for Amazon to flesh out Alexa's personality with clever, stylized visuals accompanying her spoken responses. Instead, we get a bland, barebones display that doesn't do much of anything to bring Alexa to life.

Take smart home control. Like with other Alexa products, you can ask the Echo Show to dim compatible smart lights up and down. When I asked her to set the lights in the CNET Smart Home kitchen to 70 percent, she was happy to oblige -- but the screen didn't change at all. I was expecting to see an animation of a light bulb illuminating, or perhaps a slider on screen dialing up to 70 that I could then touch to make an additional adjustment up or down. Nope, nothing of the sort.

Alexa's kid-friendly collection of terrible jokes is another missed opportunity for the display. She'll still gladly tell you a corny joke, but when she does, the screen won't display anything but the text of her response. Call up an easter egg from her long list of easter egg responses (i.e. ""Alexa, may the force be with you""), and she'll add in some monochromatic, nonanimated clipart of fireworks above the text. Yawn.

Perhaps Amazon is just being cautious here and waiting to see which touchscreen-optimized Alexa skills really click with customers before committing to a stylistic direction. The problem? Aside from the smart home camera feeds, only a handful of the more-than-10,000 Alexa skills will actually put the touchscreen to use at the time of Echo Show's launch. Here's all of them:

That list is likely to grow pretty fast, especially for touchscreen-familiar services with existing Alexa skills -- they've already got the voice control part of development done and out of the way. On the other hand, I polled my smart home contacts from Alexa-friendly companies like Philips, Lifx, Lutron, Wink and more -- none of them would confirm that they had a touchscreen-optimized Alexa skill in development.

Amazon could have primed the pump here by developing a couple of showy new touchscreen skills of its own. For my money, the most obvious would have been a karaoke skill that takes advantage of Alexa's new ability to display lyrics as you stream music. Amazon designed no such skill, however, and while I'm certain that some third-party developer ultimately will, it's still another missed opportunity.

As for the product itself, the Echo Show sheds the curves and cylindrical designs of the Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Look camera in favor an angular, blockier build. If you ignore the three buttons up top (volume up, volume down and a mute button that turns Alexa off), it looks a little like a mini rear-projection TV for your kitchen counter.

Reactions to the design were mixed when I polled my colleagues. Some appreciated the sturdy, simple build, but others, including myself, found it to be a bit dated-looking. The 7-inch screen is big enough for the job at hand (and slightly bigger than the screen on an iPhone 7 Plus), but the double bezel around the edges and the bulky body surrounding it both make it feel smaller than it actually is.

My biggest complaint with the design is that you can't adjust the angle of the touchscreen or the camera, which is less than ideal for what's essentially a modern-day video phone. Even something simple, like the adjustable feet you'll find on the bottom of a keyboard would have been nice here -- instead, you're stuck squeezing something underneath to prop it forward or backwards.

The sound quality, on the other hand, was surprisingly strong -- and, to my ear, noticeably better than the Amazon Echo, which has a habit of distorting bass just a bit at high volumes. By comparison, the Echo Show puts out clean, rich bass, thanks in no small part to the pair of Dolby speakers hidden inside. My colleague David Carnoy agreed that the Echo Show is a sonic step forward for Amazon -- though he also pointed out that those Dolby speakers are too close together to provide meaningful stereo sound unless you're unrealistically close to the device. At any rate, it certainly sounds good enough for casual listening, or, heck, even a small-sized house party.

The iPod and the iPhone showed us how an audiocentric gadget can evolve into something exponentially more significant -- and perhaps Amazon is trying to bottle some of that same lightning with the Echo Show. But, new video call functionality aside, the surprisingly uninspired touchscreen feels less like an evolution than a lateral move. For all of the things Alexa showed me, I wish I had seen more of a vision.

That's not to say that Amazon's $230/£200 touchscreen speaker isn't an intriguing device. Far from a swing and a miss, it might just be a hit, if early indications of strong preorder sales are accurate. But unless you think you'd put that video calling feature to regular use, I think it's worth waiting to see what else Amazon and its army of outside developers can show us before you buy in.

The Flic Hub adds more power to the smart button|"

The smart button is one of the simplest ways to personalize how you control your home. Essentially, you can connect a simple Bluetooth-enabled button to any gadget around the house. Then whenever you want to turn on the lights, skip to the next song on your sound system, or even send a text message, you can press a button to issue the command.

While that might seem unnecessary, the idea is, for $25 per button, you can streamline common tasks, saving 20 or 30 seconds many times per day. The payoff comes in the long run.

The problem with smart buttons is their Bluetooth connection: they require a nearby phone to bridge the gap between them and the Wi-Fi-connected devices they control. But Shortcut Labs, the developer behind the Flic smart button, which is one of the best Bluetooth buttons on the market, is releasing a smart hub that'll cut out the need for a phone.

The Flic Hub will cost $100 (although Indiegogo will let early crowd-funders preorder it for $50). While it will make Flic buttons better than before, the hub's price tag feels a little high, especially for a product that depends on its identity as an affordable entry point to the connected home.

The Hub isn't the first of its type (see the Logitech Pop button), but it is a helpful supplement to the standalone Bluetooth button. The buttons will retain their IFTTT-compatibility and dozens of integrations, but the hub will also mean your phone won't have to be around to use them -- offering multiple user control. If the hub works well, and users have a number of buttons already, then it might be useful. But if you don't already own multiple Flic buttons, then you probably shouldn't spend $100 on the hub."
Amazon Dash Wand review:|"

Amazon's newest gadget is a battery-powered, voice-enabled grocery scanner called the Dash Wand. Point it at a barcode and press the button to add that item to your Amazon shopping cart when you're running low, or press and hold to ask Alexa to add it. She'll even talk back to you through the scanner's tiny speaker.

The Amazon Dash Wand arrives just as the megaretailer is completing its $13.7 billion-dollar acquisition of Whole Foods, so it's clear that Amazon sees huge potential in disrupting people's grocery habits and making it as easy as possible to buy everything online.

To that end, the Dash Wand is a success -- it's easy to use, it works reliably, and it only costs $20. Add in the fact that Amazon throws in a $20 shopping credit and three months of free AmazonFresh Pickup (normally $15 per month), and the Dash Wand can pay for itself and then some. Seems fair for a gadget that's designed to get you to buy things.

And I mentioned, Alexa, right? The Dash Wand can't do everything -- no music, no reminders and, perhaps most disappointing, no kitchen timers -- but it still packs an awful lot of Alexa convenience into a device that ostensibly costs nothing. You can ask for weather forecasts and corny jokes, you can ask how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon, and you can even control your smart home gadgets or try out any of the thousands of third-party Alexa skills. That alone might be enough to get a lot of people to try this thing out.

Getting started with the Dash Wand was pretty simple -- just insert the two included AAA batteries and hold the button down until it enters pairing mode. From there, you'll go to a link on your mobile device that'll sync the Dash Wand up with your Amazon account and your home's Wi-Fi network.

As for storage, you can hang the Dash Wand from an included stick-up hook, or just stick it to the fridge thanks to a built-in magnet.

We spent a couple of days playing with the Dash Wand at the CNET Smart Home, and it performed pretty well. The scanner never failed to read a barcode, and if I'd ever scan something a couple of times in quick succession (say, if I wasn't certain it had worked), it'd still only add one unit to my cart. Alexa voice ordering worked well too, though you'll need to specify what brand you want in the Amazon app if you ask for something generic, like ""toilet paper.""

I had less luck when I tried asking Alexa to add multiple things to our cart. Amazon's listing for the Dash Wand claims you should be able to do this, giving the example command, ""Strawberries. Bananas,"" but that didn't work when I tried it out.

Instead, the Wand added a single item to my shopping list that asked me to specify which kind of ""strawberries bananas"" I wanted. Here's hoping Amazon tweaks that in the near future, as ideally, you should be able to read off your whole shopping list to Alexa if you so choose.

I'd also like to see Amazon let you pair this thing with another Alexa product, like the Echo or Echo Dot smart speakers. That could be a potential workaround for the fact that the Dash Wand can't stream music or set kitchen timers on its own.

One last note: with its simple design and ease of use, the Amazon Dash Wand is definitely kid-friendly -- but perhaps too much so. I can just imagine my Star Wars-obsessed nephews using it as a makeshift lightsaber or laser blaster (and perhaps scanning every barcode in my brother's place in the process).

Alexa is a powerful, popular voice assistant, and it's hard to fault a device that'll get her into your kitchen as cheaply as the Dash Wand will. Easier online grocery orders aren't enough of a selling point on their own to make it a must-have, but Amazon is clearly working hard at changing that. Extending its AmazonFresh Pickup service to Whole Foods locations across the US would obviously be a good step in that direction.

Still, if the Dash Wand is trying to get us hooked on online grocery shopping, then Alexa's the bait. Even if you couldn't care less about Amazon's grocery games, the $20 Dash Wand still makes sense as an extra Alexa access point, or perhaps as a cheap way for newbies to take her for a test drive. If that gets more people on board with Amazon's grocery strategy, the Dash Wand will be seen as a success."
Ring Video Doorbell Pro review:|"

Smart doorbells are an entirely new breed of buzzer. Part door chime and part security camera, these hybrid devices alert you to activity whether you're home or away. Ring's $249 premium smart buzzer, the Video Doorbell Pro, is the latest model I've gotten my hands on (£195/AU$325, converted).

Good stuff: The Video Doorbell Pro transmits video in crisp 1080p HD resolution and it has a slimmer design than many other connected door bells, including earlier models from Ring itself.

Not-so-good stuff: You have to pay at least $3 per month for cloud video storage.

The Ring Pro is well worth consideration, but its main selling point is its small size. If you aren't installing your new doorbell on a narrow doorframe, I'd go with SkyBell's round HD Wi-Fi Video Doorbell instead. It costs 50 bucks less than the Ring Pro, comes with free cloud storage and works with more major smart home platforms.

Where most connected doorbells today measure roughly 2.5 to 3 inches wide (7.6cm), Ring's Pro clocks in at just 1.85 inches (4.7cm). That may not seem like a big difference, but it will matter a lot when it's time to replace your existing buzzer. Since non-smart doorbells are typically very small, builders often route the necessary electrical wiring to doorframes as a default.

That means you have just an inch or two of horizontal space to work with before the buzzer begins to extend past the frame. Case in point: August's 2.9-inch square Doorbell Cam.

The Ring Pro's 1.85 inches might still be too wide for some spaces, but it's definitely a slimmer design than any other camera-equipped buzzer I've reviewed.

For me that's a significant selling point. I know I wouldn't want to deal with rerouting my doorbell wiring to brick or siding; you probably won't want to, either.

And while the Video Doorbell Pro has to be hardwired, Ring's installation process is very simple. Wire extenders are even included in the box so you can improve your connection, if needed. Always consult a professional if you have any questions about the wiring. Otherwise, this installation should take less than 30 minutes (assuming you don't have to reroute wiring or drill a lot of new holes).

Ring even includes all four interchangeable faceplates with your purchase so you can change the color finish easily whenever you want. The colors include satin nickel, venetian (aged bronze), satin black and pearl white.

So, how does Ring's Pro doorbell compare with other smart buzzers? The news is mostly good, except that it's $50 more expensive. Take a look:

The Pro is also quite similar to Ring's $199 Video Doorbell. It has live video streaming, the same $3 monthly minimum subscription for cloud storage and the same third-party partnerships with IFTTT and Wink. Design and resolution are the main distinguishing features; the smaller Pro has 1080p HD video and the more basic Video Doorbell has 720p HD. The existing Video Doorbell also has a rechargeable battery in case you don't want to deal with wiring -- you can hardwire it if you want to, though.

Ring's Video Doorbell Pro delivered prompt alerts and the live feed worked well in day and night vision mode (this feature kicks in automatically in low-light conditions). I like that you can set motion alert zones on the video feed in the Ring app. You can also schedule when you receive alerts. Of course, you'll need to check the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the install location before you buy. If it's spotty, the live feed and other video-dependent features won't work well (or at all).

But SkyBell's HD buzzer stands out the most here. For $50 less, you get 1080p HD video, free cloud storage and integration with Amazon's voice control platform, Alexa.

Ring's $249 Video Doorbell Pro is definitely smart, but its main selling point is its small design. If you want a connected buzzer that's more likely to fit on a doorframe, this is the model for you. Otherwise, it doesn't offer much more than most of the $199 doorbells sold today. The SkyBell HD is particularly compelling since it costs less than Ring's Pro, but has the same 1080p resolution with the added bonus of free cloud storage and Alexa support."
Cnct IntelliPlug review:|"

Connected plugs might be the building blocks of a smart home, but they can also be really annoying with their blocky design getting in the way of other outlets. Now a new smart plug is on the market, the Cnct IntelliPlug, and it's setting the standard for the smart plug industry.

The Cnct IntelliPlug is a Wi-Fi enabled smart plug (meaning it connects directly to your phone), with an unobtrusive design, easy setup and an extremely low $20 price tag. The Cnct (pronounced ""connect"") works with the Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) line for voice control, and includes a countdown timer, scheduling functions and remote control. While it doesn't boast the rich features of pricier devices, the Cnct IntelliPlug is the best affordable plug you'll find right now.

Here's a breakdown of the features the Cnct IntelliPlug has:

The IntelliPlug doesn't have:

The feature that really stands out on the IntelliPlug is the countdown timer, which a surprising number of smart plugs don't include. The timer allows a little more flexibility than simple scheduling, as you can set a function to run, say, 10 minutes from now, and to stop 30 minutes after that -- all without having to check the time of day at all.

Wi-Fi connection (meaning no hub required)Voice control (Alexa only)Countdown timerScheduling featureRemote controlSmart charging (the plug will automatically turn off once your plugged-in phone is fully charged)

HomeKit or Google Home ($129.00 at Jet.com) integrationEnergy usage trackingIFTTT integration

The rest of the features work reliably (although the smart charging feature is really unnecessary, as most smart phones regulate overcharging themselves now).

The biggest features missing are the integrations -- particularly with HomeKit and IFTTT. These two integrations allow for much better cooperation between devices, which makes smart homes really smart. And right now, device cooperation isn't really possible with the IntelliPlug.

The Cnct IntelliPlug's claim to fame is its size, which to its credit, is much smaller than the competition -- whether you compare it with the more feature-rich $35 Belkin WeMo Mini or the more basic $25 Geeni Energi. Its tiny design doesn't entirely avoid blocking other outlets, as its rounded edges can get in the way of some oddly shaped plugs. But you'll likely blame the oddly shaped plug more than the IntelliPlug when you run into problems.

The real size difference that matters is in price. The $20 dollar price tag (not to mention the limited-time Indiegogo packages) is the lowest we've seen so far in the industry. One use suggested on the IntelliPlug's Indiegogo page is plugging in a curling iron, so if you forgot to switch it off before leaving for work you can do it remotely. With more expensive plugs, that would seem absurd; $35 to be sure you switched off a device you may not use daily? But at $20, mundane uses like these start seeming like decent investments.

The Cnct IntelliPlug is the smallest smart plug around, and it has the smallest price tag for its respectable suite features. Sure, it won't perform the functions of pricier competitors, and it needs more integrations before becoming the best smart plug on the market across all price categories. But for now, this is certainly the best affordable smart plug money can buy.

The Cnct IntelliPlug is available for preorder on Indiegogo now, and the developer plans to ship units as early as July."
Amazon Echo Look review:|"

Read this description of the Amazon Echo Look out loud: A $200 photo and video camera with a smart speaker built-in that also takes selfies and doles out fashion advice.

Does this sound silly? Then this product isn't for you, and nothing I say in these next few hundred words will convince you otherwise.

Amazon designed the Echo Look to appeal to a specific set of folks who care about their outward appearance and want a digital fashion adviser. You use the Echo Look's camera to take hands-free, full-body selfies and videos that you store in the accompanying app. Amazon then uses a combination of artificial intelligence and advice from real stylists to help you decide between two outfits. And as crazy as it sounds, it does this job really well.

The Echo Look is at its best when you treat it as a fashion adviser instead of a smart-home speaker. It gives you an easy way to catalog your wardrobe and get a real-life view of how you look in your clothes. And the Style Check feature provides surprisingly good feedback about what you should wear.

But the Echo Look still has its faults. Its sound quality is poor, especially when you compare it to other Echo speakers. The app could use a few additional features to give you more proactive fashion advice. And it gives me pause to consider the amount of visual information Amazon will gobble up with this thing.

If you consider yourself fashion-conscious, you might want to find a spot in your budget and your closet for the Echo Look. But if you just want a smart speaker without a side of fashion advice, you're better off with one of Amazon's other Alexa-powered products.

At its core, the Echo Look is an internet-connected selfie and quick video camera that shares most of the same features as the rest of Amazon's line of Echo products (the original Echo, the Echo Dot, the Echo Tap and the upcoming Echo Show).

It runs on Alexa, Amazon's voice-activated virtual assistant, and it can do almost everything other Alexa devices can. Via spoken Alexa commands, the Echo Look can stream music, check your calendar or tell you about the weather, among other tasks. And it connects to other internet-connected devices like plugs or light bulbs so you can control your smart-home with your voice.

In terms of looks, the Echo Look is more like a security camera than a speaker. It's only 2.4 by 2.4 by 6.3 inches, so it doesn't take up that much space. It screws into a base that allows you to easily tilt the camera to get the best shot of you (you can also mount it to a wall).

There are some noticeable shortcomings when you compare the Echo Look to its sister speakers. You can't use it to send or receive messages, and it can't differentiate which speaker you're talking to if you have more than one Echo device in your home. The Echo Look's sound quality is also noticeably worse than its sister Echos because the speaker is located on the back of the unit, so it projects sound away from you rather than toward you.

Remember that scene in ""Clueless"" (the 1995 movie, not the watered-down TV show) when Alicia Silverstone's Cher was getting ready for her big lose-her-virginity date with Christian? She had some sage advice: ""I don't rely on mirrors, so I always take Polaroids.""

The Echo Look is the 2017 version of Cher's preferred way to preview an outfit. You place the camera on an elevated surface like the top of a dresser. Pull up the Echo Look app on your phone and use the video feed to adjust the camera so it captures a full-body view.

Once you're satisfied with the view, you can start taking selfies. This is where Alexa comes into play. You use voice commands to activate the camera, which gives you a hands-free way to grab a selfie. Let's say you want to see how you look in a new pair of jeans and a top. Put on the outfit, use the app to see the camera's view and position yourself in the middle of the frame and say, ""Alexa, take my picture."" The Echo Look will beep twice, then the four LED lights that surround the camera will illuminate, and the camera takes your photo on the third beep.

The Echo Look app (available for iOS and Android) keeps up with all your photos organized by date in the ""Looks"" section. By default, your photo appears up in the app with a slightly blurred background so you and your outfit pop (you can disable that setting). Each picture includes a ""Details"" section where you can add notes about your outfit. This section also keeps a record of what the weather was on that day to provide your future self with some context for your past outfit choices.

The Echo Look wouldn't be an Amazon product if there wasn't some encouragement to buy some clothes through the online retailer. In the ""Details"" section of some pictures, you'll find pictures of clothing options that are similar to what you're wearing in the selfie. If you select one of the comparable outfits, the Echo Look app redirects you straight to the Amazon listing for the item. This inevitable tie-in to online shopping is fairly unobstrusive, and it isn't available with every photo. And the outfits that the Echo Look app suggests are pretty spot-on.

You can also use the Echo Look to capture 6-second videos of yourself, ideally to get a 360-degree view of your ensemble and answer the age-old question: ""How does my ass look?"" Say, ""Alexa, take my video,"" wait for the aforementioned beeps, and do a twirl. These videos are stored in the same space on the app as the still shots, with the same option to add details about your outfit. And if you really like what you see, you can download and share your photos and videos from within the app.

The photos and video that the Echo Look captures provide a good view of what you're wearing that indeed trumps what you get from a mirror. They're well lit thanks to the LED lights on the body of the Echo Look, and the voice activation eliminates the need for selfie sticks, self timers or a patient partner who doesn't mind taking your picture.

I'd like to see the Echo Look app beef up what you can do with your pictures in the app. For example, it would be helpful to be able to categorize your clothes with labels like ""dressy,"" ""business professional"" or ""casual"" so you can easily scan through your wardrobe for a specific occasion. But overall, I think ""Clueless'"" Cher would be pleased.

One of the biggest draws of the Echo Look is the app's Style Check feature. Here's how it works: You select two photos of yourself in different outfits and submit them to Style Check. In about a minute, Style Check will return a recommendation about which outfit you should wear by showing the percentage it favors each outfit.

According to Amazon, ""Style Check is powered by combining advanced machine learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists. Our fashion specialists have varied backgrounds in the fashion, retail, editorial and styling industries and are trained to evaluate outfits based on fit, color, styling, season and current trends."" Style Check also asks you to choose which option you like better to help the system ""get smarter.""

Amazon declined to get into a lot of detail about how the Style Check works or how it improves over time. But after a couple of days of heavy use, Style Check seems pretty smart. It knew when I attempted to submit a picture of me and a picture my colleague Megan Wollerton in the same Style Check. For the most part, it also knew when I attempted to submit two different pictures of me in the same outfit. And the camera could even tell the difference between two pictures of our intern, Kaelan Doolan, in the same clothes but different shoes.

After a handful of Style Checks, you can start coming to some conclusions about what outfits work best for you. For example, I noticed patterns in what the app recommended for me: dresses over pants and a top, slacks and a cardigan over a t-shirt and jeans, fitted clothes over looser options. But I'd like to see Style Check provide more outright advice rather than having to review all of the Style Checks to find these patterns. For example, the app could send me a push notification that recommended that I wear more skirts based on Style Check comparisons I'd submitted.

Unlike a spouse or a good friend, the Echo Look isn't trying to build up your self-esteem. Rather, it provides objective advice based on the info with which you present it. And I agreed with the Style Check in nearly every comparison I submitted.

Let's address the elephant in the room: With a built-in camera that takes photos and videos, how safe is it to have the Echo Look in my bedroom?

Here's what Amazon had to say about privacy and security with the Echo Look:

There's also a slight delay between what the camera captures and what shows up on the video in the app. And you can't access the camera's feed in the app if your phone is on a different Wi-Fi network than your Echo Look.

But I see some practical issues. For example, someone in your home can still snap pictures even if your phone's not on the same Wi-Fi network, so you might get flooded with a feed of silly selfies if you have some precocious kids or roommates. And at the end of the day, you're still submitting a lot of visual information to Amazon and trusting that it will be in good hands.

Amazon's Echo speakers have thus far aimed squarely for mainstream appeal. The Echo Look is different. This is a product for folks who care about fashion and outward appearance -- hard stop. It provides a reliable second opinion and great visual catalog of your wardrobe. But if you just want a smart speaker, this is not the Echo you're looking for."
Hive Welcome Home Standard review:|"

Hive's Welcome Home Standard ZigBee automation kit includes a thermostat, two smart plugs, two door sensors, one motion sensor, four LED bulbs and a hub. Set schedules, create custom automations and opt in to alerts in the responsive and smartly designed Hive app. Enlist your voice platform of choice -- Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant -- to control your devices without ever picking up your phone.

It sounds pretty good, right? Not so fast.

Hive, like ADT, Vivint and other professional companies, locks you into a multiyear contract. In Hive's case, it's two years, or 24 months of required $25 monthly payments. (The Welcome Home Standard Plan is currently US-only; Hive is based in the UK, where a Welcome Home plan costs £5.99 per month.) There is no upfront cost for the hardware, but the total cost after two years comes to $600 for the Standard kit I tested -- and even more if you use Hive for longer than two years.

Weirdly, Hive isn't a professional system -- it's strictly do-it-yourself and self-monitored. So, unlike ADT and others, you won't get free installation, professional monitoring or any other advanced features for your money.

Given that I could piece together my own DIY system for less, I'm really not sure why I (or anyone else) would buy Hive's otherwise impressive automation kit.

Spoiler alert: Not really. Here's a quick comparison with some other DIY automation and security systems.

Wink grand total: $457

SmartThings grand total: $490

1x hub: Wink Hub 2.0, $991x thermostat: Ecobee3 Lite, $1692x smart plugs: iHome Smart Plug, $40 x 2 = $80 total2x door sensors: GoControl Essential Home Security Suite, $491x motion sensor: (included in the GoControl Security Suite)4x LEDs: Cree Connected LED bulbs, $15 x 4 = $60

1x hub: SmartThings, $991x thermostat: Ecobee3 Lite, $1692x smart plugs: SmartThings Outlet, $36 x 2 = $72 total2x door sensors: Ecolink Intelligent Door Sensor, $25 x 2 = $501x motion sensor: SmartThings Motion Sensor: $404x LEDs: Cree Connected LED bulbs $15 x 4 = $60

Yes, you'd have to pay $457 or $490 up front for Wink or SmartThings, but Hive charges you $25 per month... forever. However long you use the system, you have to pay that monthly fee. And because you have to agree to a 2-year minimum contract, you're going to pay at least $600 no matter what.

Here's the thing that gets me. Hive's system performed well. The devices were easy to pair with the app and they were similarly easy to control after the initial configuration. I really can't say the same for Wink or SmartThings.

Here are the basic steps to install your Welcome Home Standard system:

That's really it. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you've connected all of your Hive devices. You can control them in the app immediately, including scheduling lights to turn on or adjusting thermostat settings. Two device automations are simple to create in the Actions section of the app, such as, ""When the motion sensor detects activity, turn on the entryway light.""

The system also works with Amazon Alexa speakers and the Google Home. That means you can ask Alexa or ""OK/Hey, Google"" to adjust the thermostat, lights and so on for you -- no phone required. It also integrates with IFTTT for advanced automation with products from other manufacturers like Nest and Ring.

Clearly, I have mixed feelings about Hive's Welcome Home Standard automation kit. Yes, it's easy to use, but that price...? Not so good.

Even if the value was there (if it included professional monitoring, for instance), having a contract term for a do-it-yourself product really defeats the purpose of DIY. If Hive looks good to you and you don't care about the monthly charges, it's a decent option. Still, I'd suggest looking at other options before you settle on Hive."
iHome Bedside Stereo Speaker System for Amazon Echo Dot review:|"

The first product iHome ever released was an iPod clock radio dock back in 2005. It was a huge hit, and iHome's been making bedside docks for popular gadgets ever since. Their latest, the iAVS1, is built to house an Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker, amplify its sound a little bit, and fully transform it into a voice-activated alarm clock.

On paper, it's as much of a no-brainer as that original iPod dock. After all, plenty of people -- myself included -- already keep an Echo Dot on their nightstand and use it to wake up in the morning. Why not commit to the bit and dock that Dot in a clock, complete with better sound quality?

In my case, the price tag gives me pause. This thing costs $70 ($20 more than Echo Dot costs by itself), and it really offers nothing beyond a clockface, a modest bump in sound quality and an extra USB port to charge your devices. The iAVS1 might be a tempting upgrade if you catch it on sale, but at full price, I'm not sure it's worth the splurge.

Let's start with that design. Available in both white and black, the dock itself is fairly large as alarm clocks go, with an upward-facing speaker spanning its top face. iHome pitches it as a stereo speaker system, and it definitely offers fuller sound than what you'll get from an Echo Dot on its own. To my ear, though, it's a fairly modest improvement -- I wonder if the addition of forward-facing speakers on the front of the dock would have helped.

Using the dock is a cinch. Just pop Alexa into place, then connect the short-length audio cable and an included short-length USB cable into the central USB port to keep the Dot powered. The top half-inch or so of your Dot will stick out of the device -- that's because iHome wanted to make sure that people with first-gen Echo Dots could still access the ring around the top of the speaker that controls the volume. The reason that's important? The iAVS1 doesn't have volume controls of its own, and instead relies entirely on the Echo Dot.

In fact, the iAVS1 hardly has any controls of its own. There's a button on top to adjust the brightness of the clock and a set of buttons on the bottom of the dock that you'll use to set the time, but that's it. No volume controls, no radio and no snooze button: All of it gets outsourced to Alexa.

People who use an Echo Dot to wake up in the morning are already used to grumbling at Alexa to shut the alarm off as opposed to slapping a snooze button, but I still think iHome could have done more here. Simple audio controls would have been a nice start -- a button you could pair with one of iHome's smart plugs to turn a lamp on and off from across the room would have been even better. Features like that would have gone a long way to help justify the $70 price tag. Instead, they're missed opportunities.

Something else worth mentioning: The microphones at the top of your Echo Dot might have a harder time hearing you during music playback because of the amplified sound coming from the dock's speaker.

To test this out, I took the iAVS1 into a quiet room, cranked some local Louisville rock up to 75 percent volume, then tried talking to Alexa at three distances: a foot away, a few feet away and several feet away. Up close, the Echo Dot heard me say ""Alexa"" on the first try. But from a few feet away, it took two tries. From across the room, it took three. By comparison, an Echo Dot on its own in the same test heard me on the first attempt from all three distances.

That's a pretty minor annoyance (most Alexa users have come to learn that raising your voice is an occasional necessity), but again, I wonder if front-facing speakers that blast music in your direction instead of straight up at the Dot's array of microphones wouldn't have been a better design choice.

As I mentioned before, I use an Echo Dot to wake me up each morning -- but I also keep a small clock next to it for quick, groggy glances at the time while I'm in bed. A dock that essentially combines the two is a no-brainer product that I'd welcome to my nightstand if someone got it for me as a gift. But to spend $70 of my own money on it, I'd need it to offer more than just a convenient spot for my Dot and a slight uptick in sound quality, especially given that likable, fully-featured competitors like Beddi don't cost all that much more.

With no additional features to speak of -- no programmable smart buttons, no playback controls, no built-in wake-up light -- that's the mark that iHome misses here. The iAVS1 is a decent enough device, but it's too basic to justify the $70 price tag. Wake me up when it's on sale, though.

EDITOR'S NOTE, 4:15 PM EST, 7/7/2017: This review originally stated that iHome's alarm clock dock required you keep the Echo Dot plugged in separately. It actually includes a short-length USB cable that plugs from the Echo Dot into the back of the clock's base to keep it powered, a fact I simply missed during testing. The text of the review has been updated accordingly, and the score has increased slightly, but the overall buying recommendation remains unchanged."
Notion review:|"

Notion tries to squeeze all the smarts you need to watch over your home into a small white puck. For $220, you get three of those pucks and a bridge that plugs into your wall and connects those sensors to the cloud. You can ask a puck to tell you if your front door is open or closed. You can stick one in the laundry room to watch for leaks or on the ceiling where it will listen for your smoke detector.

Instead of buying a bunch of different specialized sensors to do these same tasks, the Notion sensors adapt to your needs by multitasking. I love the idea of decluttering the smart home, but in practice, Notion doesn't offer any practical advantage over more specialized sensors like the $40 SmartThings Multipurpose Sensor or the $50 Roost Leak Detector. The app limits what senses you can turn on together, and some of the combinations you can enable don't make sense.

At the moment, Notion doesn't work with any other smart home systems either, so if it does detect something wrong, Notion can't do anything other than send you a push notification. Because of that, Notion isn't as good at any individual task as the best specialized devices out there. I'd wait for future updates before investing in Notion, or if you know what you want to monitor, you can take your pick from a crowded field of specialized sensors.

I tested the $220 three pack of Notion sensors with a bridge. The $300 package might be the best deal -- you get five sensors with a bridge. Individually, you can buy an additional bridge for $80 and an additional sensor for $50. Head to the company's site to make a purchase. Notion's only available in the US and Canada.

The site also talks about the eight senses of Notion -- temperature, acceleration, natural frequency, light, motion, sound, angular rate and water. In the future, Notion could use all of these senses to their full potential and sense the light levels in your home. It could tell you when your propane tank is almost empty. It could even listen for the doorbell.

Right now, those eight senses boil down to four basic options. You can use Notion to monitor when a door opens and closes (including a garage door), Notion will sense temperature, it'll watch for leaks, and it'll listen for smoke or CO alarms.

Setup's pleasingly simple. You need at least one sensor and the bridge to get started. Plug the bridge into any outlet, and you'll see the light at the top start flashing. Create an account via the app, then you'll scan the QR code on the back of each sensor to add them to your account. Each bridge can accommodate up to 15 sensors.

If you have a big house, you might need more than one bridge so all of your sensors are in range -- the bridge had trouble picking up a sensor when I moved it down one floor and over a couple of rooms. Thankfully, you can position the bridge so it doesn't block the adjacent outlet. Get the bridge and the sensors synced, and you can start placing the latter where you need monitoring via the sticky adhesive on the back.

I used my first sensor to monitor the door of the CNET Smart Home. The app asks you to place the sensor above the knob at the top of the door. I wanted this first sensor to multitask as much as it could, so I used the app to try to enable Notion's other senses.

The app stopped me from using it to listen to smoke alarms -- you can't enable that feature on a sensor monitoring a door. You can turn on temperature readings, as well as leak detection. Given the placement of the sensor at the top of the door, that first sensor would have issues detecting leaks. By the time the water level got that high, I'd hope I'd already have noticed a problem.

Both the $100 Kidde RemoteLync Monitor and the $100 Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight listen for smoke and CO Alarms, and both can listen for alarms anywhere on the floor of a home. A door sensor that also provided this functionality would have been unique and useful. That combination would have made a lot more sense to me than combining leak detection with a door monitor.

I setup my second sensor as a listener, and the app asked me to place the sensor on the ceiling near my detector. Again, I could enable leak detection for some reason, as well as temperature readings.

I suppose the leak detection could catch a drip in your ceiling when it rains, but you'd have to place it in the exact right spot, so you'd already know there was a problem. I used my third sensor as an actual leak detector, and set it up in the laundry room of the smart home, with temperature readings turned on for that sensor as well.

Notion can multitask in theory. In practice, you can combine a temperature sensor with any of the other functions, but can't realistically combine anything else.

At each individual task, Notion performs admirably. I always received a notification within a few seconds of the front door opening. You can also turn notifications off when you're at home, away, or at night. You can manually tell Notion when you leave, or let it use your phone for geofencing.

In the app, you can tap on your door icon to see a simple log of when the door opened and closed. The leak and sound sensors record a similar log. The temperature sensor actually charts its measurements over the course of the past day, week, and month. You can customize notifications with each enabled sense. So with the temperature sensor, you can put it in your wine cellar, pick an ideal temperature threshold, and have Notion let you know if it ever gets hotter or cooler.

The app lets you add and remove functions from each sensor as you please. Even after the initial setup, you're limited in what senses you can use together, but Notion's main advantage over the competition comes if you change your mind about what you want to monitor. You could fairly easily repurpose a door sensor into a flood sensor in the furnace room if you think there might be a problem.

As a flood sensor, Notion picked up water pretty quickly, and the sensor is somewhat water resistant. Notion has two probes on one side of the sensor. When water connects them, it completes a circuit and Notion sends you a push notification. The tech is similar to the other flood sensors we've tested, though some have an option to sound an alarm or interact with your larger smart home to flash the lights.

I also fooled the Notion's flood sensor when I used my finger instead of water to complete the circuit. Plus, Notion's pretty small, so you'll want to be strategic with where you place it if you want it to detect a problem early.

When I sounded the smoke alarm, Notion responded quickly with a push notification if it was in the same room. Notion's hearing ability did prove more spotty when I moved the sensor a room away. It's understandable that Notion can't hear as far as the Kidde or Leeo monitors -- both of those plug directly into a wall. Notion needs to conserve power since it's running on a battery. Still, because of this limitation, it's less useful as a safety device as it can realistically only listen for one alarm.

I also ran into a strange glitch while testing Notion's listening functionality. The coin cell battery in each Notion sensor is supposed to last a year or two. Mine died within a couple of weeks. According to a company representative, it woke up to listen too frequently, but the problem only affects a small percentage of customers.

I haven't been able to replicate the problem on a second sensor yet -- I repurposed the laundry room sensor as a listening device. I did run into another glitch with that sensor, as it looked to have lost all temperature data for a morning, but the charts eventually repopulated after a couple of hours.

The same company representative hinted that the next generation of Notion sensors will be arriving shortly -- hopefully by the end of this calendar year. Glitches aside, Notion functions well enough, but if you're interested in the system, it's worth waiting for the second generation of the product to see if it polishes the edges of the experience and handles multitasking better.

Yes, Notion's $50 sensors are multipurpose, but because of where you need to place them, you'll likely only use them for one task at a time. You can turn on leak sensing in your door monitor, but the app asks you to place it in the top corner of your door. If the water level rises that high, I'm pretty sure you'd know something was wrong already.

Getting started with a $220 three-pack of sensors and a bridge isn't a bad deal, but it's a little expensive. Notion does well enough at each individual task you ask it to do, but it fails to separate itself from the multitude of capable smart home sensors you can find with any of the major platforms such as SmartThings, Wink, and Insteon. If you want connected monitoring, I'd pick what you want to monitor and start with a single purpose sensor. Hopefully, the second generation of Notion sensors will follow through on the promise shown by the first gen, but I wouldn't recommend spending $220 on potential."
HomePod, Apple's $349 Siri-enabled speaker, hits in December|"

For months we heard rumors of a Siri-powered rival to the Amazon Echo and the Google Home. At Apple's 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 5, it finally happened. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, debuted the HomePod on stage during the WWDC keynote address.

Here's everything we can confirm about the HomePod right now:

But iOS developers Steve Troughton-Smith and Guilherme Rambo also spotted something interesting in the code of a recent -- and likely accidental -- HomePod firmware update. Troughton-Smith took to Twitter on July 28 to outline what he deciphered in the code:

Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

We're excited Apple's speaker will be here in December, but it's also been a long time coming. Apple announced its software platform, HomeKit, at WWDC 2014. A few months later, Amazon began selling the Echo -- a $180 plug-in Wi-Fi voice-controlled speaker that answers to the wake word, ""Alexa."" Alexa's open software makes it easy for developers to create their own uses for the Echo and Amazon's other speakers -- the $20 Dash Wand, $50 Echo Dot, the $130 Tap, the $200 Echo Look  and the $230 Echo Show.

Set an Echo on your kitchen counter and ask Alexa to play music and even to control lights, door locks and other home appliances while you prepare dinner. The Google Home, Google's $130 Echo competitor (announced in May 2016) works in much the same way. Say ""OK, Google,"" or ""Hey, Google"" and the Google Assistant will kick into listening mode.

HomeKit, by comparison, has lived exclusively in iOS devices for three years, without a companion piece of hardware to call home. That means anyone without an iPhone or iPad was automatically excluded from HomeKit. A standalone Siri speaker should make HomeKit much more accessible to Android customers, children and other family members who'd rather not use an iPhone to ask Siri a question.

Manufacturers wanting to integrate with Apple's smart-home platform also have to stick an MFi chip in their products before they hit shelves. So instead of a simple software update that would extend to existing customers, companies have to introduce second-generation versions of their products with an MFi chip installed. This happened with the Ecobee3 thermostat, the August Smart Lock, the Lutron Smart Bridge and a wide range of other products.

The question now is whether Apple's Siri speaker will be enough to compete with Amazon and Google at this late stage. Amazon has set itself apart with its sheer number of Alexa products and open software. And while Google has just one piece of hardware, it's quickly catching up to Alexa in terms of features. I particularly like that you can enlist the Google Home to follow along with a recipe or to turn on your favorite Netflix show (if you also have Chromecast).

Apple's Siri speaker will be available in December.

Air conditioner gets smart as Ambi Climate 2 gets a price cut|"

Instead of fussing with the exact temperature, what if you could simply tell your air conditioner if you're feeling too hot or cold?

That's the idea behind Ambi Lab's $129 Ambi Climate 2. This device with Nest-like smarts works with almost every air conditioner. It keeps track of your room's humidity and temperature -- and it adjusts the AC accordingly. International pricing isn't available, but the price converts to about £100 or AU$170.

When I tried out the first version of  Ambi Climate two years ago, I was impressed with how it worked and the way it helps save on electrical bills. It reduces the AC once a room hits its optimal temperature, and then turns it back up if it detects a rise in the room's temperature and humidity.

The magic is in Ambi Lab's data and AI, which figures out a person's preference based on what you tell it through the app. It also considers other information, such as the local weather, to make sure you're feeling comfortable. This feature isn't available on competitor products, such as the Sensibo Sky or Tado.

The new version isn't too different from the first. In fact, some of the newer features announced for the second version, such as Alexa integration and turning off the AC when the last user leaves the house, will also work on the original model.

So, yes, the Ambi Climate 2 is lacking in new features. But that's not the point.

The first model was a tad expensive at $180, especially if you were aiming for a multi-room setup. The second edition is a lot cheaper and better looking. It just has one LED and it's slightly smaller as it loses the older model's unnecessary infrared motion sensor.

I've been testing a preproduction unit for the last two days and it works like a charm, just like the original. It's currently available on Kickstarter with a 20 percent discount. So if you want to save more, now's probably the best time to grab one (or two)."
TrackR Pixel plays lost and found with your stuff|"

Bluetooth trackers can make life easier for the perennially forgetful.

Attach one to a phone, a wallet (or maybe even a cat) and when it goes missing, you can ping the tracker from a phone to help you locate it.

Not to be confused with Google's Pixel phone, the TrackR Pixel was first announced at CES 2017. It has a louder ring and longer range than the larger TrackR Bravo ($19.99 at Amazon.com) and is slightly cheaper, at US$25 (£19/AU$34). It's also one of the smallest options out there.

Being small comes at a cost: Unlike the Tile, the Pixel doesn't have a hole big enough to hang it from a keychain. Instead, you'll need to use the included thread. Adhesive strips are included in case you want to stick it on something like a remote control.

The Pixel also has an LED that lights up so if you're rummaging around in a bag or in a dark room, it should be easier to find. If you lose your phone, just press the button on the Pixel to ring your phone, even if it's on silent.

But what if you lose something outside of Bluetooth range? (Most of these trackers work within a 100-foot/30m radius.)

It's still possible to track down an item with a TrackR Pixel attached. When TrackR users are within range, you'll get a notification through the app with your item's last known whereabouts. Other Bluetooth trackers have similar crowdsourcing features.

The battery is replaceable so you don't have to buy a new device each time it dies, unlike the Tile. It's also useful to have a removable battery just in case the device goes haywire. I've used the Bravo before and the only way I could get it to sync with a new device was by taking out the battery.

TrackR has an Alexa skill that lets you use a voice command to find a phone -- although it's worth noting that you don't actually need to buy a TrackR device to enable and use the Alexa skill."
Elgato Eve Degree review:|"

Two years ago, early HomeKit partner Elgato released the Eve Room ($69.80 at Amazon.com), a sensor that tracked temperature, humidity and air quality. CNET gave the device a middling score -- although it worked reliably, its spare features just weren't worth the $80 price tag. Now Elgato is releasing the Eve Degree, an indoor and outdoor upgrade to the Eve Room, and it's much improved. But the standards for a quality smart home gadget have risen in the past two years.

The Elgato Eve Degree tracks temperature, humidity and barometric air pressure -- but it doesn't do anything. HomeKit is a stronger platform, though, so the device benefits from being able to trigger other gadgets. But the fact remains: a $70 (£60 or AU$130) gadget that only tracks data had better be blindingly polished. The problem is, the Eve Degree isn't polished enough.

While Elgato's newest gizmo performs some functions admirably, that simply won't be enough to win over consumers in 2017.

The first problem with the Elgato Eve Degree is just the basic concept: most people don't want to dish out $70 for a sensor. To be fair, the Eve Degree does fit an impressive number of metrics into its data gathering, including temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. And unlike Elgato's earlier indoor sensor, the Eve Degree will work outside (it's water-resistant), and it tracks changes in those variables with impressive agility.

I tested the Eve Degree in a climate-controlled room, where I adjusted the temperature and humidity at various times and tracked the rate of change on our own sensors versus the Eve Degree. Elgato's gadget tracked temperature quickly and accurately, staying within a degree of the room's actual temperature the whole time. The Degree tracks humidity accurately, but with a little more latency. It took between 10 and 20 minutes for the sensor to register and record changes. These slight inaccuracies and latencies are minor concerns.

The only real problem I found with the Degree's data tracking was when I tested it outside. In direct sunlight, Elgato's sensor lost all accuracy. At 75 degrees Fahrenheit, the sensor read 125 degrees -- a pattern I found with two separate units. Placing the sensor under shade seemed to be an easy enough solution, but that extra step just means extra hassle.

The biggest problem with Elgato's Eve Degree is that the device still won't do anything with all its data, other than to graph it. Unless you're a data nut (which some of us are), $70 seems a little steep for that info. By contrast, you can get both digital and analog 3-in-1 sensors of this sort online for less than $40.

To really merit the higher price, the Eve Degree needs some standout features -- which it simply doesn't have.

The argument Elgato seems to make with the Eve Degree is that, while the device itself might not perform commands, it can trigger other devices on the Apple HomeKit platform. That's true: You can trigger a plug with a humidifier if the room gets too dry, or close the shades if it's getting too hot. But most of those triggers can be set up using a connected thermostat (which tracks and controls home temperature) or a basic sensor like the one that comes with the Ecobee thermostat. Paying an additional $70 for that trigger seems like overkill.

Even if someone did want to trigger HomeKit devices using the Eve Degree, the interface for setting up those scenes is convoluted (a representative for Elgato said this was because of a ""limitation"" on the part of Apple's platform). Essentially, you can't create triggered automations in the iOS Home app using the Eve Degree. Instead, you must create them in the Elgato app, then you can edit them (to a limited degree) in the Home app. Put simply, it's a cumbersome system.

Despite many of my critiques, the Eve Degree offers some cool data-gathering features that could be helpful to users with a particular set of needs. But beyond that niche appeal, the Eve Degree just isn't worth $70 for most people.

Editors' Note, June 8, 2017: An earlier version of this review noted that the screen had been damaged while removing the front sticker. The film over the screen, however, was also meant to be removed, revealing more durable glass. The paragraph has been removed, and the score has been adjusted accordingly."
Belkin WeMo Dimmer review:|"

The WeMo Dimmer is the latest gadget in Belkin's likable lineup of smart plugs and switches. At $80, it's essentially a fancier version of the original Belkin WeMo Light Switch that adds in a few new features — namely, the ability to dim your lights up and down as you see fit.

Like other WeMo gadgets, the WeMo Dimmer uses Wi-Fi to connect directly with your home network, which means you won't need to plug a special hub into your router. For some, that'll make it a more appealing option than Z-Wave switches from names like GE, or even Lutron's very strong Caseta switches. At $80, it's also very likely to be less expensive than the soon-to-be-released iDevices Dimmer Switch (the non-dimmable version of that switch already sells for $100). And, with new support for Apple HomeKit coming soon, it can claim compatibility with just about all of the major smart home platforms, as well as the top three voice controllers: Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant.

All of that positions the WeMo Dimmer pretty nicely here, and after testing it out in the CNET Smart Home, I'm convinced that there are plenty of reasons for WeMo loyalists and smart home newbies alike to give Belkin's new smart switch a shot.

The WeMo Dimmer is the best-looking WeMo gadget to date, with a premium feel unlike the bargain-bin basic design of the switches that came before it. Much of this is thanks to the new touch-sensitive dimming controls. Along with the on/off button at the bottom of the switch, you can glide your finger up and down the groove in the center of the dimmer to adjust the brightness, with tiny LED lights illuminating as you go. It looks modern, and feels fancy.

Belkin did a nice job with those indicator lights, too — they're great for checking the approximate brightness level at a glance, but they aren't bright enough on their own to be annoying. When you turn the switch off, a single light will remain lit to show you where you left the brightness. Turn the switch back on, and the lights will return to that same level. You can also use the dimmer's touch slider to adjust that preset dimming point while the switch is off — another thoughtful touch.

Still, the touch-centric design might take some getting used to. While the groove and the LED indicator lights definitely help, fumbling around for touch-sensitive dimming controls in a dark room will never be as comfortable as flipping a switch. To that end, I wish that the on/off button was a bit more pronounced.

Before you begin using the WeMo Dimmer, you've got to install the thing. Belkin made the setup about as easy as hard-wiring a light switch can get. The Dimmer's four wires — line, load, ground and neutral — are clearly labeled on the back of the switch, and the in-the-box instructions are a lot of help, too.

However, one of the clearly illustrated caveats in those instructions reveals what is arguably the WeMo Dimmer's biggest flaw: It doesn't work in three-way switch setups, where you've got more than one light switch wired to the same light or bank of lights. Multi-switch setups like that are fairly common in today's homes, and while competitors like Lutron, iDevices and GE all offer smart switches that work with them, WeMo doesn't. That's a big, puzzling misstep.

I asked Belkin's team about it, and a representative told me that they're ""actively looking for a way to support three-way switches,"" but added that they have no details to offer at this time.

Since the arrival of the original WeMo Light Switch back in 2013, users have been clamoring for a version that can dim the lights. Belkin could have released exactly that with no other changes and people probably would have been happy. Instead, Belkin has released a dimmer packed with additional features. Here's a quick rundown of what's new:

Coupled with the dimming controls, that's a lot of new utility for WeMo users, and all of it worked really well throughout my tests. I appreciated the quick and easy fade timer function, and the fact that the app even includes a countdown after you start one. It's an especially nice feature if you want a gradual fade to help lull you to sleep (and if you want to schedule recurring fades at specific times, the app will let you do that, too).

Those native long press controls are a nice touch, too. Long presses were originally a feature of the first WeMo Light Switch's IFTTT channel, letting you trigger a recipe on the online automation service with a single tap. It's one of the WeMo Light Switch's top selling points, and I'm happy to see Belkin double down on it by bringing it directly into the WeMo app, though you'll still need to use IFTTT if you want to trigger third-party services or devices.

All in all, the app feels well-designed and fully featured — enough so to hang tough with strong competition from the likes of Lutron. My only app-related complaint is that it still crashes on occasion, and feels a little bit laggy at times. The app timed out on me while I waited for it to finish pairing with the dimmer during the setup process, an issue I've encountered with multiple WeMo devices on multiple Wi-Fi networks. All was well after force-closing the app and restarting it, but it's still less than ideal as far as first impressions go.

One other tiny app quibble: the lights don't change in real-time as you dial the brightness up and down in the app. You'll only see a change when you lift your finger off of the slider bar. That might seem insignificant, but it forces you to use a trial-and-error approach as you try to hit a specific level of brightness. Here's hoping Belkin can fix that with a firmware update sometime soon.

Along with the bevy of new features, Belkin's other key strength is its wide slate of third-party integrations. WeMo gear now works with Amazon's Alexa, the Google Assistant, the Nest Learning Thermostat, and a whole host of other gadgets and platforms thanks to robust support for IFTTT (the WeMo Dimmer's IFTTT channel isn't live just yet, but it might be by the time you're reading this — Belkin tells me it'll be up and running by the end of this week).

Soon, the new kid on the block will be Apple HomeKit, the iOS-based smart home platform that brings Siri controls into play. Users will need to buy Belkin's soon-to-be-released WeMo Bridge in order to sync up with HomeKit, but it's still a welcome addition to the roster.

As for security concerns, here's how Belkin describes its efforts at protecting WeMo users from getting hacked:

Belkin deserves credit on this last point — in the rare instances where someone exposed a vulnerability with the WeMo platform, Belkin's engineers have acted quickly to inform users and push out firmware updates within a matter of days.

At $80, the WeMo Dimmer isn't as outstanding a value as the $35 WeMo Mini, but it's still a very good product that gets most of the little things right. Still, it misses a big thing with its lack of three-way switch support, an omission that may stop a wide number of potential customers from buying in. That said, if you can forgive that shortcoming (or if your home doesn't have any three-way switches that need smartening), then there's a lot to like here, and plenty of reasons to consider trying it out for yourself.

Lightbar — A multi-color LED at the bottom of the dimmer illuminates whenever the light changes to let you know why the light is changing (i.e. white for manual adjustments, green for third-party automations, etc.)Night Mode — You can customize the dimmer's maximum brightness during late evening hours to ensure that the light isn't too blinding if you turn it on during a midnight bathroom run.Fade timers — With a few quick taps in the WeMo app, you can tell the dimmer to gradually fade the lights out for a custom length of up to thirty minutes.Away Mode — Put the dimmer (or any other WeMo device) into Away Mode and it'll randomly turn on and off to make it look like you're home when you really aren't.Native long press controls — You can now program custom actions that you trigger by holding the dimmer's on/off button for more than two seconds directly in the WeMo app. These include turning other WeMo devices on and off and putting the dimmer into Away Mode. Previously, you needed to use IFTTT to program long presses."
Dojo smart home security system seems expensive for peace of mind|"

First announced back in November 2015, the Dojo is finally shipping today. From what its maker -- BullGuard -- has to say, it seems a cool way to easily add a layer of security to your home network.

BullGuard claims that the Dojo will protect all internet-of-things (IoT) smart devices in your home, such as smart alarms, thermostats, baby monitors, smart appliances, lighting, locks and so on. Considering how smart home devices seem easily hacked, the Dojo sounds like a great idea. Let's take a closer look.

The Dojo comes in two pieces: one is a base that connects to your home Wi-Fi network; the other is the Dojo itself, which looks like a large pebble. BullGuard says you can leave the Dojo on the base or place it around the house wherever you want.

Once connected to a network, the Dojo can automatically detect IoT devices and monitor their traffic, something BullGuard calls metadata, to detect and stop suspicious activities. The device has rings of lights that indicate the security status of the network. Green rings mean everything is OK; yellow rings mean that a risk has been detected and automatically taken care of. Red rings, however, indicate that an action must be taken in the Dojo smartphone app.

The Dojo app is available for both Android and iOS and is used for both the setup process and the ongoing management of the device. You can use it at home and when you're out and about. This means, however, that the Dojo is connected to BullGuard at all times, which can be a privacy risk. BullGuard says this cloud-based connection affords the Dojo artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, allowing it to tailor its security policy for each device on the home Wi-Fi network. All this makes it quite cool, though the Cujo that came out earlier this year has similar features.

The Dojo is not all cool, though. For one, it only supports Wi-Fi, meaning it won't work with Z-Wave or ZigBee devices out of the box, though it can indirectly protect them via their centralized hub, such as the Samsung SmartThings.

What's hardest to stomach, however, is the cost. At launch, the Dojo comes with a $199 price tag (for now it's only available in the US, but that roughly converts to £155 or AU$265), which includes a 12-month service fee. After that, you have to keep paying to use it at $99 a year or $10 a month.

For that much, you're better off getting a high-end router or Wi-Fi system ($296.62 at Amazon.com) with built-in security features, like one from Asus (such as the RT-AC68u -- which currently costs less than the Dojo's initial price -- or a later model), the Synology WRT2600AC or the TP-Link Deco M5, just to name a few. These routers offer free lifetime security protection for the entire network, not just IoT devices. And if you like the ability to monitor your home devices using a mobile app, it might be a good idea to wait for the recently announced Asus Blue Cave or the Norton Core.

In all, if you have a lot of IoT devices and have no idea how to secure them, getting the Dojo will give you some extra protection -- assuming the device is as effective as BullGuard claims -- and peace of mind. On the other hand, if you already know how to change the default password of your devices to something strong, which you should do anyway, the Dojo might be an expensive and unnecessary device to have in your home."
LeakSmart Complete Home Water Protection System review:|"

The dream of the smart home doesn't just mean voice control or futuristic touchscreens; It means your home reacts -- to you and to its own needs. This type of responsiveness is what LeakSmart creates with its Complete Home Water Protection System: a leak sensor, water valve and connecting hub, all packaged for $425.

The logic behind the LeakSmart System is simple: when a pipe bursts and your home floods, every second wasted means more damage done and more money lost. A sensor alone could alert you to the disaster, but with its connected valve, LeakSmart can stymie the source of the damage within seconds. It's a sound solution, it works effectively and the benefit certainly outweighs the cost. But the price tag doesn't have to be so high, and that fact alone will likely turn off many potential users.

Paying $425 for any smart home system should give you pause -- it's a lot of money. For that price, LeakSmart gives you a $70 flood sensor, $230 smart valve and $150 ZigBee hub to connect them (you get $25 off for buying the whole package).

For comparison, ZigBee flood sensors generally cost around $40. Hubs vary, but the most affordable ones clock in around $100. Connected valves -- the mechanisms that actually shut off your water main in the case of a flood -- range widely, from $100 to $430. Altogether, if you bought a hub and sensor from Insteon, and a valve from SmartHome Select, you could set up an alternative to LeakSmart's for a bit over $200. That leaves LeakSmart's System in the ""over-priced"" range.

To be fair, many other competitors are equally over-priced (the FortrezZ valve alone costs $430, for instance). And luckily, most users won't pay the full $425 for LeakSmart, because other distributors sell the Complete Home Water Protection System for significantly less.

LeakSmart might be as over-priced as its competition, but it distinguishes itself in a few ways. First off, the design of the flood sensor is pretty solid. It's one of the only devices on the market that's truly waterproof, it measures temperature (alerting users to pipe-bursting conditions) and it detects water in seconds.

If LeakSmart's sensor has one weakness, it's that the water-sensing probes are close together and small. That means, unlike more creatively designed devices (like Fibaro's, D-Link's or Roost's), the LeakSmart sensor doesn't cover much area. So you'll want to be careful where exactly you leave the device, especially on uneven floors.

The connected shut-off valve is just as functional as the sensor. It responds reliably to commands, and when I tested it, the valve shut off consistently within 5 seconds of the sensor detecting water. The hardware itself isn't quite as heavy-duty as the FortrezZ's valve, but it's certainly effective.

LeakSmart's system works with Wink and Lowes' Iris integration platforms, but it stands alone just as well. The LeakSmart hub connects to an app on your phone, sending texts or push alerts when water is detected. The app won't win any awards for user interface, but it works well enough. Given the increasing energy efficiency of Wi-Fi flood sensors (some boasting two-year battery life), though, the question remains: why does LeakSmart need its own hub, let alone one that adds $150 to the price tag?

The negatives are clear: the hub complicates installation, and it acts as a necessary go-between for your phone, sensor and valve, thereby adding a step for potential communication breakdown.

But the hub does add one positive feature: If the Wi-Fi fails, the leak sensor will still tell the valve to shut off. If the power goes out, though, you're out of luck unless you have a backup battery for the hub -- a missed opportunity for LeakSmart's designers to really disaster-proof their system.

LeakSmart's Complete Home Water Protection System detects floods and, more importantly, responds. For anyone who's paid thousands of dollars toward repairs after discovering their basement ankle-deep in water, $425 probably seems like a worthy price for protection. And LeakSmart does perform admirably.

But the product isn't perfect, and it certainly doesn't merit its price tag. If you want to systematically cover spots vulnerable to burst pipes (below sinks, beside water heaters, behind large appliances), you'll need more than one leak sensor. But making LeakSmart feel like the system it claims to be isn't worth $70 per flood sensor.

Should you buy the LeakSmart System? If you live in a house with old or freezing-prone pipes, getting a system like LeakSmart's could save you thousands. And if you can find the LeakSmart Complete Home Water Protection System for, say, $200 -- go for it.

But for most people, $425 just seems like too high a premium, even for the assurance of a flood-stopping system."
Android inventor's Echo competitor will choreograph your home|"

Andy Rubin has turned his attention to the kitchen counter and the smart home. Alongside the Essential Phone, the founder of Android on Tuesday debuted the Essential Home -- a countertop smart speaker that has a lot in common with the Amazon Echo and the Google Home.

Like the Echo and the Home, you'll be able to issue commands with your voice to search the internet for info, play music, and control your smart home. Unlike the two existing smart speakers, the Essential Home has a screen and will offer full touch controls in addition to voice controls. Supposedly, you'll even be able to interact with the Essential Home just by looking at it.

The Home will aim to differentiate itself further by processing as many of your commands locally as possible -- the Echo and Google Home function entirely through the cloud, and gather data from your commands. It'll also offer proactive notifications from the get-go -- a feature still in the works for Amazon and Google's competitors.

Essential's example of a notification hints that it'll integrate with your calendar and have maps and traffic data as well -- it'll let you know you need to leave early for an appointment if traffic is getting backed up.

At the core of all of this functionality will be Essential's new operating system, called Ambient OS. From the pictures, it looks somewhat similar to Apple's Watch OS -- with a simple interface for controlling different devices. Essential is promising much more, saying in a blog post that Ambient OS is ""the API to your home that enables the creation of applications that extend the reach of a single device.""

With an open developer kit at launch, the Ambient OS wants to make controlling your smart home seamless, and will be aware of devices, people and context. Supposedly, you won't even have to do any setup to use the Essential Home to control you connected gadgets. The Ambient OS will automatically ""introduce itself"" to new and existing devices.

The Essential Home theoretically learns about your routines, and can let you know if you left the lights on. Wired reported that at launch, the Home will not only work with big smart home platforms such as Nest, SmartThings and HomeKit, but it will also tie together the major smart home assistants -- Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant.

Essential hasn't announced a price or a specific release date for the Home yet. Undoubtedly, the Essential Home won't launch with quite as many integrations as the Amazon Echo -- Alexa has more than 10,000 third-party skills. Essential's behind the scenes choreography will need to tangibly make the smart home easier to use if it's going to be the better controller for your connected home.

In addition to the Home, Rubin's new venture announced a phone as well. Both devices will have a lot to prove to stand out from tough competition."
Belkin WeMo's new Bridge will, at last, let it work with HomeKit|"

Belkin's WeMo lineup of connected plugs and switches will soon support Apple HomeKit, the smart home platform that lets you control compatible gadgets using Siri voice commands. The catch? You'll need to buy a new WeMo Bridge and plug it into your router.

That's still welcome news for WeMo users, especially since the Bridge will bring retroactive HomeKit support to all existing WeMo gadgets. You won't need to buy any new switches or plugs -- just the new Bridge. Pricing and availability is yet to be announced, but Belkin tells us it will arrive by this fall.

Adding HomeKit support fills the most glaring gap in Belkin's otherwise impressive slate of third-party integrations. WeMo Switches were among the first smart home gadgets to take advantage of the free online automation service IFTTT back in 2013. In the years since, it's added support for the Nest Learning Thermostat, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and many more. With HomeKit added to that list, WeMo can rightly call itself one of the smart home's best-connected brands.

The Bridge won't be Belkin's first new WeMo gadget of the year, or even its second. In January, Belkin debuted the new WeMo Mini smart switch and WeMo Dimmer light switch -- the latter of which we're currently testing out at the CNET Smart Home. Expect to see a review of it in the coming days, as well as an update this fall when the WeMo Bridge arrives."
Olive & Dove RemoCam review:|"

Unlike most DIY security cameras, Olive & Dove's $199 live streaming HD RemoCam offers infrared device control. Essentially, it's a secondary IR remote for your TV, desk fan -- and other basic home electronics. It's a unique feature (if not a little outdated), but it's pretty limited, too. RemoCam has to be facing the device you want it to control and that's it as far as ""smart"" features go; the camera doesn't currently support any smart home platforms.

The RemoCam is all right overall, but its features fall far behind most of the DIY cams we've tested. That ultimately makes it difficult to recommend.

Note: RemoCam is only available in the US right now, but Olive & Dove is working on expanding. At the current exchange rate, the price converts to roughly £155 and AU$265.

"" data-image-credit=""Screenshot by CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""remocam1.jpg"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""RemoCam1"" data-image-filename=""remocam1.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2017/05/24"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""2208"" data-image-width=""1242"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox=""enabled"" data-parallax="""">

RemoCam's 720p HD camera has a narrow 70-degree field of view, but it also has a 335-degree panning angle, a 95-degree tilting angle and a 3x digital zoom. Opting for a PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) camera over a fixed-angle model that doesn't rotate horizontally or vertically is a matter of choice.

A lot of fixed-angle models like Piper's $280 NV cover a wide field of view, typically at least 120 degrees (the NV has an impressive 180-degree field of view). A PTZ model's viewing angle is often smaller, but it makes up for that with its ability to move to capture activity happening outside the field of view. RemoCam's pan and tilt functionality is quiet and easy to adjust in the RemoCam app.

While the camera is relatively easy to setup, the app could look better. Little details like the way the ""Speak"" and ""Listen"" icons cover the words slightly made the app seem like a beta version (see the screenshot to the right).

Still, everything worked pretty well. You can pull up the live feed whenever you want, the camera automatically switches to night-vision mode in low-light conditions and you can sound the built-in siren on-demand (or  program it to sound when there's motion activity). The motion sensor was much too responsive, though, delivering continuous push alerts even with the sensitivity setting set to ""Low"" in the app. The quality of the night vision could be better, too.

Use a microSD card (up to 32GB, not included) to record locally or opt in to contract-free event-based cloud video storage. Olive & Dove gives you 30-day access to cloud storage for free. After that, you'll need to choose from among the following options: $4 per month for 3-day storage; $8 per month for 7-day storage or $28 per month for 30-day storage.

I wouldn't recommend Olive & Dove's $199 RemoCam. The infrared control is sort of interesting, but extremely limited; the camera also doesn't work with any smart home platforms. And, while its live streaming mode worked fine, its motion alerts were much too frequent. What you end up with is a fairly pricey camera that just doesn't stack up to competing models like the $150 Zmodo Pivot, the $60 Tend Secure Lynx or the $199 Canary Flex.

Olive & Dove also sells RemoBell, a $199/£155/AU$265 battery-powered weatherproof doorbell. Check out the full RemoBell review."
Olive & Dove RemoBell review:|"

The only way Olive & Dove's RemoBell differentiates itself from Ring, SkyBell and August doorbells is its power source -- it relies exclusively on AA batteries. If you'd rather swap out AAs than deal with electrical wiring or rechargeable batteries, RemoBell could be for you. In every other respect, this product is behind the curve. It doesn't have live streaming or third-party smart home integrations and it costs $199 -- the same as the competition. For me, RemoBell just isn't worth it.

(Note: RemoBell will be available overseas later this year. Converted, that's roughly £155 and AU$265.)

RemoBell has decent specs, but they don't quite stack up to other $199 models. Take a look at the comparison chart below to see for yourself.

Yep, RemoBell's field of view is narrower, it doesn't have live streaming (to conserve battery power) and you have to pay more for less cloud storage. Ring charges $3 per month for 6 months of storage and SkyBell offers free storage. August is the exception -- it charges more than Olive & Dove for the same 30-day cloud storage.

Olive & Dove told me IFTTT and Amazon Alexa integration is in the works, but RemoBell doesn't currently have any smart-home partnerships.

RemoBell performed fine, delivering push alerts either when the doorbell detected motion or when someone rang the doorbell. It then lets you (temporarily) view a live feed of the person and talk with them via built-in intercom capabilities. Of course, performance will vary based on the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the install location.

Olive & Dove's RemoBell is a fine connected doorbell, but it just doesn't offer enough features to make it worthwhile. Look instead to Ring, SkyBell or August. SkyBell's HD buzzer is particularly appealing, given that it offers free cloud storage and more smart home partnerships than the rest.

Olive & Dove also sells RemoCam, a $199/£155/AU$265 Wi-Fi live streaming HD pan-tilt security camera. Read the full RemoCam review."
Ring Floodlight Cam review:|"

Ring's $249 (£195, AU$330 converted) Floodlight Cam is a definite improvement over your typical outdoor security light. In addition to being equipped with two LEDs, this Wi-Fi device also comes with an integrated 1080p HD security camera. Sign up for motion alerts in the related Ring app, where you can also set activity zones, create schedules and control the built-in 110-decibel siren. Starting at $3 per month, you can view saved video history on a contract-free basis.

There's clearly a lot of functionality packed into this thing, but I can't give it full marks for the following reasons:

While these limitations make Ring's clever floodlight-security camera hybrid slightly less recommendable, it's still well worth your consideration.

Netgear's Arlo was one of the first products to popularize modern, DIY outdoor home security. Since then, plenty of other manufacturers have followed suit with related devices like the Nest Cam Outdoor and the Canary Flex. Weatherproof security cameras integrated into outdoor lighting is one subcategory that has developed slowly, but is now becoming an industry trend.

Take a look at the Ring Floodlight Cam's specs versus its main competition:

Ring's Floodlight Cam costs more than Kuna and Toucan, but less than Netatmo's Welcome. At the same time, the Floodlight Cam has 1080p HD video resolution compared to Kuna and Toucan's 720p HD. The Floodlight Cam's $3 per month cloud storage fee is also less than Kuna and Toucan's. The Welcome camera, on the other hand, has internal local storage so you don't have to worry about a monthly expense at all.

The Ring Floodlight Cam tacks on some additional features like activity zones and night vision (which Kuna and Toucan don't offer). Ring also promises to add Floodlight Cam support for IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings, Wink and even Apple HomeKit soon. (A Ring representative told me Floodlight Cam's are already outfitted with the Apple MFi chips needed for HomeKit, it's just a matter of activating them.)

The Floodlight Cam comes equipped with two 1,500-lumen LEDs, which are each roughly equivalent to a 100W incandescent bulb. That isn't incredibly bright, particularly if you install it high on your roofline like a typical floodlight. Of course, you can also install it lower so it doubles as a porch light.

Ring's Floodlight Cam is a fairly simple DIY installation, but it's a hardwired device. If you have any reservations about setting up a product that requires electrical wiring, hire someone to handle it for you. I enlisted one of CNET's technical gurus, Steve Conaway, to install the Floodlight Cam.

It took Steve about 30 minutes from start to finish, but we ran into an unexpected setback along the way. The width of the Floodlight Cam's baseplate didn't match up with the width of the standard-sized electrical box at the CNET Smart Home. So, we currently have just one screw holding up the whole thing. That workaround has worked surprisingly well for us during testing, but it wouldn't be ideal for a more long-term installation.

Once the Floodlight Cam's installed, download the app and add your local Wi-Fi info to get it online; this should take roughly 5 minutes.

Now you're ready to opt-in to motion alerts, create activity zones and more. One important thing to note is that you have to create activity zones before you receive any motion alerts, even if you've already enabled motion alerts. Once I figured that out, everything worked well. I received prompt alerts tied to motion outside. You can adjust the sensitivity of the sensor, too, if you're getting too many notifications of your neighbor's cat.

The live feed was clear in day and night mode and it was easy to set motion and lighting schedules in the app. The main limitation of this device will likely be your Wi-Fi connection. Out here in the Kentucky countryside, the Wi-Fi is hit-and-miss.

During testing, the area around the Floodlight Cam typically averaged 10 mbps for download speed and 1 mbps (or slightly less) for upload speed. The Ring app says anything above 1 mbps for download and upload is good, but this Ring support page says at least 2 mbps is best. Because of this, we experienced some lag times, pixelated video feeds and a two-way talk intercom that occasionally cut in and out.

Ring's $249 Floodlight Cam goes a long way toward helping you keep an eye on the perimeter of your home. At the same time, I really wish it offered free cloud storage as an entry-level option. I also wish Ring had introduced smart home integrations at launch rather than making us wait. Even so, you should consider adding Ring's LED floodlight and HD camera to your outdoor security setup. It's only going to get smarter with time."
The Logitech Pop smart button joins Apple's platform|"

The smart button market is small, but competitive. Gadgets like the Flic successfully couple affordability and flexibility, and last year's Logitech Pop brought even stronger design to the market. But Logitech has returned with a second-generation button -- one that works with Apple's smart home platform HomeKit.

The $60 Logitech Pop ($199.99 at Amazon.com) Smart Button Kit includes a HomeKit-enabled button and the bridge necessary to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. Each additional button will set you back $40. These prices aren't quite as low as the $35 Flic ($94.50 at Amazon.com) Button, but they're reasonable -- especially given the new integrations.

Logitech's newest device doesn't change the market dramatically, although this second generation does improve on the original's concept. Essentially, using a single, double or long button press, you can control your devices like lights and locks. It's a simple concept that adds convenience to smart home devices too often controlled by cumbersome apps.

What this new device adds is HomeKit compatibility. The Pop will be the first smart button to work with Apple's smart home platform, which means users will gain access to a number of new devices. And most importantly, there will already be an integration structure in place. In other words, all the devices already integrated under Apple's smart home umbrella (and thus controllable with Siri) will be newly toggleable using the smart button.

Logitech is even showing some extra love to owners of the original Pop who aren't buying the new generation. No, you won't get HomeKit compatibility, but through a firmware update, users will be able to control:

The Pop Smart Button Kit will be available in Apple Stores soon.

Hestan Cue review:|"

The appeal of many smart kitchen gadgets is that they're supposed to automatically take care of the hard parts of cooking. Connected kitchen scales from the Perfect Company use weight to determine how much of an ingredient you need to add to your cocktail, smoothie or baked good. A new line of Vitamix blenders will automatically know which settings to use based on the container you use. And the June Intelligent Oven uses a camera to identify your food and cook it accordingly.

The $650 Hestan Cue cooking system has the same appeal, but with a bonus. This countertop ($131.39 at Amazon.com) induction burner, stainless-steel pan and app work together -- thanks to Bluetooth -- to teach you how to be a better cook while it automatically regulates your cooking temperature.

The education component of the Hestan Cue is the star of the product. Videos are included with each step of a recipe, so you can see exactly what you're supposed to do. And there are many delicious dishes from which to choose, whether it's sauces or salmon or pancakes.

It's not as impressive without its app. For example, the Hestan Cue regulates the surface temperature of the pan well, but steaks with uneven thickness gave it problems that resulted in uneven cooking. And like I've seen with other cooking systems, there's no easy way to adapt recipes. You're stuck with the ingredients and steps Hestan gives you. Fortunately, the recipes I tried were very good, but it would be nice to build my own recipes or replace ingredients in existing ones.

The Hestan Cue, which is available online and at Williams Sonoma, would be a great addition to the kitchen of a home cook with ""Top Chef"" aspirations. It will keep you from burning an important dish and teach you a thing or two in the process. But $650 is a lot of money for two pieces of hardware. If you need some help in the kitchen but don't have the cash, buy a decent pan and a food thermometer and watch some old episodes of ""Good Eats.""



The Hestan Cue is like a combination of the Pantelligent smart frying pan and the FirstBuild Paragon Induction Cooktop ($199.00 at Amazon.com). Didn't read those reviews? Let me break it down for you: The pan contains a ""smart capsule"" in its handle that is equipped with Bluetooth, as is the induction cooktop. You download the iOS or Android app and select a recipe. The app connects to the cooktop and walks you step by step through what you need to do. The app tells the burner what temperature is required for each stage of cooking. At the same time, the burner is keeping track of the temperature on the pan's surface, so if it's getting too hot, the burner will automatically lower its temperature or vice versa.

The 11-inch wide pan looks similar to other stainless steel cookware you might see in a store, but with some notable differences. You can't put the pan in the dishwasher or the oven, and the company advises against using it on a cooktop other than the Hestan Cue induction burner. Fortunately, the pan is easy to clean, and the recipes in the app don't require additional steps in the oven.

The Hestan Cue induction burner is 12.5 inches wide and weighs 5 pounds. Similar to the FirstBuild Paragon cooktop, it's hard to store, so you'd have to make a permanent place for the Cue on your countertop. You can control the burner manually through the app by setting a specific temperature or a more general cooking level. You can also adjust the cooking level on the unit itself. If manual cooking isn't your thing, just select a recipe and the Cue will take care of the temperature for you.

The Hestan Cue's app provides a wonderful way to try new recipes and learn how to perform cooking tasks. This is accomplished through videos that the app shows with each step of a recipe. For example, if you select the boneless pork chop with sweet apple and onion sauce recipe, there are videos that show a chef zesting a lemon, chopping garlic, slicing onion and julienning an apple and carrying out every other part of the recipe. This is a handy tool if you're rusty on your technical cooking skills or just want to make sure you can properly dice a potato.

The app's recipes range from basic (bacon, grilled cheese sandwiches) to the more refined (trout amandine, dill and caviar emulsion). The app recipes I tried came out well, but I noticed many of the protein main dishes relied on the addition of a sauce to really heighten the flavor. For example, the boneless pork chop I cooked tasted fine, but it was the accompanying bacon-bourbon glaze that really made the dish sing.

The Hestan Cue also had problems with even cooking, despite its responsive temperature control. Let's take a look at one of the steaks I cooked.

Because the steak was of an uneven thickness, its doneness varied from medium to well done throughout the same cut of meat. You get better results with a method like sous vide, in which food items cook more evenly thanks to a circulating, temperature-controlled water bath that cooks the food through a plastic bag in which it's encased. The steak showed that even a $650 smart skillet and burner has the same problem as a normal pan and cooktop.

If you trust yourself more than the app, you can control the temperature and power level yourself. The burner responds very quickly when you put your desired temperature into the app. However, I wish the app provided basic temperature guides for common dishes if you'd like to cook on your own.

The Hestan Cue cooking system delivers on its promise to teach you how to cook and is at its best when you select recipes from the app. This Bluetooth-connected pan and single burner are responsive to one another to keep dishes at the proper temperature. But don't turn to it for simple recipes -- this is a system for a home cook who cares about garnishes, emulsions and other next-level cooking steps. Unfortunately, the $650 cost is still too high to get the Hestan Cue onto the countertops of many folks who could benefit from this system."
This camera-equipped phone charger keeps a Lookout|"

At first glance, Toronto-based startup Lookout's Lookout Charger is just that -- a typical USB phone charger. But this unassuming device actually has a high-definition security camera hidden inside. Not only is the charger designed to capture footage of intruders discreetly, Lookout also markets its covert camera as a way to spy on mischievous teenagers and cheating spouses.

To the right is a quick overview of the Lookout Charger's specs, straight from its Indiegogo campaign.

The charger's built-in storage, 1080p HD resolution and US and international adapter prongs all give it a surprisingly robust set of hardware specs.

At the same time, the Lookout Charger might be a little too simple. It doesn't come with a related app, there's no live-streaming functionality and it doesn't work with any smart-home platforms. Instead, the camera records when it's plugged in and you can connect it to your laptop or computer via a USB adapter to view the saved footage later on.

I'm not convinced a charger would provide a good vantage point for a camera, since a lot of outlets are located way below eye-level. Regardless, you'll definitely have to get creative about where you install this thing.

The Lookout Charger is just finishing up its Indiegogo campaign with nearly $100,000 raised so far. Its early bird price tiers are sold out, but models are still available starting at $75 (£60 or AU$100 converted). Units are available to ship internationally and are slated to reach backers in July 2017."
Sprinkl helps your lawn weather the summer affordably|"

Depending on where you live, water conservation is a major concern come summer. Everyone wants a beautiful yard and garden, but watering them can cost -- and it's not always as environmentally friendly as we hope.

But a class of gadgets that control irrigation systems has grown over the past few years, helping users water judiciously, per the weather conditions of the day. The latest device to do so is called Sprinkl Conserve, and it stands out from the pack because of its relatively low $100 price tag (around half the cost of many competitors). Right now, despite some sacrifices to its feature set, the Conserve seems like a welcome entry to the market.

The Conserve works pretty simply. You attach it to your irrigation system control panel, then connect to it via a phone app. From there, the Conserve adds a few smart features: remote control, weather tracking and responsiveness, and mobile scheduling.

That means you can control and schedule the sprinklers with your phone while away from home, and set the device to automatically stop watering if it will rain on a given day.

Sprinkl's device has three big competitors: the Rachio, the GreenIQ and the Blossom. All three of these devices cost between $180 and $250, letting Sprinkl establish a new, competitive price point. Of course, all three also include major features that the Conserve doesn't.

For instance, each of them allows users to toggle individual zones of control, whereas Sprinkl only lets users toggle the whole irrigation system on or off. Likewise, competitors work with voice assistants and smart-home integration systems like Alexa and IFTTT, whereas Sprinkl's Conserve doesn't.

It makes sense, given the features, how Sprinkl's new gadget keeps its price so much lower than competitors, and that distinction adds welcome diversity to a small market. All that remains to be seen is how well it actually works."
Cambridge Sound Management Nightingale review:|"

You can find white-noise machines on Amazon for 30 bucks, so why should you spend $300 on Cambridge Sound Management's Nightingale sleep system? Here's a quick rundown:

Good -- Your purchase includes two speaker-equipped smart plugs -- install them on opposite sides of the room for a surround sound effect. Nightingale is highly customizable, even for snorers or for folks with tinnitus. You can set a recurring sound schedule and it works with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT.

Not-so-good -- It's expensive.

Get Nightingale if you're truly interested in advanced levels of sleep machine customization. For everyone else, a more affordable product will probably do the trick.

Nightingale is literally just two smart plugs outfitted with color-changing night-light LEDs and speakers. They connect to the related iPhone app over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (there's currently no Android support). Install them on opposite sides of your room facing each other to create an immersive stereo effect Cambridge Sound Management refers to as ""sound blankets."" Because Nightingale is a smart plug, you still have full access to your outlet for lamps, alarm clocks and other electronic devices.

Open the Nightingale iPhone app and it will immediately begin to walk you through the brief configuration process. Make sure your Nightingale is plugged in, select ""Find Devices,"" add your Wi-Fi details or connect over Bluetooth and create an account with your email address and a password.

After that, you can begin to customize your account. Select among various room types or conditions, such as ""Adult Bedroom,"" ""Youth Bedroom,"" and ""Tinnitus Condition."" Then you can determine if your room is absorptive, neutral or reflective.

An absorptive room is carpeted, with drapes and upholstered furniture, whereas a reflective room has hardwood floors, glass surfaces and minimal upholstery. A neutral room has a mix of both. All of these things help determine what sound Nightingale selects for you. The final step is to create a schedule that will turn your Nightingale on/off automatically.

This entire process should take just a few minutes. While the app is mostly well designed, there's a slight learning curve in terms of locating specific settings and features. They're scattered on various screens through the app.

Nightingale helps you select a white-noise ""sound blanket,"" but you can always change things up if you don't like it for some reason. I learned that I'm not a huge fan of white noise in general. Over the week I tested Nightingale, I switched among all of the options to see if one seemed more calming to no avail. Even so, I can confirm that the two-plug kit is way more immersive than a single-device white-noise machine that only travels from one direction outward. Nightingale successfully canceled out most sounds from the busy-ish road near my house. (You can always adjust the volume to help customize this, too.)

Since the white noise didn't quite do the trick, I switched over to Nightingale's assorted nature sounds -- ""Lakeshore,"" ""Crickets,"" ""Loons,"" ""Whale Songs"" and ""Rainstorm."" Like the white-noise sounds, Nightingale's nature sounds literally sounded like I was in nature. In the case of ""Lakeshore,"" ""Crickets"" and ""Rainstorm"" that was a good thing. ""Loons"" and ""Whale Songs"" were a bit too intense for me.

I also asked my parents to try out Nightingale for one night, since my dad has tinnitus. We went through the same configuration process at their house, except the app selected the custom ""Tinnitus Blanket"" for them to try. My dad said he slept roughly the same as any other night, but that his ears were ringing more when he woke up in the morning. This could have been due to a variety of factors, but it still wasn't a great result.

Nightingale also works with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT. The Alexa Skill is fairly sparse, but I was able to turn on various sounds, as well as turn Nightingale off with voice commands.

The IFTTT integration was a bit more robust. I created an IFTTT rule that closed a window shade whenever the Nightingale nightlight turned on. You could create additional rules for all of the smart shades and lights in your home -- or even adjust your Nest thermostat's temperature based on Nightingale's status.

While we've tested out the It smart mattress by Sleep Number and have comes across a number of other sleep-related devices, we haven't seen anything quite like Nightingale before. Sleep Number's It bed integrated with select health-and-fitness-related brands like Fitbit and MyFitnessPal, as well as Nest, but it doesn't currently support any voice control integrations.

The $300 Nightingale by Cambridge Sound Management is definitely more immersive than a one-directional white-noise machine. For folks seeking that stereo effect, as well as advanced customization, Nightingale could be a good fit. At the same time, snorers or people with tinnitus shouldn't expect this sleep system to be a cure-all. And, Android customers are completely out of luck (for now, at least)."
Singlecue Gen 2 review:|"

Voice control is cool, but the future of toggling complex systems of devices -- like your home theater or smart home setup -- is with gestures. At least, that's what the developers behind the $150 Singlecue would have you believe. If this device sounds familiar, it's because we looked at it a few years back -- but this is generation two, with a greater focus on overall smart home control.

It turns out, controlling your TV, streaming device, and smart home gadgets with gestures actually feels pretty cool (even if you look ridiculous to everyone else). Singlecue tracks your movements well, but its clunky menu system and lack of customizability seriously hurt its appeal. For now, you'll want to wait till generation three or four to invest in the Singlecue.

Here's how the Singlecue works: you set it up by your TV, then using the app, integrate it with devices around your house. I set it up with Alexa, a Vizio TV, an Apple TV streaming device and Philips Hue lights. It also works with a slew of other devices, including Roku, Bose, and Nest devices (you can check out the full list here). After the setup, it tracks your gestures with a camera, and lets you navigate the menus displayed on its screen (which is about 1.5 inches by 2.5 inches).

I was skeptical of the gesture control at first, but it works relatively well, causing only occasional moments of frustration. And when it works -- which is the vast majority of the time -- controlling your lights and TV with gestures actually feels pretty damn cool.

The other big addition the Gen 2 Singlecue introduces is Alexa integration. That means people can turn on their TVs with voice commands to their Echo device like, ""Alexa, tell Singlecue to turn on the TV.""

The problem is, other gadgets like Logitech's $99 Harmony Hub, already allow this kind of control. Plus, with those devices, you can set up particular command chains, so when you say, ""Alexa, turn on Netflix,"" it will power up your TV, Apple TV and sound bar -- and it will start the Netflix app.

Until Singlecue adds more customizable commands, with gestures and voice control, it won't be quite as easy to use as other gadgets.

Disappointingly, even when your TV is already on, and you're sitting in front of it, the Singlecue isn't the most practical remote.

The first problem is, while the Singlecue does have a couple direct-control motions like putting your finger over your lips to mute the TV, or holding up your hand to pause it, mostly you use gestures to navigate its menu -- which is displayed on the small screen on the device. If you want to turn off your lights, for example, instead of mapping a particular motion to that command, you have to use the preset gestures to cycle through the menus to reach your light, then to select its ""off"" function. After a while, the gestures that are supposed to feel natural begin to feel instead like an extra barrier to controlling your devices efficiently.

Secondly, you have to be seated in the same spot every time you use Singlecue. That means you don't have the same control if you're on the side of the couch, or just lounging. While most people do have a particular spot they sit on the couch, this is a major impediment to casual use of the Singlecue.

Finally, the Singlecue's screen is relatively small -- so people with any visual impairments could have serious problems using it -- and it requires your attention as much as the TV you're often trying to control. Singlecue doesn't need to superimpose some graphic on the TV screen itself to solve this problem. It just needs to make the gestures intuitive enough that users don't need to constantly look at the tiny screen.

I was surprised that the biggest problem with Singlecue wasn't its innovative gesture tracking, but rather a convoluted menu system and lack of customizable commands. In other words, the device nails the tough part, and totally whiffs the easier part. Developers behind the device say more customization is on the way, but for now, you have to work with the present menus and gestures.

If you want a solid universal remote, the second gen Singlecue won't be your best bet. But maybe by generation three or four, it will be."
Geeni Energi review:|"

Connected plugs are one of the best entry points for the smart home market. They offer convenience for a relatively small commitment while adding voice control, remote access, scheduling and energy monitoring to otherwise dumb devices. But a $35 entry point -- the price of the up-till-now best affordable plug -- still feels a little expensive and the cost quickly adds up when you expand your setup.

Enter the Geeni Energi, a smart plug that doesn't break new ground with its hardware or software, but does hit an affordable new price: $25. The Geeni Energi doesn't have the flashy design or features of industry leaders, or the integrations of the best competitors. But it establishes itself as one of the best affordable entry points to smart home tech -- which is exactly what a smart plug should do.

Geeni doesn't make a great first impression. It looks almost exactly like the original Belkin WeMo Switch -- which is over five years old -- just flipped upside-down. Its bulky design blocks the outlet beneath it, and when I was starting my account, one of the setup directions popped up in a different language.

So yes, the Energi comes across as a little janky at first. But it turns out, Geeni's product is pretty reliable. The scheduling and remote control features work well, and the energy monitoring adds a nice bit of smarts that many more affordable plugs forgo. Even the app, once the device is set up, is simple and easy to use.

Despite its low price, the Energi boasts an integration with Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) and Geeni says Google Home ($129.00 at Jet.com) voice control is on the way.  While I'm disappointed by the lack of an IFTTT channel, which really expands the use-cases for other smart plugs, Geeni says that's next on their roadmap.

The Geeni Energi's features won't blow away competitors, but this smart plug is nipping at the heels of devices like the Belkin WeMo Mini at a significantly lower price. Compare it to pricier gadgets like the iDevices Switch ($26.50 at Amazon.com) and Belkin WeMo Insight Switch ($34.97 at Amazon.com) (both selling for around $50 now), and those devices start to look pretty unappealing, despite their sleeker designs.

The Energi is a solid deal right now. As soon as Geeni adds Google Home and IFTTT integration, it'll be one of the top devices on the market at a lower price than many competitors. Here's hoping the updates come soon, and the next model has a design that looks a little less 2012."
BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera Station review:|"

The $300 BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera has a list of features that will impress even die-hard weather geeks. It offers the usual array of climate sensors found on weather systems popular among amateur meteorologists and science educators. It can detect temperature, wind speed, rain and air pressure, plus it draws its electrical power from the sun. What makes the BloomSky Sky2 truly unique are its HD camera, its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, its companion mobile app and the way it ties in with other smart home gadgets and services.

The Sky2 is expensive even if it's priced competitively against traditional options from weather station specialists Davis and Acurite. Buying a kit like this only really makes sense if it's in your job description or you have a serious weather fetish and money to burn. Ordinary people with merely a casual interest in local atmospheric conditions are better off consulting a mobile app or choosing a less expensive device such as the $179 Netatmo Weather Station. It doesn't have a camera or solar power, but the Netatmo is a snap to deploy, and monitors your home environment too.

With a roundish body, the BloomSky Sky2 reminds me of giant eyeball that's bristling with sensors. About the size of your average grapefruit, this model replaces Bloom's older BloomSky Plus device but is physically identical on the outside. Just like the first Sky, the Sky2's most noticeable feature is a large camera on its face. The camera has a fisheye lense that lets it see a wide 170-degree field of vision. You can pivot the camera, which sits on a curved hinge, to point straight upward or angle it down about 30 degrees.

Next to the Sky2's camera are instruments that sample relative humidity, ambient light, air pressure and temperature. Below the camera is the weather station's moisture detector. A field of copper circles of various sizes, the sensor detects the occurrence of rain but can't measure the amount of rainfall.

For that you'll have to spend an additional $140 for BloomSky's Storm accessory, which features a tipping-cup rain collector. The Storm has hardware to measure both wind speed and wind direction, to,o plus UV light levels, which the Sky and Sky2 units can't track.

The competing $180 Netatmo Weather Station can't detect UV light but it does support these features, though they're not bundled in the base kit. In fact in the case of Netatmo you'll have purchase separate ($80) Wind Gauge and ($100) Rain Gauge add-ons. Netatmo sells the mounting kit separately too for $25. Not so with the Sky2, which comes with its mounting equipment included. To sum up, that's $440 for the Sky2 and the Storm, and $385 for the complete set of Netatmo gear.

Both the BloomSky Sky2 and Storm sit atop custom plastic poles that double as stakes. You can either drive them into the ground or place the units inside steel mounting brackets that you fix to an outdoor surface. In my case mounting the Sky2 wasn't too difficult since BloomSky supplies the mounting bracket and screws. The Sky2's solar panel easily and securely attaches to this bracket as well.

Unfortunately BloomSky doesn't provide the same sort of hardware with the Storm kit -- it costs $40 extra. That forced me to improvise with what I had on hand: a metal flowerbed, a deck guardrail, plastic twist ties and the two flexible ""U-Bolts"" in the Sky2 box.

By comparison the compact, wireless Netatmo Weather Station is a breeze to set up.

Additionally Netatmo's kit includes an indoor module built to log characteristics of the environment within the home. BloomSky initially bundled a similar gadget but has since killed the product.

The BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera Station connects to your home's Wi-Fi, which allows you access to its sensor info via a companion mobile app anywhere you enjoy a live wireless network. The app, available on iOS and Android, is limited to current weather conditions but it does project a basic five-day forecast. For a full data history, BloomSky hosts a dashboard website that automatically backs up all information the weather station collects. There you can download raw data in spreadsheet form, too.

Of course the Sky2's most striking feature is its HD camera (1,920x1,072 pixels). While not a true video capture device, the imaging system snaps a color photo every 5 minutes and then stitches them together into time-lapse videos. These videos span daylight hours and their length depends on whether the Sky2's optical sensor detects sunlight. One big disappointment though is the actual transmitted video resolution is SD quality (640x640 pixels). Hopefully in the future you'll be able to record at the camera's full HD resolution.

I do like that BloomSky has created its own IFTTT channel, which enables the Sky2 to interact with popular smart home products and services. IFTTT is a free web-based automation service that often punches through the walled gardens many companies build to protect their interests and prevent cooperation among gadgets viewed as or sold by the competition.

For instance ,I created an IFTTT applet that turned on my lights, one Lifx Color 1000 smart bulb in my case, when the Sky2 first detected rain. When blue skies return another applet turns the bulb off, triggered when the BloomSky Storm's UV sensor notices ultraviolet rays move from level ""1"" to level ""2"" (scale of 0 to 11).

Unfortunately at the moment there's no way BloomSky's offering can send push alerts if the wind gusts beyond a certain speed. Neither will it provide a heads-up when current rainfall is about to hit flash flood proportions. Anyone who has experienced unexpected water in the basement would appreciate that. The Sky2 and Storm can't detect lightning strikes either, a feature that many old-style personal weather stations offer.

Another drawback is that the Sky2 is only designed to operate on 2.4GHz Wi-Fi wireless networks. If your home system uses a hybrid setup such as the Google Wifi, which constantly swaps between 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, you're out of luck. This latest Sky2 model though has a Bluetooth radio, which BloomSky says makes the initial setup through the mobile app smoother.

Like Netatmo's weather gadget, the Sky2 links to a network of Sky and Sky2 systems already deployed at large. The bonus here is that these stations offer the added value of captured video and still images in real time. It's also interesting that while BloomSky only officially sells its devices in the US, judging from the map within the app, these weather cameras appear to have spread globally.

The answer really depends on how much of a weather junkie you happen to be or if your occupation benefits from keeping a constant eye on local conditions. I'll wager most people don't meet these criteria and would be satisfied by a simple mobile weather app such as those from Weather Underground, AccuWeather and others. They've become quite advanced over the years and now even provide hyperlocal forecasts based on crowdsourced info, data pulled from deployed personal weather stations or both.

Those who would love to monitor rainfall and temperatures within their backyard or garden but prefer not to deal with lots of complex parts and hardware to set up, the $180 Netatmo Weather Station is the right choice. When you factor in all its extra modules you will pay more for the Netatmo system's convenience. Of course for techie folks who really get a kick out of weather events, it's hard to top the BloomSky Sky2 Weather Station's unique combination of traditional measurement instruments, smart home integration and bird's-eye view."
iDevices Wall Outlet review:|"

For $100, you can swap out one of your home's outlets with the Wi-Fi-enabled iDevices Wall Outlet. Make that upgrade, and you'll be able to turn each of its two outlets on and off independently, or program them to turn on and off automatically using the iDevices app on your Android or iOS device. You can also sync the Wall Outlet up with Apple HomeKit or with Amazon's Alexa to turn each outlet on and off using voice commands.

In other words, each outlet functions the same as one of iDevices' plug-in smart switches, right down to the fact that they'll track the energy usage of whatever you've got plugged in. The only difference, obviously, it that this is a hard-wired product -- it isn't anywhere near as flexible as the switch, which you can plug in anywhere.

On the other hand, smartening up your outlets makes for a connected living space that's a lot more seamless than one that's littered with blocky plugs all over the place. And, to the Wall Outlet's credit, it performed flawlessly in my tests at the CNET Smart Home. With just three wires to connect (line, neutral and ground), installing it was a relative cinch, and the integrations with Siri and Alexa both worked as advertised (there's even a little fold-down flap on the front of the outlet with the Apple HomeKit pairing code printed on it -- a nice, thoughtful touch). Add in the energy-tracking feature, and there's really not much else that I wish this thing was capable of.

In fact, I'll take it further: this is the best smart outlet you can buy right now. It works well, it's got a good slate of third-party integrations, it's easy to install, it doesn't need a hub and it's from an established name with a clear vision for the connected home.

Still, this thing is something of a niche product, and an expensive one at that. I can see the appeal for anyone who's ready to go all-in with smart home tech, but if you're a curious connected home beginner, then you're much better off just getting a plug-in smart switch to experiment with. The Belkin WeMo Mini, the iHome Smart Plug, and iDevices' own smart switch all cost less than half as much as the Wall Outlet -- I say start there and wait for prices to come down before worrying about your outlets."
Roost Smart Water Leak and Freeze Detector review:|"

The leak-detector market, ironically enough, is flooded with devices.

Most of the gadgets have the same basic design -- two probes that set off an alarm when they're connected by water. So, it's tough for a new entry to rise above the rest, which makes it all the more surprising that one just did.

The Roost Smart Water Leak and Freeze Detector costs $50 (that's about £40 or AU$65), placing it firmly in the middle of the leak detector price range. But the Roost's design surprised me by working better than most of the devices at the high end of the market.

The Roost detector is feature rich, as far as flood sensors go. It has two probes, running parallel in a loop around the base of the device, to sense water. It also tracks humidity and temperature, graphing them so you can see trends over a 24-hour or seven-day period.

The coils on the bottom of the Roost extend its range, and they don't rest on the ground, like the otherwise-impressive Fibaro Flood Sensor. Since the coils are slightly suspended, the detector won't set off a false alarm when placed in a drip pan, or on a similarly conductive surface.

The Roost's biggest feature is its Wi-Fi connection. Sensors without a Wi-Fi connection, such as SmartThings and Wink, require a smart hub, which is a barrier to entry for many people. The two best sensors that do connect directly to your phone via Wi-Fi are both solid products, but they're more expensive -- the D-Link costs $60, and the Honeywell clocks in at $80.

Between an easy setup, a solid set of features, and Wi-Fi connection, the Roost seems like the best option on the market right now. But a few drawbacks keep it from total domination. First, it doesn't work with any major smart home platforms, such as Apple HomeKit or Google Home. This isn't the end of the world but it does mean you'll need to download another app, which is kind of annoying to keep on your phone for a passive monitoring device.

The second big drawback is that the Roost isn't waterproof. While the detector isn't a totally leaky bucket, it certainly lets water in through the alarm's top speaker holes. A few drops of water splashed on these holes while I was testing the Roost and the alarm kept going off for nearly an hour -- even after I'd removed it from the water. More worryingly, the Roost sensor won't survive being submerged. So it's a one-shot deal in the case of serious flooding.

Despite its weaknesses, the Roost's strong design and feature-rich interface -- all for a comparably low price -- make it one of the most appealing devices on the market. If you don't already own a smart home hub, then the Roost and the D-Link should be the top two contenders for your flood sensor of choice."
Sense review:|"

Editors' note (September 28, 2017): Since publishing this review, Sense has identified 14 new devices: the HVAC, the oven, ""unnamed heat 1,"" the microwave, ""unnamed device 1,"" ""unnamed motor 3,"" ""unnamed device 2,"" ""unnamed heat 2,"" the ice maker, a light, ""unnamed heat 3,"" ""unnamed device 3,"" ""unnamed device 4"" and a refrigerator. I'll continue to provide updates as it learns more.

The $299 Sense Home Energy Monitor (£240 and AU$390 at the current exchange rate) is supposed to bridge the gap between your utility-issued electric meters and detailed usage data. Sense successfully communicated whole-home watts at-a-glance during our testing. It also detected a few of the large appliances in the CNET Smart Home automatically. But like its competitor, Neurio, Sense had trouble identifying certain devices.

Sense's FAQ page says it's working on algorithms to detect more products, so it might get smarter soon. For now, if you're looking for in-depth data about your home energy consumption, this home energy tracker is pretty limited and I wouldn't readily recommend it.

All of the electricity-dependent products in your home contribute to a total watt (W) or kilowatt-hour (kWh) reading. (Note: one kWh is 1,000W.) At any given time, you should be able to see real-time energy stats on your home's electric meter. This info is then used by your local electric company to calculate the amount you owe.

But there's a problem. Meters, especially traditional non-digital units, are difficult to read -- and they only give you an overview of your consumption, rather than itemized watt or kilowatt-hour readouts of individual devices. That means you're out of luck if you want to better understand why last month's bill was so high.

Ideally, Sense should help you identify individual devices and figure out how to change your usage patterns. That's when you'll start to see savings and reduced strain on the electric grid.

The smallish rectangular Sense attaches to the main switch inside your breaker panel and relies on two sensors to detect unique device ""signatures."" While it took two electricians only 10 minutes to install Sense, this is not a do-it-yourself project. The installation requires the removal of the breaker panel and there are all sorts of potential shock hazards involved.

Sense is compatible with recessed and wall-mounted electric panels. It will work with more than one panel if Sense is installed in the main electrical panel and the additional panels are subpanels. Not sure if it will work in your home? Check out the Sense FAQ for more info before you buy.

Sense CEO Mike Phillips offered some insight on its device detection functionality via email:

According to Sense, products generating more energy are easier to single out, but it is possible for it to identify devices with a low 5W to 10W output.

That's where Sense differentiates itself from Neurio, which wasn't able to detect any appliances under 400W. Sense attributes its ability to detect low-wattage devices to the 4 million readings it takes per second to identify unique patterns. Theoretically, this should give Sense an edge over the competition.

After Sense is installed by a qualified professional, the device should chime to let you know the configuration was successful. Download the related Android or iPhone app and follow the instructions to connect it to your local Wi-Fi network. Sense doesn't currently have a web interface, so you're limited to viewing your energy stats on your mobile device.

You can view a graph or a bubble chart of the wattage output in your home 24/7 (assuming you have a solid Wi-Fi connection). Walk around your house and flip light switches on an off, cook dinner, run the dishwasher and see the visual representations change accordingly in the app.

You'll also get emails when Sense detects new devices, but it doesn't always happen quickly. Sense was installed on February 16. On March 3 and 14, I got emails saying Sense had ""learned new devices.""

So far, it has detected the dryer, two fridges and two ""unnamed motors."" Everything else currently lives in either the ""Always On"" or ""Unnamed"" device label. After more than a month of testing, I would have expected it to pick up on more appliances. Sense told me its ability to detect products can be slower if the Wi-Fi signal isn't strong. Our connection at the CNET Smart Home goes in and out. I just checked its speed and got 6.72 Mbps for download speed and 0.90 Mbps for upload speed. Not terrible, but not great.

Unfortunately, you can't really ""train"" your Sense device yourself. Instead, you have to wait for it to be certain it has identified a microwave or an air conditioner before it moves it from the ""unknown"" bubble to a specific label. Since you can't edit this information yourself, you're left waiting for Sense to catch up.  However, you can edit names of devices Sense identified as ""unnamed motors"" if you manage figure out what they are. I haven't had any luck with mine yet.

The IFTTT rule I created with Sense worked well, though. Sense is supposed to be able to ID things like garage door openers, so you could create the following IFTTT applet: ""If Sense notices the garage door is opening, then turn on my LED bulbs/adjust my thermostat/open my window shades."" Since I only had fridges and a dryer to work with my rule made a little less sense: ""If Sense notices the dryer turning off, then open the Lutron window shades."" Still, the applet worked fine.

Although Sense is supposed to be able to detect devices with lower wattage outputs than Neurio, these two products are fairly similar. Both have decent apps that display real-time energy stats for the whole home. Neurio has a more hands-on approach, allowing you to turn devices on and off and label them accordingly. Sense takes this on for you, but seems to do it fairly slowly (again, this can vary based on the quality of your Wi-Fi connection).

It might also matter that no one actually lives in the CNET Smart Home. We test products here every day, but  we aren't using the large appliances and smaller electronic devices the way someone living here would use them. Even so, I think five weeks should be enough time for Sense to identify the microwave, the HVAC unit and other electrical devices we use here day to day.

Sense costs $50 more than Neurio, but it hasn't managed to differentiate itself in any significant way over five weeks of testing. Usage stats are fairly limited and you don't have much control over how quickly it detects your appliances. It's a useful tool for real-time energy stats -- the house is currently using 576W of power, for instance.

I'm just not sold on spending $299 (plus the cost of an electrician) for a device that has only successfully identified two fridges and a dryer in over a month. I'd hold off to see how we like the competitor Curb and the Indiegogo-funded energy monitor Ecoisme."
Leviton Decora Smart Wi-Fi Plug-In Dimmer review:|"

Let's say, for the sake of argument, that you own a lamp. You like this lamp, but it's either on or off, with nothing in between. You can't dim it, and you wish that you could. Better yet, you wish that you could dim it with a simple Alexa voice command on your  	Amazon Echo smart speaker  -- let's go ahead and say that you own one of those, too.

You've got a couple of options. One would be to pick up  	 	an Alexa-compatible smart bulb from a brand such as TP-Link, Lifx or Philips Hue. Another would be to smarten up the lamp itself.

This is where the Wi-Fi-enabled Leviton Decora plug-in dimmer comes in. Plug it in and plug that lamp of yours in behind it. You'll then be able to turn it on and off or dim it up and down remotely using the My Leviton app on your Android or iOS device, or by using Alexa voice commands. The asking price? $48 per plug.

That's a little steep for my tastes, especially considering you can pick up a  Belkin WeMo Mini smart switch for $35 or less. That switch won't let you dim the lights, but it boasts better third-party connections than the Decora lineup, and it also features a much, much less awkward design that doesn't block adjacent outlets or force you to plug your lamp in at an uncomfortable angle on the bottom of the device.

Still, the Decora plug has some good stuff going for it. Despite the fact that my phone   timed out during my first attempt at pairing with the plug, I came away impressed with the My Leviton app. It's simple to use, yet fully featured, with good controls for organizing multiple plugs by room and programming  automated lighting changes. You can also customize things like the lamp's dimmable range or the fade duration whenever you turn it on or off.

Many will also appreciate that the new Wi-Fi Decora devices speak the same language as your home network. That means you don't need to plug a hub into your router to act as translator.

Syncing up with Alexa is easy. Just enable the Leviton skill in the Alexa app and tell your Echo, Echo Dot or Tap to scan for new devices. From there,  you'll be able to tell Alexa to turn the lamp on or off or dim it up and down by using whatever name you gave it in the My Leviton app. Everything worked perfectly when I tested it out in   the CNET Smart Home.

There wasn't much else for me to test out, though. There's no IFTTT channel for these plugs, and no compatibility with Nest or any other notable third-party products or services. Leviton  plans to sync Decora up with Apple HomeKit this May to bring Siri controls into play -- but in a dumbfounding move, that HomeKit compatibility will be part of an entirely new yet otherwise identical line of Wi-Fi Decora devices.

In other words, buy it now and you'll miss out on HomeKit later. Names such as Ecobee and August have already learned the hard way that customers don't appreciate it when you separate features out like that -- now, Leviton is stepping on the same rake.

""There's a consumer misunderstanding that HomeKit is a feature to be added,"" explained Greg Rhoades, Director, Marketing, Energy Management, Controls and Automation at Leviton. ""In fact, it is an ecosystem and Leviton will provide a purely dedicated solution for these customers.""

""If a consumer absolutely wants the simplicity and benefits of Apple HomeKit and wants to connect the growing number of devices,"" he went on, ""then yes -- they should wait for those SKUs in April.""

In almost all cases, sticking with dimmable smart bulbs is a more cost-effective way of smartening up the lamps around your home. A fully dimmable, Alexa-compatible two-bulb   Philips Hue White starter kit costs $70 with additional bulbs costing just $15 each. I'd need a very good reason to go with Leviton over an option like that.

Editors' note, 24 March 2017: Updated to add comment from Leviton about Apple HomeKit compatibility."

Philips Hue has long vied for domination of the smart LED lighting market, and it's leading the charge into color-changing candelabra bulbs ($154.99 at Amazon.com), too. Up until now, the best smart LED bulbs that would fit into most chandeliers or ceiling fans came from Feit, a smaller-name company with only middling candelabra bulbs.

Although we haven't tested the new Philips bulbs yet, the company's record should give people hope. Its new White and Color Ambiance Candle bulbs will be available in Europe starting in April, and in North America later this year. (We don't yet know if it'll come to Australia.) The downside is that the Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Candle bulb will cost $50 (or about £40 or AU$65), which is significantly more than many competing bulbs (which often cost closer to $10).

The big advantage the Hue Candle bulbs have is the existing Hue ecosystem -- a system compatible with HomeKit, Google Home and Amazon Echo. You'll be able to control the Candle bulbs along with other Hue bulbs using voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa.

At this time, the Hue Candle bulbs won't be included in lighting kits, like this Philips Hue Starter Kit. That means people already invested in the Hue ecosystem will likely be the earliest adopters.

Here are the specs for the White and Color Candle bulbs:

Viio Vezzo review:|"

Bathroom mirrors seem like the perfect place to add smarts: think touchscreens, voice assistants, maybe even personalized beauty tips. Sure, we're not quite there yet, but the $400 Viio Vezzo Bluetooth Mirror does take that first step toward connectivity (although the Vezzo doesn't ship to the UK or Australia yet, its pricing converts to about £330 and AU$530).

In light of the promise of such technology, though, the Vezzo falls disappointingly short. It offers a few useful features, but they fail to cohere in any compelling way. And worst of all, the mirror -- an inherently visual object -- boasts no visual components, instead relying on Bluetooth speakers to stand out on the market.

For now, unless you crave the Vezzo's exact cocktail of features, you'll want to keep your money and wait for a truly smart mirror to revolutionize your bathroom.

The Vezzo is a 24-inch by 32-inch mirror that includes a border light for makeup work, an anti-fog button for when things get steamy and a Bluetooth button for connecting your phone. Between these three primary features, it's a surprisingly simple device.

That simplicity contributes to a sleek design. The Vezzo looks modern, but blends surprisingly well with a variety of decors. The mirror is powered directly, using a plug for the outlet you typically find beside vanities. Of course, anyone who uses a blow dryer, straightener, trimmer or any number of other grooming gadgets knows those outlets are a hot commodity. Luckily, you can unplug the mirror for 6 hours at a time, as it has a backup battery.

The Vezzo's biggest strength is its ease of use. After a relatively quick install -- you have to anchor the mirror to the wall using a thin metal plate -- just tap one of the three touch-sensitive buttons on the front to activate the features.

That's right: the Vezzo doesn't even have an app. When I realized this, I was simultaneously intrigued by the decidedly simple interface and disappointed by the Vezzo's meager features.

The Vezzo costs $400. A speaker comparable to the Vezzo's costs well under $100. Mirrors with similar LED lighting and anti-fog features cost around $290. So it's not a bad deal for the whole package. The problem is, none of the features stand out and they don't work especially well in tandem.

Here's what I mean:

Moreover, a hanging mirror like the Vezzo works best for a half bathroom -- where steam isn't much of an issue, you probably won't be applying makeup often and you won't be spending tons of time listening to audiobooks. In other words, the Vezzo's design and features seem to be working at cross-purposes. In the end, the Vezzo feels like a more polished MacGyver gadget -- a half-bath mirror with some full-bath features tacked on. And even if it does work in some full bathrooms, none of its features make it feel new or essential.

While reviewing the Vezzo, I had to actively resist my expectations for what a ""smart"" mirror should be. Why knock a product that isn't trying to be what you expected it to be? But the promise of a connected mirror is inescapable: you don't spend mornings listening to mirrors -- you spend mornings looking at them. Without something like a touchscreen, or even just visualized weather or traffic updates, the whole device feels a little underwhelming.

The Vezzo isn't for everyone, but it's also not a terrible product. If you need LED lighting and anti-fog features on a hanging mirror, it isn't a bad deal. Throw in a middling Bluetooth speaker, and it might be a device worth considering.

But if you're looking for something special -- or even just a device with solid speakers, don't buy Viio's Bluetooth Mirror. Wait for something better.

The light helps brighten your face from all angles for detail work, but it doesn't offer color temperature variation like the SimpleHuman Mirror to help users replicate the natural light of their daily surroundings.The anti-fog button works by heating the glass to above the room's dew point, but you have to hit it 10 to 20 minutes before the room steams up for it to work effectively.The Bluetooth button lets you listen to music, the news, audiobooks and whatever else you can access on your phone -- but the quality of the speakers is far lower than a good $100 Bluetooth speaker.The mirror even includes a microphone, so you can take phone calls on it -- cool, right? But it doesn't connect with Wi-Fi to integrate a voice assistant, which would add a ton of appeal to an otherwise rather un-smart mirror. Even without Alexa or Google Assistant, something as simple as Spotify streaming would've been a welcome addition."
Fremo Evo Battery Base for Amazon Echo Dot review:|"

The Amazon Echo Dot is a pint-size, puck-shaped version of the original, full-size Amazon Echo smart speaker. It's a low-cost access point for the Alexa voice assistant that can connect with external speakers via Bluetooth or via line-in jack, but it doesn't have a built-in battery. That means that you'll need to keep it plugged in -- and that you can't take it with you for room-to-room listening on the go.

The Fremo Evo wants to help you change that. At $35, or £45 in the UK, it's a battery base for the second-gen Echo Dot that lets Alexa go unplugged for up to a stated six hours of battery-powered playback. Combine that with the $50/£50 you'll spend on an Echo Dot, and you're looking at a portable, voice-activated Alexa speaker for about 35 percent less than what you'd spend on Amazon's own battery-powered Alexa speaker, the Echo Tap.

That's a good deal (especially in the UK, where the Tap isn't even available), but keep in mind that the Dot has by far the weakest sound quality of Amazon's Alexa speakers -- barely much better than the speakers in your phone. And, though you can't activate it with your voice,  	Fabriq's third-party Alexa speaker offers the same portable approach complete with better sound and a better design -- all for just $50 flat.

Still, the Evo worked exceptionally well in my tests, with battery life that far exceeds the stated six hours of promised playback. It isn't quite as convenient as the Tap, but people who already own an Echo Dot and just want to take Alexa out on the porch with them every now and then should love this thing.

The Evo keeps it simple -- just set the Echo Dot on top of it and connect the two using a dual-pronged adapter. You'll power it using your existing Echo Dot cable, then unplug whenever you want to take your speaker somewhere else.

The Evo comes in both white and black to match the color of your device, but it still compromises the Dot's clean, uniform design somewhat. Rigid teeth around the top of the battery form a sort of crown that the Dot sits in -- they're designed to prevent the battery from blocking off the speakers around the Dot's bottom rim. They work as promised, ensuring that the sound still gets out, but they also look a little janky compared with a plain Dot.

The front of the battery features four white LEDs that serve as battery indicators. The battery is fully charged when all four are lit -- from there, they'll drop out one by one as the juice runs out. Again, Fremo claims that'll take at least six hours of continuous playback.

My tests bear that claim out -- and then some, to put it mildly. After giving the base a full charge, I attached an Echo Dot, then unplugged it and left it playing at full volume. Six hours later, it was still going strong, with three of those four battery indicators still lit up.

I ended up taking the speaker home with me to continue my tests. It kept on streaming my Spotify tunes for another several hours, finally running dry at three in the morning after roughly 13 hours of continuous use (save for about 30 minutes on standby as I drove home from the office with it). Afterward, it recharged in about four and a half hours.

Both of those are terrific results, and as I tested the Evo out, taking my Echo Dot around the house to listen to podcasts while in the shower or some music while I cooked dinner, I could absolutely see the product's appeal.

That said, it's not as elegant an option as the Amazon Tap ($129.99 at Amazon.com), which sits in a base to recharge. When you want to take it with you, you just pick it up and go, and when you're done, you just set it back in the base. You don't need to worry about the cable at all.

To that end, a higher-end version of the Evo or something similar with a separate charging base might be a product worth waiting for. You might also consider spending a little extra on a  battery base that doubles as an enhanced speaker, given the Dot's relatively limited sound output. The Evo doesn't do anything to improve the Dot's volume or sound quality.

Still, I like the Evo, and with its impressive battery life and relatively low price, I think it merits a look from Echo Dot owners who are happy with their speaker's native sound output but who wish they could take it with them around the house."
Zmodo Torch Pro review:|"

Zmodo's $200 Torch Pro -- roughly £165 and AU$265 converted -- is actually three separate products. You get a 720p camera hidden inside a color-changing outdoor LED, a motion-detector-equipped wired doorbell and a plug-in indoor Wi-Fi range extender. All of this stuff worked pretty well with the related Android or iPhone app to keep tabs on my front door.

But there's a big problem. The camera light is gigantic and wouldn't fit in any of the porch lights at my house or at the CNET Smart Home. The system also doesn't currently work with any smart home platforms and the app configuration and overall layout is confusing. The Torch Pro is an interesting concept with fine performance, but is ultimately much too unwieldy to recommend.

The Zmodo Torch Pro security light clocks in at 5.51 inches tall and 2.95 inches wide. Rather than having a traditional tapered shape, this light is roughly the same width from top to bottom -- with the exception of its smaller E26 socket. For this reason, it simply won't fit into most small- or medium-sized outdoor light fixtures.

I even ventured to a home improvement store to try it with various porch lights on display. Even with dozens of options to choose from, it would only fit in the largest models. And, if the bottom of the porch light has a tapered design, you'll probably be completely out of luck regardless of size (this happened with the porch lights at the CNET Smart Home -- see the image to the right).

Installation should have been simple, but I never managed to find a ready-installed light fixture big enough to support this device. Instead, I screwed it into an indoor table lamp for testing.

The color-changing LED claims a brightness rating of 350 lumens, a 5,000K color temperature and 100,000 hours of runtime. Those specs are roughly comparable to the Philips 40W Equivalent Candelabra LED. A 40W  replacement LED isn't very bright in terms of output. For comparison, brighter 60W replacement LEDs typically have at least 800 lumens and 100W replacement LEDs typically have at least 1,600 lumens.

Even so, the light looked bright enough when I dragged the indoor table lamp outside. It helps that it's designed for use in a porch light surrounded by glass rather than in a lamp diffused by a shade. You can dim the light and adjust its color in the Zmodo app. You can also set an on/off schedule so the lights turn on and off and any custom color settings adjust automatically.

You can pull up a live feed from the light's built-in 720p, 132-degree camera. Whenever the light is on, the camera will automatically display in night vision mode and revert to day mode when the light turns off.

While the security light provides visibility, the wired doorbell detects motion.  If you're familiar with standard doorbell wiring, you can definitely install the Zmodo buzzer yourself. It took our technical editor, Steve, only 15 minutes to remove the existing doorbell and replace it with the Zmodo model. It probably would have taken me closer to 30 minutes from start to finish. Of course, if you're iffy on this process, always consult a professional. A battery-powered design for the Zmodo doorbell would obviously be easier, but it wouldn't be practical given the power demands of continuous video streaming.

Whenever the doorbell detects activity, it sends a push alert to your phone. Click on the alert to pull up a live feed from the camera light and use the two-way audio feature in the doorbell to talk.

All of this functionality worked well, for the most part. I received prompt motion alerts, was able to quickly pull up a live video feed on the camera app -- and the scheduling function automatically adjusted the light settings to my exact specifications. The two way talk feature was pretty hit-or-miss, though, with poor audio quality on both ends.

The bigger problem was getting everything configured in the app in the first place. Both the instructions from the box and the app were confusing. Basically, there are three main connection methods and the app doesn't tell you which one you need, so you're left guessing (see the screenshot below).

After about an hour without any luck, I called customer service and they helped me connect everything very quickly. Still, this sort of set up shouldn't be that complex. And even after you connect everything, the cluttered app layout makes it difficult to find what you're looking for.

In terms of connected porch-light-style security systems, the Kuna and the Toucan both do a better job. The Kuna is a porch light with an integrated camera, whereas the Toucan is a camera accessory that attaches to existing porch lights. They work with regular non-smart bulbs, but the related apps offer advanced integrations between the light and the camera. Like the Torch Pro, these products don't work with IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, or any other smart home platforms.

Zmodo markets its $200/£165/AU$265 Torch Pro as a simple system for your DIY smart home. But due to the size of its security light, you'll probably have to buy and install a larger light fixture just to accommodate it. The app setup and overall layout needs work, too, and the Torch Pro doesn't currently work with any smart home platforms. I'd strongly suggest looking at either the  Kuna or the Toucan porch light security cameras instead."
Singlecue Gen 2 review: (kdfte)|"

Voice control is cool, but the future of toggling complex systems of devices -- like your home theater or smart home setup -- is with gestures. At least, that's what the developers behind the $150 Singlecue would have you believe. If this device sounds familiar, it's because we looked at it a few years back -- but this is generation two, with a greater focus on overall smart home control.

It turns out, controlling your TV, streaming device, and smart home gadgets with gestures actually feels pretty cool (even if you look ridiculous to everyone else). Singlecue tracks your movements well, but its clunky menu system and lack of customizability seriously hurt its appeal. For now, you'll want to wait till generation three or four to invest in the Singlecue.

Here's how the Singlecue works: you set it up by your TV, then using the app, integrate it with devices around your house. I set it up with Alexa, a Vizio TV, an Apple TV streaming device and Philips Hue lights. It also works with a slew of other devices, including Roku, Bose, and Nest devices (you can check out the full list here). After the setup, it tracks your gestures with a camera, and lets you navigate the menus displayed on its screen (which is about 1.5 inches by 2.5 inches).

I was skeptical of the gesture control at first, but it works relatively well, causing only occasional moments of frustration. And when it works -- which is the vast majority of the time -- controlling your lights and TV with gestures actually feels pretty damn cool.

The other big addition the Gen 2 Singlecue introduces is Alexa integration. That means people can turn on their TVs with voice commands to their Echo device like, ""Alexa, tell Singlecue to turn on the TV.""

The problem is, other gadgets like Logitech's $99 Harmony Hub, already allow this kind of control. Plus, with those devices, you can set up particular command chains, so when you say, ""Alexa, turn on Netflix,"" it will power up your TV, Apple TV and sound bar -- and it will start the Netflix app.

Until Singlecue adds more customizable commands, with gestures and voice control, it won't be quite as easy to use as other gadgets.

Disappointingly, even when your TV is already on, and you're sitting in front of it, the Singlecue isn't the most practical remote.

The first problem is, while the Singlecue does have a couple direct-control motions like putting your finger over your lips to mute the TV, or holding up your hand to pause it, mostly you use gestures to navigate its menu -- which is displayed on the small screen on the device. If you want to turn off your lights, for example, instead of mapping a particular motion to that command, you have to use the preset gestures to cycle through the menus to reach your light, then to select its ""off"" function. After a while, the gestures that are supposed to feel natural begin to feel instead like an extra barrier to controlling your devices efficiently.

Secondly, you have to be seated in the same spot every time you use Singlecue. That means you don't have the same control if you're on the side of the couch, or just lounging. While most people do have a particular spot they sit on the couch, this is a major impediment to casual use of the Singlecue.

Finally, the Singlecue's screen is relatively small -- so people with any visual impairments could have serious problems using it -- and it requires your attention as much as the TV you're often trying to control. Singlecue doesn't need to superimpose some graphic on the TV screen itself to solve this problem. It just needs to make the gestures intuitive enough that users don't need to constantly look at the tiny screen.

I was surprised that the biggest problem with Singlecue wasn't its innovative gesture tracking, but rather a convoluted menu system and lack of customizable commands. In other words, the device nails the tough part, and totally whiffs the easier part. Developers behind the device say more customization is on the way, but for now, you have to work with the present menus and gestures.

If you want a solid universal remote, the second gen Singlecue won't be your best bet. But maybe by generation three or four, it will be."
Abode Starter Kit review:|"

The $300 Abode Starter Kit is an excellent entry-point into DIY home security. It really has everything -- a Z-Wave and ZigBee hub with a built-in siren, two door/window sensors, a battery-powered security camera and motion detector, and a key fob for remote arming and disarming. (Abode isn't currently sold internationally, but the Starter Kit converts to roughly £240 and AU$390 at the current exchange rate).

Abode also sells a variety of other hardware accessories you can add to the system at any time, as well as a range of optional professional monitoring services. Factor in its support for over two dozen Z-Wave and ZigBee devices, integration with Alexa, IFTTT and Nest, and you have a smart system that's easy to recommend.

Setting up Abode's starter kit begins with the related app. Download the Android or iOS software and follow the instructions to pair all of the accessories. Each piece of wall-, door- or window-mounted hardware comes with an adhesive backing for easy installation. You can remove it from a surface with relative ease, but you won't want to do this often -- I accidentally stripped off some paint when we pulled the battery-powered camera/motion detector from a doorframe.

Here's a quick overview of each accessory included in the starter kit:

Abode also sent us a live-streaming camera to test alongside the starter kit. This camera is available as an optional accessory for an additional $149.

Take a look at Abode's specs versus some of its competition:

A couple of things stand out here. Abode's system is more expensive up front, but unlike Scout and Simplisafe, there aren't any required monthly fees. Abode also offers more smart-home integrations than its fee-free counterpart, iSmartAlarm. Its starter pack also comes with a camera -- a unique feature that none of the other starter packs offer.

You have four main monitoring options with Abode:

Hub -- Connects to your Wi-Fi router via an included Ethernet cable and power adapter. It works with select Z-Wave and ZigBee devices, has a 93-decibel siren and a 12-hour backup battery. See the complete list of compatible Z-Wave and ZigBee devices here.Door/window sensors -- Attach to a door, window, cabinet or anything else to track opening and closing.Security camera and motion detector -- This 90-degree battery-powered camera doesn't offer live streaming, but it will take three images when the system is armed and it detects motion. Key fob - Stick it on your keychain to arm and disarm your system remotely.

One annoying thing is that you have to create rules and other custom automations in Abode's web app. I wish you could also do that from your phone. I do like having web access, though, so you can pull up a larger screen with all of the details clearly displayed.

Abode worked very well throughout testing. Whether I was using an Amazon Alexa device, the key fob or the app, arming and disarming was responsive. I also created an IFTTT rule that turned on the interior entryway lights (via IFTTT-compatible Lutron switches) every time I opened the front door. Again, it worked great.

I also received prompt notifications and emails, alerting me to status changes (switching to Home mode from Away mode, for instance). The system's auto-arm and -disarm function, which is tied to the location of your phone, also worked as expected.

If it wasn't already clear, Abode's $300 starter kit is a great DIY option. It makes particular sense if you have more ground to cover than an all-in-one system like the Piper NV or the LG Smart Security Wireless Camera can handle, but you aren't sold on a massive, contract-based system.

And, if you decide later on that you want to add more devices, you can -- either from Abode's own cache of temperature sensors, flood detectors and cameras or from its list of approved Z-Wave and ZigBee devices. The fact that Abode doesn't force you into a monthly fee and works with Alexa, IFTTT and Nest is pretty great, too. Take a close look at this system if you're considering a flexible DIY security setup for your home.

Geeni Energi review: (urrco)|"

Connected plugs are one of the best entry points for the smart home market. They offer convenience for a relatively small commitment while adding voice control, remote access, scheduling and energy monitoring to otherwise dumb devices. But a $35 entry point -- the price of the up-till-now best affordable plug -- still feels a little expensive and the cost quickly adds up when you expand your setup.

Enter the Geeni Energi, a smart plug that doesn't break new ground with its hardware or software, but does hit an affordable new price: $25. The Geeni Energi doesn't have the flashy design or features of industry leaders, or the integrations of the best competitors. But it establishes itself as one of the best affordable entry points to smart home tech -- which is exactly what a smart plug should do.

Geeni doesn't make a great first impression. It looks almost exactly like the original Belkin WeMo Switch -- which is over five years old -- just flipped upside-down. Its bulky design blocks the outlet beneath it, and when I was starting my account, one of the setup directions popped up in a different language.

So yes, the Energi comes across as a little janky at first. But it turns out, Geeni's product is pretty reliable. The scheduling and remote control features work well, and the energy monitoring adds a nice bit of smarts that many more affordable plugs forgo. Even the app, once the device is set up, is simple and easy to use.

Despite its low price, the Energi boasts an integration with Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) and Geeni says Google Home ($129.00 at Jet.com) voice control is on the way.  While I'm disappointed by the lack of an IFTTT channel, which really expands the use-cases for other smart plugs, Geeni says that's next on their roadmap.

The Geeni Energi's features won't blow away competitors, but this smart plug is nipping at the heels of devices like the Belkin WeMo Mini at a significantly lower price. Compare it to pricier gadgets like the iDevices Switch ($26.50 at Amazon.com) and Belkin WeMo Insight Switch ($34.97 at Amazon.com) (both selling for around $50 now), and those devices start to look pretty unappealing, despite their sleeker designs.

The Energi is a solid deal right now. As soon as Geeni adds Google Home and IFTTT integration, it'll be one of the top devices on the market at a lower price than many competitors. Here's hoping the updates come soon, and the next model has a design that looks a little less 2012."
BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera Station review: (wnsma)|"

The $300 BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera has a list of features that will impress even die-hard weather geeks. It offers the usual array of climate sensors found on weather systems popular among amateur meteorologists and science educators. It can detect temperature, wind speed, rain and air pressure, plus it draws its electrical power from the sun. What makes the BloomSky Sky2 truly unique are its HD camera, its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, its companion mobile app and the way it ties in with other smart home gadgets and services.

The Sky2 is expensive even if it's priced competitively against traditional options from weather station specialists Davis and Acurite. Buying a kit like this only really makes sense if it's in your job description or you have a serious weather fetish and money to burn. Ordinary people with merely a casual interest in local atmospheric conditions are better off consulting a mobile app or choosing a less expensive device such as the $179 Netatmo Weather Station. It doesn't have a camera or solar power, but the Netatmo is a snap to deploy, and monitors your home environment too.

With a roundish body, the BloomSky Sky2 reminds me of giant eyeball that's bristling with sensors. About the size of your average grapefruit, this model replaces Bloom's older BloomSky Plus device but is physically identical on the outside. Just like the first Sky, the Sky2's most noticeable feature is a large camera on its face. The camera has a fisheye lense that lets it see a wide 170-degree field of vision. You can pivot the camera, which sits on a curved hinge, to point straight upward or angle it down about 30 degrees.

Next to the Sky2's camera are instruments that sample relative humidity, ambient light, air pressure and temperature. Below the camera is the weather station's moisture detector. A field of copper circles of various sizes, the sensor detects the occurrence of rain but can't measure the amount of rainfall.

For that you'll have to spend an additional $140 for BloomSky's Storm accessory, which features a tipping-cup rain collector. The Storm has hardware to measure both wind speed and wind direction, to,o plus UV light levels, which the Sky and Sky2 units can't track.

The competing $180 Netatmo Weather Station can't detect UV light but it does support these features, though they're not bundled in the base kit. In fact in the case of Netatmo you'll have purchase separate ($80) Wind Gauge and ($100) Rain Gauge add-ons. Netatmo sells the mounting kit separately too for $25. Not so with the Sky2, which comes with its mounting equipment included. To sum up, that's $440 for the Sky2 and the Storm, and $385 for the complete set of Netatmo gear.

Both the BloomSky Sky2 and Storm sit atop custom plastic poles that double as stakes. You can either drive them into the ground or place the units inside steel mounting brackets that you fix to an outdoor surface. In my case mounting the Sky2 wasn't too difficult since BloomSky supplies the mounting bracket and screws. The Sky2's solar panel easily and securely attaches to this bracket as well.

Unfortunately BloomSky doesn't provide the same sort of hardware with the Storm kit -- it costs $40 extra. That forced me to improvise with what I had on hand: a metal flowerbed, a deck guardrail, plastic twist ties and the two flexible ""U-Bolts"" in the Sky2 box.

By comparison the compact, wireless Netatmo Weather Station is a breeze to set up.

Additionally Netatmo's kit includes an indoor module built to log characteristics of the environment within the home. BloomSky initially bundled a similar gadget but has since killed the product.

The BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera Station connects to your home's Wi-Fi, which allows you access to its sensor info via a companion mobile app anywhere you enjoy a live wireless network. The app, available on iOS and Android, is limited to current weather conditions but it does project a basic five-day forecast. For a full data history, BloomSky hosts a dashboard website that automatically backs up all information the weather station collects. There you can download raw data in spreadsheet form, too.

Of course the Sky2's most striking feature is its HD camera (1,920x1,072 pixels). While not a true video capture device, the imaging system snaps a color photo every 5 minutes and then stitches them together into time-lapse videos. These videos span daylight hours and their length depends on whether the Sky2's optical sensor detects sunlight. One big disappointment though is the actual transmitted video resolution is SD quality (640x640 pixels). Hopefully in the future you'll be able to record at the camera's full HD resolution.

I do like that BloomSky has created its own IFTTT channel, which enables the Sky2 to interact with popular smart home products and services. IFTTT is a free web-based automation service that often punches through the walled gardens many companies build to protect their interests and prevent cooperation among gadgets viewed as or sold by the competition.

For instance ,I created an IFTTT applet that turned on my lights, one Lifx Color 1000 smart bulb in my case, when the Sky2 first detected rain. When blue skies return another applet turns the bulb off, triggered when the BloomSky Storm's UV sensor notices ultraviolet rays move from level ""1"" to level ""2"" (scale of 0 to 11).

Unfortunately at the moment there's no way BloomSky's offering can send push alerts if the wind gusts beyond a certain speed. Neither will it provide a heads-up when current rainfall is about to hit flash flood proportions. Anyone who has experienced unexpected water in the basement would appreciate that. The Sky2 and Storm can't detect lightning strikes either, a feature that many old-style personal weather stations offer.

Another drawback is that the Sky2 is only designed to operate on 2.4GHz Wi-Fi wireless networks. If your home system uses a hybrid setup such as the Google Wifi, which constantly swaps between 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, you're out of luck. This latest Sky2 model though has a Bluetooth radio, which BloomSky says makes the initial setup through the mobile app smoother.

Like Netatmo's weather gadget, the Sky2 links to a network of Sky and Sky2 systems already deployed at large. The bonus here is that these stations offer the added value of captured video and still images in real time. It's also interesting that while BloomSky only officially sells its devices in the US, judging from the map within the app, these weather cameras appear to have spread globally.

The answer really depends on how much of a weather junkie you happen to be or if your occupation benefits from keeping a constant eye on local conditions. I'll wager most people don't meet these criteria and would be satisfied by a simple mobile weather app such as those from Weather Underground, AccuWeather and others. They've become quite advanced over the years and now even provide hyperlocal forecasts based on crowdsourced info, data pulled from deployed personal weather stations or both.

Those who would love to monitor rainfall and temperatures within their backyard or garden but prefer not to deal with lots of complex parts and hardware to set up, the $180 Netatmo Weather Station is the right choice. When you factor in all its extra modules you will pay more for the Netatmo system's convenience. Of course for techie folks who really get a kick out of weather events, it's hard to top the BloomSky Sky2 Weather Station's unique combination of traditional measurement instruments, smart home integration and bird's-eye view."
iDevices Wall Outlet review: (z2osi)|"

For $100, you can swap out one of your home's outlets with the Wi-Fi-enabled iDevices Wall Outlet. Make that upgrade, and you'll be able to turn each of its two outlets on and off independently, or program them to turn on and off automatically using the iDevices app on your Android or iOS device. You can also sync the Wall Outlet up with Apple HomeKit or with Amazon's Alexa to turn each outlet on and off using voice commands.

In other words, each outlet functions the same as one of iDevices' plug-in smart switches, right down to the fact that they'll track the energy usage of whatever you've got plugged in. The only difference, obviously, it that this is a hard-wired product -- it isn't anywhere near as flexible as the switch, which you can plug in anywhere.

On the other hand, smartening up your outlets makes for a connected living space that's a lot more seamless than one that's littered with blocky plugs all over the place. And, to the Wall Outlet's credit, it performed flawlessly in my tests at the CNET Smart Home. With just three wires to connect (line, neutral and ground), installing it was a relative cinch, and the integrations with Siri and Alexa both worked as advertised (there's even a little fold-down flap on the front of the outlet with the Apple HomeKit pairing code printed on it -- a nice, thoughtful touch). Add in the energy-tracking feature, and there's really not much else that I wish this thing was capable of.

In fact, I'll take it further: this is the best smart outlet you can buy right now. It works well, it's got a good slate of third-party integrations, it's easy to install, it doesn't need a hub and it's from an established name with a clear vision for the connected home.

Still, this thing is something of a niche product, and an expensive one at that. I can see the appeal for anyone who's ready to go all-in with smart home tech, but if you're a curious connected home beginner, then you're much better off just getting a plug-in smart switch to experiment with. The Belkin WeMo Mini, the iHome Smart Plug, and iDevices' own smart switch all cost less than half as much as the Wall Outlet -- I say start there and wait for prices to come down before worrying about your outlets."
Roost Smart Water Leak and Freeze Detector review: (d63x9)|"

The leak-detector market, ironically enough, is flooded with devices.

Most of the gadgets have the same basic design -- two probes that set off an alarm when they're connected by water. So, it's tough for a new entry to rise above the rest, which makes it all the more surprising that one just did.

The Roost Smart Water Leak and Freeze Detector costs $50 (that's about £40 or AU$65), placing it firmly in the middle of the leak detector price range. But the Roost's design surprised me by working better than most of the devices at the high end of the market.

The Roost detector is feature rich, as far as flood sensors go. It has two probes, running parallel in a loop around the base of the device, to sense water. It also tracks humidity and temperature, graphing them so you can see trends over a 24-hour or seven-day period.

The coils on the bottom of the Roost extend its range, and they don't rest on the ground, like the otherwise-impressive Fibaro Flood Sensor. Since the coils are slightly suspended, the detector won't set off a false alarm when placed in a drip pan, or on a similarly conductive surface.

The Roost's biggest feature is its Wi-Fi connection. Sensors without a Wi-Fi connection, such as SmartThings and Wink, require a smart hub, which is a barrier to entry for many people. The two best sensors that do connect directly to your phone via Wi-Fi are both solid products, but they're more expensive -- the D-Link costs $60, and the Honeywell clocks in at $80.

Between an easy setup, a solid set of features, and Wi-Fi connection, the Roost seems like the best option on the market right now. But a few drawbacks keep it from total domination. First, it doesn't work with any major smart home platforms, such as Apple HomeKit or Google Home. This isn't the end of the world but it does mean you'll need to download another app, which is kind of annoying to keep on your phone for a passive monitoring device.

The second big drawback is that the Roost isn't waterproof. While the detector isn't a totally leaky bucket, it certainly lets water in through the alarm's top speaker holes. A few drops of water splashed on these holes while I was testing the Roost and the alarm kept going off for nearly an hour -- even after I'd removed it from the water. More worryingly, the Roost sensor won't survive being submerged. So it's a one-shot deal in the case of serious flooding.

Despite its weaknesses, the Roost's strong design and feature-rich interface -- all for a comparably low price -- make it one of the most appealing devices on the market. If you don't already own a smart home hub, then the Roost and the D-Link should be the top two contenders for your flood sensor of choice."
Sense review: (qfmcb)|"

Editors' note (September 28, 2017): Since publishing this review, Sense has identified 14 new devices: the HVAC, the oven, ""unnamed heat 1,"" the microwave, ""unnamed device 1,"" ""unnamed motor 3,"" ""unnamed device 2,"" ""unnamed heat 2,"" the ice maker, a light, ""unnamed heat 3,"" ""unnamed device 3,"" ""unnamed device 4"" and a refrigerator. I'll continue to provide updates as it learns more.

The $299 Sense Home Energy Monitor (£240 and AU$390 at the current exchange rate) is supposed to bridge the gap between your utility-issued electric meters and detailed usage data. Sense successfully communicated whole-home watts at-a-glance during our testing. It also detected a few of the large appliances in the CNET Smart Home automatically. But like its competitor, Neurio, Sense had trouble identifying certain devices.

Sense's FAQ page says it's working on algorithms to detect more products, so it might get smarter soon. For now, if you're looking for in-depth data about your home energy consumption, this home energy tracker is pretty limited and I wouldn't readily recommend it.

All of the electricity-dependent products in your home contribute to a total watt (W) or kilowatt-hour (kWh) reading. (Note: one kWh is 1,000W.) At any given time, you should be able to see real-time energy stats on your home's electric meter. This info is then used by your local electric company to calculate the amount you owe.

But there's a problem. Meters, especially traditional non-digital units, are difficult to read -- and they only give you an overview of your consumption, rather than itemized watt or kilowatt-hour readouts of individual devices. That means you're out of luck if you want to better understand why last month's bill was so high.

Ideally, Sense should help you identify individual devices and figure out how to change your usage patterns. That's when you'll start to see savings and reduced strain on the electric grid.

The smallish rectangular Sense attaches to the main switch inside your breaker panel and relies on two sensors to detect unique device ""signatures."" While it took two electricians only 10 minutes to install Sense, this is not a do-it-yourself project. The installation requires the removal of the breaker panel and there are all sorts of potential shock hazards involved.

Sense is compatible with recessed and wall-mounted electric panels. It will work with more than one panel if Sense is installed in the main electrical panel and the additional panels are subpanels. Not sure if it will work in your home? Check out the Sense FAQ for more info before you buy.

Sense CEO Mike Phillips offered some insight on its device detection functionality via email:

According to Sense, products generating more energy are easier to single out, but it is possible for it to identify devices with a low 5W to 10W output.

That's where Sense differentiates itself from Neurio, which wasn't able to detect any appliances under 400W. Sense attributes its ability to detect low-wattage devices to the 4 million readings it takes per second to identify unique patterns. Theoretically, this should give Sense an edge over the competition.

After Sense is installed by a qualified professional, the device should chime to let you know the configuration was successful. Download the related Android or iPhone app and follow the instructions to connect it to your local Wi-Fi network. Sense doesn't currently have a web interface, so you're limited to viewing your energy stats on your mobile device.

You can view a graph or a bubble chart of the wattage output in your home 24/7 (assuming you have a solid Wi-Fi connection). Walk around your house and flip light switches on an off, cook dinner, run the dishwasher and see the visual representations change accordingly in the app.

You'll also get emails when Sense detects new devices, but it doesn't always happen quickly. Sense was installed on February 16. On March 3 and 14, I got emails saying Sense had ""learned new devices.""

So far, it has detected the dryer, two fridges and two ""unnamed motors."" Everything else currently lives in either the ""Always On"" or ""Unnamed"" device label. After more than a month of testing, I would have expected it to pick up on more appliances. Sense told me its ability to detect products can be slower if the Wi-Fi signal isn't strong. Our connection at the CNET Smart Home goes in and out. I just checked its speed and got 6.72 Mbps for download speed and 0.90 Mbps for upload speed. Not terrible, but not great.

Unfortunately, you can't really ""train"" your Sense device yourself. Instead, you have to wait for it to be certain it has identified a microwave or an air conditioner before it moves it from the ""unknown"" bubble to a specific label. Since you can't edit this information yourself, you're left waiting for Sense to catch up.  However, you can edit names of devices Sense identified as ""unnamed motors"" if you manage figure out what they are. I haven't had any luck with mine yet.

The IFTTT rule I created with Sense worked well, though. Sense is supposed to be able to ID things like garage door openers, so you could create the following IFTTT applet: ""If Sense notices the garage door is opening, then turn on my LED bulbs/adjust my thermostat/open my window shades."" Since I only had fridges and a dryer to work with my rule made a little less sense: ""If Sense notices the dryer turning off, then open the Lutron window shades."" Still, the applet worked fine.

Although Sense is supposed to be able to detect devices with lower wattage outputs than Neurio, these two products are fairly similar. Both have decent apps that display real-time energy stats for the whole home. Neurio has a more hands-on approach, allowing you to turn devices on and off and label them accordingly. Sense takes this on for you, but seems to do it fairly slowly (again, this can vary based on the quality of your Wi-Fi connection).

It might also matter that no one actually lives in the CNET Smart Home. We test products here every day, but  we aren't using the large appliances and smaller electronic devices the way someone living here would use them. Even so, I think five weeks should be enough time for Sense to identify the microwave, the HVAC unit and other electrical devices we use here day to day.

Sense costs $50 more than Neurio, but it hasn't managed to differentiate itself in any significant way over five weeks of testing. Usage stats are fairly limited and you don't have much control over how quickly it detects your appliances. It's a useful tool for real-time energy stats -- the house is currently using 576W of power, for instance.

I'm just not sold on spending $299 (plus the cost of an electrician) for a device that has only successfully identified two fridges and a dryer in over a month. I'd hold off to see how we like the competitor Curb and the Indiegogo-funded energy monitor Ecoisme."
Leviton Decora Smart Wi-Fi Plug-In Dimmer review: (fu8hm)|"

Let's say, for the sake of argument, that you own a lamp. You like this lamp, but it's either on or off, with nothing in between. You can't dim it, and you wish that you could. Better yet, you wish that you could dim it with a simple Alexa voice command on your  	Amazon Echo smart speaker  -- let's go ahead and say that you own one of those, too.

You've got a couple of options. One would be to pick up  	 	an Alexa-compatible smart bulb from a brand such as TP-Link, Lifx or Philips Hue. Another would be to smarten up the lamp itself.

This is where the Wi-Fi-enabled Leviton Decora plug-in dimmer comes in. Plug it in and plug that lamp of yours in behind it. You'll then be able to turn it on and off or dim it up and down remotely using the My Leviton app on your Android or iOS device, or by using Alexa voice commands. The asking price? $48 per plug.

That's a little steep for my tastes, especially considering you can pick up a  Belkin WeMo Mini smart switch for $35 or less. That switch won't let you dim the lights, but it boasts better third-party connections than the Decora lineup, and it also features a much, much less awkward design that doesn't block adjacent outlets or force you to plug your lamp in at an uncomfortable angle on the bottom of the device.

Still, the Decora plug has some good stuff going for it. Despite the fact that my phone   timed out during my first attempt at pairing with the plug, I came away impressed with the My Leviton app. It's simple to use, yet fully featured, with good controls for organizing multiple plugs by room and programming  automated lighting changes. You can also customize things like the lamp's dimmable range or the fade duration whenever you turn it on or off.

Many will also appreciate that the new Wi-Fi Decora devices speak the same language as your home network. That means you don't need to plug a hub into your router to act as translator.

Syncing up with Alexa is easy. Just enable the Leviton skill in the Alexa app and tell your Echo, Echo Dot or Tap to scan for new devices. From there,  you'll be able to tell Alexa to turn the lamp on or off or dim it up and down by using whatever name you gave it in the My Leviton app. Everything worked perfectly when I tested it out in   the CNET Smart Home.

There wasn't much else for me to test out, though. There's no IFTTT channel for these plugs, and no compatibility with Nest or any other notable third-party products or services. Leviton  plans to sync Decora up with Apple HomeKit this May to bring Siri controls into play -- but in a dumbfounding move, that HomeKit compatibility will be part of an entirely new yet otherwise identical line of Wi-Fi Decora devices.

In other words, buy it now and you'll miss out on HomeKit later. Names such as Ecobee and August have already learned the hard way that customers don't appreciate it when you separate features out like that -- now, Leviton is stepping on the same rake.

""There's a consumer misunderstanding that HomeKit is a feature to be added,"" explained Greg Rhoades, Director, Marketing, Energy Management, Controls and Automation at Leviton. ""In fact, it is an ecosystem and Leviton will provide a purely dedicated solution for these customers.""

""If a consumer absolutely wants the simplicity and benefits of Apple HomeKit and wants to connect the growing number of devices,"" he went on, ""then yes -- they should wait for those SKUs in April.""

In almost all cases, sticking with dimmable smart bulbs is a more cost-effective way of smartening up the lamps around your home. A fully dimmable, Alexa-compatible two-bulb   Philips Hue White starter kit costs $70 with additional bulbs costing just $15 each. I'd need a very good reason to go with Leviton over an option like that.

Sobro coffee table charges phones, plays tracks and chills drinks (aydhr)|"

The world has seen ideas for smart coolers, but how about a smart coffee table?  Thanks to the $1,000 Storebound Sobro, that day my friends is at hand. According to Storebound, the Sobro isn't your ordinary piece of living room furniture. The Sobro plays music, charges laptops and phones, plus conceals a small refrigerator for cold beverages.

To provide audio the Sobro functions as a wireless Bluetooth speaker for phones, tablets, even HDTVs. It has numerous USB ports and AC outlets for filling up thirsty electric batteries as well. Literally the coolest of the Sobro's features is a small fridge tucked away inside its main drawer. It's designed to hold your favorite drink of choice.

Touch controls for the Sobro live on the table's top right-hand side corner. They command the table's audio playback and also activate its array of color shifting LED lights. Storebound expects the Sobro to ship by September 2017 for its full price of $1,000. You do have the option of preordering the coffee table as an Indiegogo backer for as little as $500.

Philips gives your candelabra bulbs some color... finally (fjg4y)|"

Philips Hue has long vied for domination of the smart LED lighting market, and it's leading the charge into color-changing candelabra bulbs ($154.99 at Amazon.com), too. Up until now, the best smart LED bulbs that would fit into most chandeliers or ceiling fans came from Feit, a smaller-name company with only middling candelabra bulbs.

Although we haven't tested the new Philips bulbs yet, the company's record should give people hope. Its new White and Color Ambiance Candle bulbs will be available in Europe starting in April, and in North America later this year. (We don't yet know if it'll come to Australia.) The downside is that the Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Candle bulb will cost $50 (or about £40 or AU$65), which is significantly more than many competing bulbs (which often cost closer to $10).

The big advantage the Hue Candle bulbs have is the existing Hue ecosystem -- a system compatible with HomeKit, Google Home and Amazon Echo. You'll be able to control the Candle bulbs along with other Hue bulbs using voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa.

At this time, the Hue Candle bulbs won't be included in lighting kits, like this Philips Hue Starter Kit. That means people already invested in the Hue ecosystem will likely be the earliest adopters.

Here are the specs for the White and Color Candle bulbs:

Viio Vezzo review: (2kucb)|"

Bathroom mirrors seem like the perfect place to add smarts: think touchscreens, voice assistants, maybe even personalized beauty tips. Sure, we're not quite there yet, but the $400 Viio Vezzo Bluetooth Mirror does take that first step toward connectivity (although the Vezzo doesn't ship to the UK or Australia yet, its pricing converts to about £330 and AU$530).

In light of the promise of such technology, though, the Vezzo falls disappointingly short. It offers a few useful features, but they fail to cohere in any compelling way. And worst of all, the mirror -- an inherently visual object -- boasts no visual components, instead relying on Bluetooth speakers to stand out on the market.

For now, unless you crave the Vezzo's exact cocktail of features, you'll want to keep your money and wait for a truly smart mirror to revolutionize your bathroom.

The Vezzo is a 24-inch by 32-inch mirror that includes a border light for makeup work, an anti-fog button for when things get steamy and a Bluetooth button for connecting your phone. Between these three primary features, it's a surprisingly simple device.

That simplicity contributes to a sleek design. The Vezzo looks modern, but blends surprisingly well with a variety of decors. The mirror is powered directly, using a plug for the outlet you typically find beside vanities. Of course, anyone who uses a blow dryer, straightener, trimmer or any number of other grooming gadgets knows those outlets are a hot commodity. Luckily, you can unplug the mirror for 6 hours at a time, as it has a backup battery.

The Vezzo's biggest strength is its ease of use. After a relatively quick install -- you have to anchor the mirror to the wall using a thin metal plate -- just tap one of the three touch-sensitive buttons on the front to activate the features.

That's right: the Vezzo doesn't even have an app. When I realized this, I was simultaneously intrigued by the decidedly simple interface and disappointed by the Vezzo's meager features.

The Vezzo costs $400. A speaker comparable to the Vezzo's costs well under $100. Mirrors with similar LED lighting and anti-fog features cost around $290. So it's not a bad deal for the whole package. The problem is, none of the features stand out and they don't work especially well in tandem.

Here's what I mean:

Moreover, a hanging mirror like the Vezzo works best for a half bathroom -- where steam isn't much of an issue, you probably won't be applying makeup often and you won't be spending tons of time listening to audiobooks. In other words, the Vezzo's design and features seem to be working at cross-purposes. In the end, the Vezzo feels like a more polished MacGyver gadget -- a half-bath mirror with some full-bath features tacked on. And even if it does work in some full bathrooms, none of its features make it feel new or essential.

While reviewing the Vezzo, I had to actively resist my expectations for what a ""smart"" mirror should be. Why knock a product that isn't trying to be what you expected it to be? But the promise of a connected mirror is inescapable: you don't spend mornings listening to mirrors -- you spend mornings looking at them. Without something like a touchscreen, or even just visualized weather or traffic updates, the whole device feels a little underwhelming.

The Vezzo isn't for everyone, but it's also not a terrible product. If you need LED lighting and anti-fog features on a hanging mirror, it isn't a bad deal. Throw in a middling Bluetooth speaker, and it might be a device worth considering.

But if you're looking for something special -- or even just a device with solid speakers, don't buy Viio's Bluetooth Mirror. Wait for something better.

The light helps brighten your face from all angles for detail work, but it doesn't offer color temperature variation like the SimpleHuman Mirror to help users replicate the natural light of their daily surroundings.The anti-fog button works by heating the glass to above the room's dew point, but you have to hit it 10 to 20 minutes before the room steams up for it to work effectively.The Bluetooth button lets you listen to music, the news, audiobooks and whatever else you can access on your phone -- but the quality of the speakers is far lower than a good $100 Bluetooth speaker.The mirror even includes a microphone, so you can take phone calls on it -- cool, right? But it doesn't connect with Wi-Fi to integrate a voice assistant, which would add a ton of appeal to an otherwise rather un-smart mirror. Even without Alexa or Google Assistant, something as simple as Spotify streaming would've been a welcome addition."
Fremo Evo Battery Base for Amazon Echo Dot review: (nai18)|"

The Amazon Echo Dot is a pint-size, puck-shaped version of the original, full-size Amazon Echo smart speaker. It's a low-cost access point for the Alexa voice assistant that can connect with external speakers via Bluetooth or via line-in jack, but it doesn't have a built-in battery. That means that you'll need to keep it plugged in -- and that you can't take it with you for room-to-room listening on the go.

The Fremo Evo wants to help you change that. At $35, or £45 in the UK, it's a battery base for the second-gen Echo Dot that lets Alexa go unplugged for up to a stated six hours of battery-powered playback. Combine that with the $50/£50 you'll spend on an Echo Dot, and you're looking at a portable, voice-activated Alexa speaker for about 35 percent less than what you'd spend on Amazon's own battery-powered Alexa speaker, the Echo Tap.

That's a good deal (especially in the UK, where the Tap isn't even available), but keep in mind that the Dot has by far the weakest sound quality of Amazon's Alexa speakers -- barely much better than the speakers in your phone. And, though you can't activate it with your voice,  	Fabriq's third-party Alexa speaker offers the same portable approach complete with better sound and a better design -- all for just $50 flat.

Still, the Evo worked exceptionally well in my tests, with battery life that far exceeds the stated six hours of promised playback. It isn't quite as convenient as the Tap, but people who already own an Echo Dot and just want to take Alexa out on the porch with them every now and then should love this thing.

The Evo keeps it simple -- just set the Echo Dot on top of it and connect the two using a dual-pronged adapter. You'll power it using your existing Echo Dot cable, then unplug whenever you want to take your speaker somewhere else.

The Evo comes in both white and black to match the color of your device, but it still compromises the Dot's clean, uniform design somewhat. Rigid teeth around the top of the battery form a sort of crown that the Dot sits in -- they're designed to prevent the battery from blocking off the speakers around the Dot's bottom rim. They work as promised, ensuring that the sound still gets out, but they also look a little janky compared with a plain Dot.

The front of the battery features four white LEDs that serve as battery indicators. The battery is fully charged when all four are lit -- from there, they'll drop out one by one as the juice runs out. Again, Fremo claims that'll take at least six hours of continuous playback.

My tests bear that claim out -- and then some, to put it mildly. After giving the base a full charge, I attached an Echo Dot, then unplugged it and left it playing at full volume. Six hours later, it was still going strong, with three of those four battery indicators still lit up.

I ended up taking the speaker home with me to continue my tests. It kept on streaming my Spotify tunes for another several hours, finally running dry at three in the morning after roughly 13 hours of continuous use (save for about 30 minutes on standby as I drove home from the office with it). Afterward, it recharged in about four and a half hours.

Both of those are terrific results, and as I tested the Evo out, taking my Echo Dot around the house to listen to podcasts while in the shower or some music while I cooked dinner, I could absolutely see the product's appeal.

That said, it's not as elegant an option as the Amazon Tap ($129.99 at Amazon.com), which sits in a base to recharge. When you want to take it with you, you just pick it up and go, and when you're done, you just set it back in the base. You don't need to worry about the cable at all.

To that end, a higher-end version of the Evo or something similar with a separate charging base might be a product worth waiting for. You might also consider spending a little extra on a  battery base that doubles as an enhanced speaker, given the Dot's relatively limited sound output. The Evo doesn't do anything to improve the Dot's volume or sound quality.

Still, I like the Evo, and with its impressive battery life and relatively low price, I think it merits a look from Echo Dot owners who are happy with their speaker's native sound output but who wish they could take it with them around the house."
Zmodo Torch Pro review: (3hy92)|"

Zmodo's $200 Torch Pro -- roughly £165 and AU$265 converted -- is actually three separate products. You get a 720p camera hidden inside a color-changing outdoor LED, a motion-detector-equipped wired doorbell and a plug-in indoor Wi-Fi range extender. All of this stuff worked pretty well with the related Android or iPhone app to keep tabs on my front door.

But there's a big problem. The camera light is gigantic and wouldn't fit in any of the porch lights at my house or at the CNET Smart Home. The system also doesn't currently work with any smart home platforms and the app configuration and overall layout is confusing. The Torch Pro is an interesting concept with fine performance, but is ultimately much too unwieldy to recommend.

The Zmodo Torch Pro security light clocks in at 5.51 inches tall and 2.95 inches wide. Rather than having a traditional tapered shape, this light is roughly the same width from top to bottom -- with the exception of its smaller E26 socket. For this reason, it simply won't fit into most small- or medium-sized outdoor light fixtures.

I even ventured to a home improvement store to try it with various porch lights on display. Even with dozens of options to choose from, it would only fit in the largest models. And, if the bottom of the porch light has a tapered design, you'll probably be completely out of luck regardless of size (this happened with the porch lights at the CNET Smart Home -- see the image to the right).

Installation should have been simple, but I never managed to find a ready-installed light fixture big enough to support this device. Instead, I screwed it into an indoor table lamp for testing.

The color-changing LED claims a brightness rating of 350 lumens, a 5,000K color temperature and 100,000 hours of runtime. Those specs are roughly comparable to the Philips 40W Equivalent Candelabra LED. A 40W  replacement LED isn't very bright in terms of output. For comparison, brighter 60W replacement LEDs typically have at least 800 lumens and 100W replacement LEDs typically have at least 1,600 lumens.

Even so, the light looked bright enough when I dragged the indoor table lamp outside. It helps that it's designed for use in a porch light surrounded by glass rather than in a lamp diffused by a shade. You can dim the light and adjust its color in the Zmodo app. You can also set an on/off schedule so the lights turn on and off and any custom color settings adjust automatically.

You can pull up a live feed from the light's built-in 720p, 132-degree camera. Whenever the light is on, the camera will automatically display in night vision mode and revert to day mode when the light turns off.

While the security light provides visibility, the wired doorbell detects motion.  If you're familiar with standard doorbell wiring, you can definitely install the Zmodo buzzer yourself. It took our technical editor, Steve, only 15 minutes to remove the existing doorbell and replace it with the Zmodo model. It probably would have taken me closer to 30 minutes from start to finish. Of course, if you're iffy on this process, always consult a professional. A battery-powered design for the Zmodo doorbell would obviously be easier, but it wouldn't be practical given the power demands of continuous video streaming.

Whenever the doorbell detects activity, it sends a push alert to your phone. Click on the alert to pull up a live feed from the camera light and use the two-way audio feature in the doorbell to talk.

All of this functionality worked well, for the most part. I received prompt motion alerts, was able to quickly pull up a live video feed on the camera app -- and the scheduling function automatically adjusted the light settings to my exact specifications. The two way talk feature was pretty hit-or-miss, though, with poor audio quality on both ends.

The bigger problem was getting everything configured in the app in the first place. Both the instructions from the box and the app were confusing. Basically, there are three main connection methods and the app doesn't tell you which one you need, so you're left guessing (see the screenshot below).

After about an hour without any luck, I called customer service and they helped me connect everything very quickly. Still, this sort of set up shouldn't be that complex. And even after you connect everything, the cluttered app layout makes it difficult to find what you're looking for.

In terms of connected porch-light-style security systems, the Kuna and the Toucan both do a better job. The Kuna is a porch light with an integrated camera, whereas the Toucan is a camera accessory that attaches to existing porch lights. They work with regular non-smart bulbs, but the related apps offer advanced integrations between the light and the camera. Like the Torch Pro, these products don't work with IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, or any other smart home platforms.

Zmodo markets its $200/£165/AU$265 Torch Pro as a simple system for your DIY smart home. But due to the size of its security light, you'll probably have to buy and install a larger light fixture just to accommodate it. The app setup and overall layout needs work, too, and the Torch Pro doesn't currently work with any smart home platforms. I'd strongly suggest looking at either the  Kuna or the Toucan porch light security cameras instead."

I've often wondered what mischief my dog gets into when I'm not home. I could install a camera to keep an eye on her, but that would only cover a single room and she's a pretty active pup.

Fortunately, startup Pebby might have a fix. Its $124 (roughly £100, AU$165 converted) PebbyBall, PebbyKennel and PebbyCollar pet monitoring kit promises to watch over your dog or cat, while simultaneously keeping them entertained.

Here's how it's supposed to work. The PebbyBall is a small, lithium-ion-powered robot covered in a polycarbonate shell that's supposedly ""shatterproof"" and ""waterproof."" Your dog or cat can bat around this 3-inch robo-ball just like any other toy, but there are also some hidden smarts inside. You can set the PebbyBall to ""Auto-Play,"" ""Auto-Follow"" or ""Auto-Repel"" mode or use the related Pebby app on your Android or iOS device to control the ball yourself.

The PebbyBall also has a built-in 720p high definition night vision camera inside. That means you should be able to view a live video feed and even talk to your pet via its two-way intercom function. I'm not sure how well a rolling ball would be able to capture video, but it's designed to run for up to 1.5 hours of active time and 15 hours in standby mode. When your PebbyBall's battery is low, it's supposed to return to the PebbyKennel charging dock just like a robot vacuum.

The PebbyCollar completes the Pebby kit. This little gizmo goes on your pet's collar and is supposed to track their activity and give you an overview in the app. Its rechargeable battery should last for up to 12 days. We haven't seen anything quite like Pebby before, but smart pet tech is definitely on the rise. I recently tested the Petnet Smartfeeder, a food bowl that distributes a certain amount of dry food on a daily schedule.

Pebby has just started its Kickstarter campaign with an overall goal of $50,000. The earliest backers can snag a PebbyBall, Kennel and Collar for $124, kits ship anywhere and the estimated product delivery date is July 2017."
Samsung SmartCam PT review:|"

Editors' note: Researchers found a bug with SmartCam model SNH-1011 in January 2017 that temporarily made it more susceptible to hacks. Samsung has since issued a firmware update to address the problem. The Samsung SmartCam PT was not part of this reported security flaw.

Samsung's $229 (£185 and AU$300, converted) SmartCam PT is a decent DIY security camera. It offers cloud and local storage, solid motion zones and motion tracking via an integrated pan-tilt lens, as well as a privacy mode you can schedule based on your daily routine.

Its default motion- and audio-sensor settings were way too sensitive at the outset, but a quick adjustment in the app made them a little more reliable. The bigger problem is that I haven't seen any real advancement in the SmartCam line in three years. The smart-home security market has grown so much since I tested the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro in early 2014. But we're still stuck with the same outdated, annoying-to-navigate SmartCam app and no smart home integrations whatsoever.

Given that Samsung owns the SmartThings smart home platform, I'm stumped as to why the SmartCam PT doesn't work with more products from other manufacturers, or at least SmartThings' own connected accessories. The SmartCam PT's lack of integrations and relatively high price ultimately make it impossible to recommend.

The SmartCam PT is surprisingly compact, particularly for a pan-tilt camera. Because pan-tilt models need to, well, pan and tilt, their hardware has to include mechanisms that allow for movement. As a result, they typically have clunkier, more utilitarian designs than their fixed-angle counterparts, like the Nest Cam Indoor.

The SmartCam PT isn't any more stylish than Foscam's Plug and Play FI9826P or D-Link's Pan & Tilt Network Camera, but its small size does make it a more discreet addition to a home.

Here are the SmartCam PT's key features:

Adding your SmartCam PT to the SmartCam Android or iPhone app is as simple as you'd expect. Create an account, and follow the instructions to get the camera online. This process took me about 10 minutes, mainly because one of the steps requires waiting up to three minutes for the camera's status LED to change from blue to green.

Inside the app, you can view the live feed, set your motion zones, opt-in to motion tracking and more. The problem is finding everything. Not only does the app look like it was designed in the early days of the internet, it also isn't organized in a particularly logical way. You'll get used to the layout over time, but the ideal scenario is an app that both looks nice and makes it easy for you to find the information you need. You won't find that here.

The SmartCam PT performed pretty well, delivering speedy alerts when the audio or motion sensors detected activity. The notifications arrived far too close together at first, picking up on the slightest sound and movement. Fortunately, you can adjust the audio and motion sensitivity in the app, and this helped to some extent.

The motion-tracking feature worked reliably most of the time, but it never noticed me when I was more than about 10 feet away from the camera. And, when motion tracking is enabled, regular audio- and motion-sensor detection and related alerts are automatically disabled. Still, motion tracking worked much better here than it did with the $80 Ezviz Mini 360 Plus.

You can easily view recorded activity clips in the app via cloud storage or local microSD card storage. Use a microSD card reader to download any clips you'd like to save.

Even if you don't care about smart-home integrations, I wouldn't recommend the $229 Samsung SmartCam PT. The app is tricky to navigate, the audio and motion sensors are somewhat unreliable and it costs more than your average DIY home security camera. You can find it on Amazon for just $175, but I still think that's too high for what it offers.

Kwikset Kevo Convert Bluetooth Smart Lock review:|"

""The lock just flashed at me."" 	 	 	 	 	 	""Yeah,"" I told my roommate, Zach. ""It's a status indicator. Green means unlocked. I can turn it off in the app if it's bothering you."" 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Zach sighed. ""Whatever.""

So it goes at Casa Crist, where I occasionally bring home a smart-home gadget to test for a few days. The latest: the Kwikset Kevo Convert Bluetooth Smart Lock. At $150, it's cheaper than most other smart locks on the market, and unlike many of them, it doesn't actually replace your existing lock. Instead, you'll install it on the inside of your door, where it will automatically lock or unlock your deadbolt whenever you tell it to using the Kevo app on your Android or iOS device.

The Convert's retrofit approach makes it an appealing pick for renters who aren't allowed to swap their deadbolt out (and for an indifferent roommate like Zach, who'd rather just stick with the key he's already got). It also worked reliably well during the week or so I tested it, with a steady Bluetooth connection to my phone and an integration with my  	 	 	Nest Learning Thermostat that let me toggle the thermostat between Home and Away modes whenever I unlocked or locked the door.

There are compromises here, though -- namely, the need to be within Bluetooth range to check the Convert's status on your phone or lock it remotely. The third-party integrations with Nest and IFTTT also didn't go as deep as I'd like, and you can't connect it with any other smart home platforms -- no Wink or SmartThings, no Apple HomeKit and no Amazon Alexa, either. I like the Convert as a means of sharing digital access to your door, but at $150, I wish it didn't feel quite so limited.

The Convert is really just the interior half of the original Kwikset Kevo -- the part with the Bluetooth radio, the motorized lock-turning mechanism and the battery pack that powers it. You don't get the original Kevo's touch-to-open feature, but you do get its same baseline smarts that you control with the same Kevo app.

Looks-wise, the Convert is clean and simple, if not striking. It's smaller than the interior of other smart locks from names like Yale and Schlage, but only very slightly so. It's not nearly as eye-catching as the  	 	August Smart Lock, which takes a similar retrofit approach, but it's definitely not an eyesore, either.

Before you jump in with the Convert (or with any smart lock that automatically turns your deadbolt),     you'll want to check your door to make sure it's smart-lock-compatible. Here's what to look for:

You'll also want to make sure that the Convert is compatible with your Android or iOS device -- particularly on the Android side,     where Android 5.0 or better is required.

I had absolutely no trouble installing the Convert on my front door, thanks in large part to the detailed, illustrated step-by-step instructions in the Kevo app. All I needed was a screwdriver and about 10 minutes.

The fact that my front door uses a Kwikset deadbolt likely helped my installation, but the Convert will work with other kinds of locks, too. It even comes with multiple sets of parts and adapters -- and again, the app does a great job of helping you through the process.

Once the Convert is successfully affixed to your door, you'll pair with it over Bluetooth using the Kevo app. From there, you'll be able to check the lock's status on your phone or lock and unlock it remotely, provided you're within Bluetooth range. You'll also be able to share ""eKeys"" that authorize other people to control the lock, too.

An existing standard deadbolt that sits separately above the knob or handleA door that's between 1 3/8 and 1 3/4 inches (38mm and 44mm) thickProper alignment with the doorframe -- you shouldn't need to push or pull on the doorknob in order to turn the lock

So why would you want a Bluetooth connection to your deadbolt? Here are some of the most common scenarios:

All of that worked perfectly when I tested it, but there are a couple of caveats to keep in mind. The most obvious is that you can't control the lock or view its status from outside of Bluetooth range. You also can't connect it with a third-party smart home platform like Wink or SmartThings to extend the range, the way you can with competing smart locks (including Kwikset's own Z-Wave models). The only way to do so with the Convert is to buy the   Kevo Plus Wi-Fi plug-in gateway device for an extra $100. And no, spending that kind of money on a hub that only controls one kind of gadget doesn't feel like a good deal to me, either.

Another limitation: There's no way to control this lock with your voice. It doesn't work with Apple HomeKit, which rules Siri out. Even though Amazon now offers developers   dedicated smart-lock programming tools, the Convert won't work with Alexa either. All's quiet on the Google Assistant front, too.

Still, there's a lot that this lock gets right. In particular, the Kevo app does a great job with user management, offering easy controls for emailing eKeys to friends and contacts. I especially appreciated how easy it was to set time restrictions on those eKeys, including fully customizable Scheduled eKeys that only work on the days and times you set, as well as Guest eKeys that simply stop working after 24 hours. Best of all: Kwikset doesn't charge fees for those eKeys anymore. All of them are totally free and unlimited.

The lock history section of the app is another nice touch. It offers users an accurate and detailed list of comings and goings. It only works with app-enabled entry, though -- use your key to get in, or lock the door by turning the deadbolt by hand, and it won't show up in the app.

The Convert also takes advantage of the original Kevo's third-party smart-home integrations -- namely with Nest, IFTTT and video doorbells from SkyBell and Ring. The Nest integration worked fine, with a little pop-up that would ask me if I wanted to toggle my thermostat between Away mode and Home mode whenever I'd use the Kevo app to lock or unlock my door. But again, that only works if you're using the app to control the lock.

The IFTTT integration was much less successful. The Kevo channel is limited to begin with -- it only lets you trigger IFTTT recipes by locking or unlocking your door using the app. And while you can use the Convert to trigger your IFTTT recipes, you can't use your IFTTT recipes to trigger the Convert. That eliminates a potential workaround for things like Alexa voice locking.

Worse still, my test recipes didn't work. I suspect this has to do with the fact that IFTTT uses your phone as a relay to connect with the lock itself, and maybe the recipes would have worked like a charm if I had a Kevo Plus installed to play the role of relay, instead. Still, if you count IFTTT compatibility as a key selling point, temper your expectations.

Limitations aside, I like the Kevo Convert. I think it's a good fit for renters, and a perfectly fine choice for anyone who wants a simple smart lock that can manage access across multiple users. The retrofit design makes it a direct competitor to the   August Smart Lock, one of our favorites in the category. The Convert offers many of the same features at a lower price.

But the Convert demands compromises, too. At a time when more and more smart locks are offering integrations that will let you include them in a larger home automation platform or control them with voice commands, the Convert sticks with a basic, Bluetooth approach that largely silos itself off from the rest of the smart home. That's fine if all you want is basic user access control. But if you're thinking bigger, you'll want to look elsewhere.

D-Link Omna review:|"

Editors' note (September 28, 2017): D-Link's Omna now works with Android devices.

The $200 (£160 and AU$260 converted) 1080p HD D-Link Omna is a fine security camera, delivering prompt motion alerts and storing activity locally on a microSD card. It's also the first camera to work with Apple's smart home platform, HomeKit.

Yes, this integration is a milestone for the iOS 10 software, but HomeKit still has far fewer integrations than competitors like Amazon Alexa. You can still set up automations within Apple's Home app that link the motion sensor inside the Omna to select HomeKit devices, but there just isn't much feature depth here (yet). Because of that limitation, the ability to view your Omna camera's live feed from Apple's Home app isn't hugely appealing today.

The Omna is very much a niche product, one that only makes sense for early HomeKit adopters who don't mind waiting for broader, better integrations.

The Omna has a light silver-gray finish and a tall cylindrical design, with access to a microSD card slot on the bottom (it supports up to a 128GB microSD card, which isn't included). It's a fine looking camera, but D-Link's hardware choices don't necessarily make it easier to use.

Conversely, the Nest Cam Indoor has an extremely thoughtful layout. Its durable but flexible magnetic base twists and rotates with ease, and you can separate the camera from its base for a more permanent wall-mount installation. In other words, the Nest Cam's design enhances its usability.

The Omna's design is much less modular than the Nest Cam's. It doesn't have a flexible base, and you don't have the option of mounting this camera to a wall. You have to put your Omna on a flat surface, or nothing at all.

Curious how the Omna's specs compare to other DIY cams? Take a peek at the chart below:

Aside from its 1080p high-definition video streaming resolution and HomeKit compatibility, the Omna camera's main selling point is its 180-degree field of view. This wide-angle lens sees more than the Nest Cam Indoor, the Netgear Arlo Pro and many other DIY cams on the market. The video gets somewhat distorted at the far corners of the feed, but that's a common issue with 180-degree lenses. That problem was even more exaggerated with the Piper Classic and NV security systems we tested.

The Omna also offers local storage, which is a significant deviation from many of the mainstream models' optional cloud subscription services. Here's an overview of local versus cloud storage, but the gist is that local storage doesn't pass through a remote server. Instead, your video footage stays in your house. One major complaint about local storage relates to theft -- it's a lot easier to steal a microSD card than it is to access a remote server's video cache. On the other hand, you don't have to worry about the reliability or security limitations of a distant server.

Finally, D-Link's Omna doesn't currently have an Android app. Since it's a HomeKit device, that isn't incredibly surprising. But plenty of HomeKit-enabled products are versatile enough to work with both Android and iOS -- you'd just ignore the HomeKit component if you're an Android customer. August's second-generation Smart Lock immediately comes to mind as an example.

But this just isn't the case with the Omna. Even the Omna's native app -- also called Omna -- is heavily tied to HomeKit in terms of design and configuration. If you aren't invested in HomeKit, the Omna camera really isn't for you.

The Omna iPhone app doesn't have a login or a registration process. You don't have to enter your email address and wait for a confirmation message to appear in your inbox. Nada.

Instead, you simply open the app and select ""Add Accessory."" Make sure your Omna cam is powered on and that the mobile device you're using for configuration is on the local network you plan to connect to your camera. Then, you wait for the app to recognize the Omna camera. This didn't work for me right away, so I moved closer to the camera, and presto! (See screenshot below.)

Continue to follow the instructions in the app, including scanning the HomeKit code located on the camera and adding the camera and its built-in motion detector to specific rooms in your house. I tested my Omna in the CNET Smart Home living room and labeled it accordingly.

Now, you're ready to use your camera in the Omna app or in the Home app. The camera and its motion sensor should populate in the Home app automatically as two separate ""accessories."" The Omna app allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor and set motion zones. The Home app doesn't have this functionality, but you can view the camera's live feed from the Home app and incorporate the camera into select automations.

I created automations based on the Omna motion sensor detecting activity, such as, ""If the Omna detects motion, then turn on all the lights."" I was also able to ask Siri for the status of my security camera or for the status of my motion detector, which would either pull up the Omna's live feed in the Home app or simply reply that the motion sensor either was or wasn't currently detecting activity.

The motion detector and the related push alerts were responsive. The recorded video clips were easy to view in the app -- or view and download using a microSD card reader. The motion detection zones also helped me turn off detection in the area where our large Haiku ceiling fan is located in the living room. But the overall video quality wasn't quite as crisp as the Nest Cam's 1080p. Check out the two screenshots below to compare the Omna's live feed to the Nest Cam's. The Omna can clearly see more of the room, but the Nest Cam's picture quality is slightly better (even though they both claim 1080p HD).

D-Link's $200 Omna is a decent security camera. Its live feed and related alerts were reliable. Its motion detection zones made it simple to focus only on certain areas. Its 180-degree field of view lets you see more of a room, although you'll deal with some picture distortion as a trade-off. And the Omna's local microSD card storage gives you more control over your video clips.

The Omna is the first camera available for retail that works with Apple's HomeKit platform. While that opens up the Omna to integrations with other HomeKit devices and some Siri voice commands, Apple's smart home software is still behind the curve in terms of product partners. For that reason, the Home app doesn't offer the breadth of integrations I hoped to see at this stage in the smart home game. If you're already invested in HomeKit, the Omna makes a fine choice. Everyone else should hold off and see what's on the horizon."
Petnet SmartFeeder review:|"

Let me get this out of the way up front -- my husband and I spoil the crap out of our dog, Halley. We buy her overpriced toys she sometimes shreds in minutes; we relinquish large sections of the couch to her when we watch a movie; we generally find it charming when she covertly rolls in a mud puddle...

And, like all pet owners, we also care a lot about her health and strive to balance her high energy demands with the right amount of quality kibble.

Enter Petnet's SmartFeeder. Not only is this $149 product designed to hold up to 7 pounds of dry dog or cat food and auto-dispense designated amounts on a fixed schedule, the related app also weighs in on how much you should feed your pet. It even offers up a ""Food Report Card"" with a detailed nutritional profile of your pet's chow.

I know $149 is a lot to dish out for a food bowl, but we're just the type of overzealous dog people to consider it. My week-long testing experience didn't at all match up with the SmartFeeder's promises, though. Inaccurate dispensing, feeder jams, an odd design that made it difficult for Halley to reach all of her food and an occasionally glitchy app seriously damaged the SmartFeeder's initial appeal. Consider an alternative product or wait for Petnet to improve its current design before you buy.

Petnet's SmartFeeder is a Wi-Fi food bowl for dogs and cats with an automatic dispenser and a related Android and iPhone app. Pour up to 7 pounds of dry food in the reservoir and close the lid -- Petnet stipulates that the food should measure between 1/8 and 5/8 inches in diameter and the SmartFeeder can dispense between 1/16- and 1 1/2-cup portions per feeding. Because of its dispensing limitations and smaller bowl size, this product is recommended only for small or medium-sized dogs under 50 pounds.

Installation is simple -- follow the guide to connect the food bowl and its stainless steel insert to the rest of the SmartFeeder. Your purchase includes an 8-foot ""chew resistant"" power adapter, but it can also run on rechargeable battery power for roughly 7 hours. The feeder is fairly large at 15.32 inches tall, but it has a modern design that looked good in our home. And its lid has childproof-style locking tabs that you slide out to open, ensuring that your pet won't be able access it easily.

App configuration was similarly straightforward. Download the app, create an account, verify your account through your email, assemble the SmartFeeder using the step-by-step instructions and enter in details about your pet. This includes the specific brand and type of food your pet eats, as well as how often you feed them and how many cups you give them per meal. You can adjust the amount manually, but the app will also offer a suggested quantity using the details you provided earlier.

Petnet also works with Nest Cam Indoor. Nest Cam customers who also subscribe to the optional Nest Aware video recording service can view video footage of their pet eating in the Petnet app. While you can opt-in to receive alerts when your pet's food is dispensed, this Nest integration is supposed to offer a second level of confirmation that your pet was fed.

This all sounds pretty good, but how does the SmartFeeder compare to other pet feeders in terms of price and features? The category varies widely from $10 food and water dispensers that aren't smart, but will refill the bowl when it's empty to $100+ smart feeders like Petnet's.

One interesting SmartFeeder competitor, the $110 RolliTron RolliPet Pet Feeder, actually has a built-in 720p high-definition camera. So instead of buying the $149 Petnet SmartFeeder and the $200 Nest Cam Indoor separately, RolliTron theoretically offers similar functionality from a single device -- and for less money overall. I haven't tested RolliTron or any other smart pet feeders yet (aside from the Petnet SmartFeeder), but it certainly seems like an interesting alternative device.

More often than not Halley's food arrived as scheduled and in the correct amount. I even received a prompt, related alert telling me ""Halley was fed 1 1/4 cups of food at 6:15 am/6pm."" But the food never once fully dispensed into the bowl. Instead, a significant portion remained in a hard-to-reach space between the food reservoir and the bowl.

Halley eats Nutro ""Small Bites,"" rounded small pieces of food that conform to Petnet's guidelines for chow. Even so, this was a consistent problem.

A Petnet representative told me I could schedule two consecutive feedings to prevent the problem, which might also be more likely to happen if you're dispensing close to the 1 1/2-cup maximum meal portion. Since Petnet had suggested we feed Halley 1 1/4 cups per meal, I tried reducing the feedings to 3/4 cups. But a lot of food still remained in the feeder where Halley couldn't reach.

I also tried with a couple additional types of food of different shapes and sizes -- same problem. At one point, the food collecting in the feeder caused a jam and Halley only got some of her food.

Petnet is aware of this issue and offers a ramp device to angle the SmartFeeder roughly 12 degrees for free -- just enough to push the food forward. This contraption helped, but it isn't included with your purchase so you'll likely need to rig your own wedge or reach out to Petnet's customer service to get their version. This Amazon user's video review of the SmartFeeder from March 2016 relied on binders underneath the product to create a wedge. While these clever workarounds do the trick (more or less), there's still a significant flaw with the SmartFeeder's core design.

I also experienced a couple of odd glitches during testing -- the SmartFeeder dispensed food at the right time, but the timestamp on the related alert was off by 3 hours. The Petnet app controls the timezone automatically, so I'm not sure why it thought I was in the Pacific time zone for those two feedings.

On another occasion, Halley didn't get any food and no related alert appeared to let us know there was a problem. (This is when it would be handy to have a camera monitoring feedings.)

Petnet said this was likely due to a firmware update that could have caused an outage and interrupted feedings. Related to that, customers don't have control over when software updates are pushed live, so it could potentially happen unexpectedly during your pet's feeding. A representative told me Petnet normally issues firmware updates at night when most SmartFeeders aren't in use. But that certainly wasn't the case with Halley's 6:15am breakfast feeding.

On the occasion that we're late getting home, I wanted Petnet's $149 SmartFeeder to swoop in and handle Halley's dinner for us. The added benefit of nutritional data and suggested portion amounts also appealed to me. But the dispenser and related app integrations just weren't consistent enough.

I definitely don't want to worry that my dog didn't get fed because of a scheduled firmware update, however infrequent. I also don't want to have to buy a Nest Cam to confirm whether or not a feeding happened -- or shove a binder under it to create the right angle for proper food dispensation. Skip Petnet's SmartFeeder and look instead to another Wi-Fi feeder or simply stick to the old fashioned method -- feeding your pet yourself."
U by Moen Smart Shower review:|"

This morning, I hit a button on the U by Moen app on my phone and turned on my shower. I hadn't even entered the bathroom yet, but I wasn't worried about wasting water. While I brushed my teeth and got ready, the U by Moen Smart Shower flushed the cold water from the pipes until it had reached my perfect temp. Then, it paused the water flow and sent a notification to my phone letting me know my shower was ready.

We have the U by Moen Smart Shower set up in a freshly renovated bathroom in the CNET Smart Home -- complete with one large main showerhead, a handheld showerhead, and four body sprays built into the wall. The temperature control is accurate and the app is intuitive and surprisingly useful. Especially for a guy accustomed to a simple setup in a bachelor pad, it's -- in a word -- luxurious.

The U by Moen Smart Shower fits that word well, actually. It's a luxury purchase through and through. The four outlet version we have at the smart home costs $2,200. The two outlet version (so for a shower head and a single other nozzle) costs $1,160. Neither price includes the shower heads themselves or the cost of installation -- just the control panel and a fancy valve. You can find plenty of nice shower heads with a faucet for $100 to $200. So if you're just interested in the smarts, wait for cheaper and easier-to-install alternatives. If you're in the market for a luxury remodel, the U by Moen makes sense -- it adds useful connected capabilities for around the price you'd pay for a non-connected control panel setup.

The two pieces you get when you purchase the smart shower -- the digital controller and the valve -- will theoretically work even on your existing showerhead. Moen's site calls the installation easy, but this is definitely not a snap-in-place smart gadget. It might technically be DIY, in the sense that building a house could be called DIY if you have the right know how, but most of us will want a plumber to do the work.

You can buy the U by Moen Smart Shower on Home Depot's website, build.com, efaucets.com and in wholesale bath and kitchen showrooms. You can preorder it now, and it ships starting March 1. Whether you preorder or wait, the price is the same: The four outlet version costs $2,200 and the two-outlet model costs $1,160. The Smart Shower is only available in the US and Canada for now.

Despite being admittedly much nicer than any shower I can remember using, a few things prevented my experience with the Moen Smart Shower from being perfect. I got into the U by Moen Smart Shower, hit a button to unpause it, then waited a few seconds. In the couple of minutes of downtime between when the shower paused and when I hopped in, the temp of the water in the pipes had lost 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit of heat.

That problem is accentuated if you switch to the body sprays -- watch out for an initial blast of cold water while Moen works the hot stuff to the front of those pipes as well. It's hard to feel like you're at a spa when you get a surprise blast of cold water in your face when you first turn on the handheld shower nozzle.

These hardware issues aren't Moen's fault -- it's designed to precisely control the water output temp, not heat your pipes -- but it's worth keeping in mind that the system isn't magic. If your house has low water pressure or a small hot water tank, this expensive smart shower system isn't going to fix those problems.

The valve -- called a digital thermostatic valve -- is the complicated and expensive piece. It mixes the hot and cold water precisely so you can set the water temp to a specific degree.

If you have plumbing experience and are thinking of doing this yourself, know that you'll need a sizable access panel by the thermostatic valve for maintenance, though you don't have to install it directly behind the shower. The included cord that runs to the control panel is long enough that you can install the panel up to 30 feet away.

The plumber who worked on the setup in the CNET Smart Home told me the process is much more complicated than simply installing an ordinary faucet, as you'd expect. Non-digital thermostatic valves are becoming more common in high-end houses -- not only do they allow precise temperature control, but they regulate the pressure. When I flushed the toilet right next to the shower, the temp didn't budge.

Digital thermostatic valves are still pretty rare -- you'll only find one or two at stores like Home Depot. Given the prices are comparably high for similar models from Kohler, Moen isn't charging a huge premium for its app connectivity. It's the digital thermostatic valve that makes this purchase a lofty one.

Essentially, you're buying professional quality lab equipment for your home -- the multi-thousand dollar intellifaucets we use for testing laundry machines and dishwashers calibrate the temp 60 times a second. Moen's valve impressively keeps up by calibrating 50 times a second. That's much more precision than you'd ever be able to feel while showering, but it's nice to know Moen didn't skimp on the quality of its equipment.

Once you do get everything installed, the control panel is simple to use -- complete with buttons to control the temp, activate presets, and turn the various nozzles on or off. I had no idea what my ideal shower temp was before using this smart shower, so the in-shower temp controls came in handy. I found my sweet spot at 105 degrees Fahrenheit, which then allowed me to build a detailed preset in the app.

With each preset, you can customize the temp, a greeting that will show up on the control panel, which nozzles you'd like active, and what happens when the shower is ready. With mine, I have the shower pause the water and send me a push notification. You can also set a timer for each preset. Once the timer runs out, you can have the shower alert you or even turn off completely.

These functions have implications beyond simply luxury. By warming up and pausing your shower, Moen helps you conserve water in the meantime. By shutting off the water after you've decided your teenage children have had enough time to get clean, you can help encourage them to take shorter showers. That said, there's nothing to stop your teen from just turning the water right back on once the timer expires.

The app allows you to customize two presets that you activate with the buttons on the shower's control panel. You can also build up to 10 other presets that you can activate from the app.

Weirdly, the app stumbles over the process if you don't close it out entirely between your showers. Repeatedly during testing, I'd hit the button to start my preset. The shower would turn on for a moment, then pause and tell me that my shower was ready, even though it had been hours since I'd used it and Moen hadn't cycled out the cold water.

Even when the preset works as intended, the shower only stays paused for five minutes. If you start your shower and forget about it, it won't try to keep the water warm by running briefly every now and then, it'll just cancel your shower. I appreciated that feature, as it might stop the shower from wasting lots of water if you forget about it for a day, but a keep-warm option might be nice if you're pulled away for 15 or 20 minutes.

Besides the presets, you can also control all of the basic shower functions via the app, so you're free to mess with your spouse by turning on body spray nozzles from afar while he or she tries to shower in peace.

In the future, Moen hopes to make the system even smarter, and a rep mentioned both Amazon's Alexa and Apple's HomeKit as possible integrations -- though she wouldn't confirm that the shower has the MFi chip HomeKit requires. I'd certainly like to be able to turn on my shower with a voice command to my Amazon Echo. She noted that nothing is official right now. She assured me, though, that Moen will send any updates over the air to existing smart showers. That's possible for Alexa, but not for HomeKit if it doesn't have that MFi chip. Moen will do its best to make sure your fancy purchase doesn't quickly become obsolete, but tread carefully if you're a HomeKit user.

The U by Moen Smart Shower charmed me without quite winning me over. Moen's app walks the line between tech and simplicity well. It adds genuinely useful connectivity to a device that we all know works fine without bells and whistles, but Moen kept the additions simple, intuitive and effective. If I could easily and cheaply add just its smarts to my existing shower setup, I'd do it without hesitation and recommend this system broadly.

Unfortunately, for those of us that just want connected convenience, the barrier to entry for this setup is too steep. This isn't a connected DIY gadget, it's an investment in a luxury shower setup. In that light, at $2,200 for the four-outlet version we tested, and $1,160 for a two-outlet smart shower, the U by Moen is actually reasonably priced. If you're remodeling and want a control panel in your new, fancy shower, the U by Moen provides convenient extras with its app for not much more than you'd pay for an ordinary control panel and precision valve. The app isn't perfect and the system isn't magic, but it adds enough innovation to the basics to be worth your consideration as a high-end upgrade."
Lux Geo thermostat review:|"

Lux's $149 Geo thermostat, available in the US only, has a flexible design you can mount either horizontally or vertically. You also have the choice of a white or a black finish and the related app makes it easy to set a heating and cooling schedule, as well as a geofencing radius for automatic home and away mode adjustments.

It performs well, and its unique convertible design gives it extra points, but the Geo's price doesn't quite match up with what it offers customers. In particular, Lux's smart thermostat has zero smart-home integrations, where competing models from Honeywell, Ecobee and Emerson all at least work with Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa. The Lux Geo is a decent choice, but not if you're in search of the best value.

Not only is the Lux Geo's horizontal/vertical mount appealing from a practical standpoint -- you may not have to drill new holes in your wall or cover previously hidden patches of last generation's paint color if you have two mounting options.

It also looks neat. No, it isn't exactly the modern touchscreen aesthetic we've seen lately from Honeywell, Nest and Ecobee, but its minimal digital display and dial controller keep things simple.

Curious about the Geo's specs and features? Take a peek at this comparison chart:

The Lux Geo falls in line with the Honeywell Lyric T5, the Ecobee3 Lite and the Emerson Sensi as a new, lower priced thermostat that's still high-end and mostly smart. No, you won't find any algorithmic learning or any smart-home integrations here (not yet, at least -- Lux says it has an Alexa skill coming ""around March 1""), but the Geo does come with a related Android or iPhone app and geofencing for a degree of home/away mode automation.

And, like the Nest Learning Thermostat ($247.99 at Amazon.com) and the Emerson Sensi, the Geo doesn't require a C-wire to operate. Not sure what that means? Check out this post for more details.

Installation took less than 10 minutes in my case, mainly because I didn't have to drill any new holes. When in doubt,  contact a professional to help with this step. Configuring the thermostat was also straightforward -- download the app, create an account, verify your email address, and follow the steps to connect your Geo to your Wi-Fi network.

Once it's online, the app will prompt you to name your thermostat and set a seven-day schedule by dragging the times to match up with your routine. After setting a schedule, the app will give you the option of creating a geofencing radius. This feature sets a distance threshold.

When your phone crosses it, your thermostat knows you're either home or away and will adjust the settings accordingly. Geofencing also overrides your fixed seven-day schedule in the event that you drop by your house when your schedule thinks you should be at work or vice versa.

The Lux Geo performed consistently well during testing. It stuck to the schedule I created unless the geofencing feature noticed an inconsistency. Then, it would make the needed adjustments and send me an alert -- ""Radius ended Away/Home mode."" You can also make any manual adjustments to the temperature or other setting using the app or the dial on the thermostat itself.

Still, I want Lux to update its app design to something a little more current, and I really wish it worked with at least one smart-home platform. The Honeywell Lyric T5 costs $150, offers scheduling and geofencing, and works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit. The two potentially important caveats are that Honeywell's Lyric T5 requires a C-wire, and it doesn't offer multiple mounting options.

The $169 Ecobee3 Lite has even more smart-home partners than the Lyric T5, but it doesn't support geofencing and you still need a C-wire to install it. Emerson's $160 Sensi works with Amazon Alexa and it doesn't require a C-wire, but it doesn't have a geofencing feature, either. You'll definitely need to think about the exact features you want from a smart thermostat before you buy, but most of the Geo's competitors are significantly smarter.

The $149 Lux Geo's geofencing feature and C-wire-optional installation give it definite appeal, but it's the flexible horizontal/vertical layout that truly differentiates it from other smart thermostats. The lack of smart-home partners is disappointing, particularly compared to the $169 Ecobee3 Lite's multitude of integrations, but that won't be a deal-breaker for everyone, especially since the Geo is available for 20 bucks less.

Even so, the Geo doesn't offer as many features as its competitors, and why should you pay roughly the same amount for a connected thermostat that does less? Short answer: you shouldn't -- unless you want the install versatility only the Geo can offer."
Yale Assure Keyless Bluetooth Smart Lock review:|"

""A lock without a key"" might sound like a lyric from a depressing piece of country music, but it's actually the pitch for the Yale Assure smart lock. For $200, it's a deadbolt that offers a touchpad for coded entry, a Bluetooth radio to pair with a companion app on your phone and, notably, absolutely no place to put a key.

Keyless locks like this one eliminate the threat of someone breaking in using a lockpick or a bump key, but they also remove a time-tested means of entry -- your key -- from the equation. With the Assure on your door, your only means of getting in are the touchpad and the companion app. And, given that you can get a keyless touchpad lock sans smarts  	 	for roughly half the price of this one, there's an awful lot of pressure on that app to make the Assure a worthwhile upgrade.

In the end, the Assure doesn't even come close. You can't use the app to lock the door from afar, and it won't even tell you if the door is locked in the first place. Aside from sharing access with others, all the app really offers is a way to pull out your phone and use it to unlock the door when you're already standing right in front of it. At that point, I don't know why you wouldn't just leave your phone in your pocket and punch in your code.

For an extra $50, you can upgrade the Assure with a  	 	Z-Wave or ZigBee radio module, or, starting in April, a $75 Apple HomeKit module that'll let you lock and unlock it using Siri voice commands. All of those will expand the Assure's smart features, but if that's the kind of thing that interests you, then you're better off just getting one of several other smart locks that include those sort of smarts from the get-go (and which don't ask you to pay extra for them). In general, almost all of those competing locks make more sense than the Assure does.

The Yale Assure smart lock looks like the gadget that it is, which might not be ideal if you're looking for something inconspicuous that won't advertise the fact that you have disposable income to spend on things like Bluetooth deadbolts.

Aside from adding in nodes on the bottom of the lock that'll let you power it with a 9V battery if the juice ever runs out, the Assure borrows  	 	the exact same build that we've seen from Yale's smart locks for years now. Either the team at Yale is extremely pleased with that design, or they haven't bothered to put any thought into refining it.

The latter would be a mistake given how competitive the smart lock category is getting. Just look at the Assure's closest rival,  	 	an upcoming keyless smart lock from Kwikset called the Obsidian. It features a modern, minimalist design and a slightly smaller interior footprint than the Assure, too. I know which one I'd rather bolt to my front door.

Installing the Assure is simple enough, requiring only a screwdriver, some measuring tape and about 20 minutes of your time. That said, as with all smart locks,  	 	you'll want to make sure that your door is properly aligned before buying one. If you need to push or pull on the doorknob in order to turn the lock smoothly, then that's something you'll need to fix. You'll also want to make sure that the hole in your doorframe is deep enough for the entire deadbolt.

As for your phone, you'll need an Android device running Android 4.1 or later, or an Apple device running at least iOS 9.

Once the lock is installed, you'll jump right into the app to pair it with your phone and start assigning codes and managing access. You can create up to 12 codes for multiple users, then track who's coming and going in the app's history section. If you want, you can set time-specific access for certain users -- a code that only works on a certain day at a certain time for your dog-sitter, for instance.

The app also lets you create and send out ""digital keys"" that let you unlock the door with a single tap. At least, sort of.

With the app installed and the digital key accepted, you'll need to pull out your phone and either rotate it 90 degrees or tap a button on the app's homescreen,   then tap the bottom left corner of the lock's touchpad. No, I don't know why you wouldn't just keep your phone in your pocket and use your code, either.

That ""Twist N' Go"" rotation mechanism for activating your digital key was a bit clunky when I tested it out. I wasn't always able to get it to work reliably, often needing to fling my phone into the landscape orientation two or three times before it'd activate.

By comparison, tapping the ""Activate Keys"" button on the app's homescreen worked like a charm -- but again, how is this any more convenient than using the touchpad like normal?

To make matters worse, you only get five of those digital keys. After that, each one costs you $1.99. It's not the biggest deal if you don't need to share access with a lot of people (and it's about what you'd pay to make a copy of a key at a hardware store), but I still think it's a mistakenly stingy strategy (and certainly stingier than the Kwikset Kevo, for which you only pay for scheduled keys, and August, which doesn't charge at all).

Bottom line: Expensive smart locks shouldn't charge their owners for the convenience of using them as intended.

The other big problem is that there's really nothing else that the app does aside from letting you manage access codes or use a digital key at your door. You can't see the current status of the lock, for instance, so if you're lying in bed and can't remember whether or not you locked the door, the app won't help you.

That leads us right to one last omission, and it's a biggie. The app won't let you lock or unlock the door from afar, even if you're within Bluetooth range. Like the finicky Twist N' Go feature, I'm sure that this is a result of Yale erring on the side of security rather than convenience, but it's still a bit of a head-scratcher given that remote locking and unlocking is pretty much a standard feature for connected deadbolts at this point.

All of what I've written here adds up to a $200 smart lock with underwhelming smarts -- and as a result, one that you probably won't use that much differently from a plain old dumb lock. You can pay an extra $50 for a Z-Wave or ZigBee module that'll let you connect the Assure lock with a smart home platform like Wink or SmartThings, or, starting in April, pay an extra $75 for a module that'll make the lock compatible with Apple HomeKit and let you control it using Siri commands -- but why not spend less on a smart lock that offers those integrations straight out of the box?

If that's what you're after, Yale's own Z-Wave and ZigBee ""Real Living"" touchscreen deadbolts will do the trick, and for HomeKit, you could go with the Kwikset Premis, the Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt or the August Smart Lock. If you want a convenience upgrade, the Kwikset Kevo's touch-to-unlock smarts put the Assure's Twist N' Go feature to complete shame. All of those competitors will cost less than the Assure plus a module, and all of them are better reviewed, too. I wouldn't pick the Assure over any of them."
IGuardStove Intelligent review:|"

Half of house fires in the US start because something goes awry during cooking. A Wi-Fi-enabled device wants to curb those accidents by managing the power that goes to your stove and keeping an eye on you while you cook.

The $495 iGuardStove Intelligent automatically shuts off your stove if you leave your cooking unattended thanks to a two-part system of a power box and motion detector. And the built-in Wi-Fi can help keep you posted online about how often the system has to shut down off your stove and send you alerts if it's happening a little too often.

The product has its shortcomings, including the absence of a mobile app (the company said it's on its way) and a cost that makes it out of reach for a lot of people. But it's useful if you need an extra set of eyes in the kitchen of someone who may forget that they're cooking.

The iGuardStove is a simple device that smartens up your electric range with little effort on your part. You plug the iGuardStove's power box into into your wall and plug your range into the power box. You connect the box to a control panel that has a built-in motion sensor and mount that panel beneath an upper kitchen cabinet next to your range (or in a place that's not directly over the stovetop).

If you've started to cook something on a burner or in the oven and step out of the motion detector's range for more than 5 minutes, the iGuardStove will put your range into standby mode so that your food stops cooking. The device will turn your range back on if you step back into the motion detector's view within 30 minutes -- if you take longer, you have to press the reset button on the iGuardStove's control panel.

You can adjust all of these settings in your online account or directly on the control panel (a tricky feat thanks to some pretty small fonts). There's also a manual mode you can enable on the control panel if you need to cook something for a longer period of time and don't want your oven to shut down. And the child lock mode will require you to press a button on the control panel before the iGuardStove lets your oven come on.

Here's where the Wi-Fi comes in: You connect the iGuardStove to your home's Wi-Fi network, and the device will begin to keep a digital record of how many times you've turned on the oven and how often the iGuardStove shut off your stove.

The iGuardStove also sends you email alerts if it's turned off your range five or more times in 24 hours (you'll also get an email if someone presses an emergency button on the control panel or if the iGuardStove loses connection). The emails, which came into my inbox almost immediately after numerous tests, could provide a caregiver with valuable information on how often a loved one in a different home forgets to turn off the stove.

The iGuardStove's makers have other models of the device, including a $395 Smart version without Wi-Fi and an Intelligent model for gas ranges. It will also work with Wi-Fi-enabled ovens that you can turn on remotely.

And it isn't just geared toward the easily distracted. Its manufacturers say the device would work well in homes of people with physical disabilities or aging adults who still live in their homes. The iGuardStove also sends email alerts if it has had to automatically shut off the stove five or more times in 24 hours. This is a good feature if you are worried about a loved one who doesn't live in the same home as you.

The iGuardStove delivers on its promise to stop cooking if you step away from your stove for too long. Once you turn on a burner or begin to preheat the oven, ""Protection Enabled"" pops up on the control panel's LCD display to let you know it's keeping an eye on you. The timer begins to count down after you leave the oven's range (which is about 10 feet).

If you leave the default shut-off setting at 5 minutes, the iGuardStove will begin to beep loudly to warn you that it will turn off your oven if you don't get back in range soon. Your range goes into a standby if you don't return -- technically, it's still on (for example, the convection fan in the oven on which I tested the iGuardStove kept operating), but all of the heating elements shut down until you return.

There are drawbacks to the iGuardStove. There isn't a mobile app for the product yet, which seems like a feature that would be a given on a Wi-Fi-enabled device. The company says it has an app coming for both iOS and Android later in 2017, but it's not live right now. A promised temperature detection feature that can sense both high and low temps also isn't live yet. And $495 is a lot of money -- you can find stoves that cost around that price.

The iGuardStove works well in sensing when you use your oven and when you walk away. It could give you some peace of mind if you can afford it. If not, keep an eye on products like the Inirv React, a less expensive but similar system that fits onto your burner knobs and detects smoke along with fire."
Ezviz Mini 360 Plus review:|"

When standard fixed-angle security cameras don't cover enough ground, pan/tilt models make smart alternatives -- they raise, lower and rotate to capture more of a room.

The $80 Ezviz Mini 360 Plus has a 340-degree panning angle and an 80-degree tilting angle that you can either adjust manually or set to ""auto-tracking"" mode to follow motion activity for you. It also works with  	 	IFTTT and comes with local as well as optional cloud storage for an additional fee. The Mini 360 Plus has limited availability in the UK and isn't currently sold in Australia; the price converts to roughly £65/AU$105 at the current exchange rate.

Unfortunately, the Mini 360 Plus wasn't particularly good at following motion activity -- one of its core features. I'd look instead to the $150  	 	Zmodo Pivot for a true 360 cam that tracks activity without stumbling.

Ezviz's Mini 360 Plus looks nice enough. It's a smallish adapter-dependent orb that you can install and connect anywhere in your home over Wi-Fi. It also comes with an Ethernet port if you want to tether it directly to your router. This model has a relatively narrow 92-degree diagonal field of view, but its 340-degree panning angle and 80-degree tilting angle allow you to see much more.

To get started, download the Ezviz app on your Android or iPhone gadget of choice, then follow the step-by-step tutorial to get the camera up and running. I already had an Ezviz account from testing out the $70 fixed-angle  	Ezviz Mini, but the configuration process took less than 10 minutes from start to finish.

The Ezviz app isn't as streamlined as I'd like. You really have to poke around to find the settings and other features you're searching for. It also looks dated and is in definite need of a design refresh.

This unfortunately extends to the app's overall usability, particularly when you're trying to manually pan or tilt the camera. Open the camera's live feed and select the arrow icon on the far left. From there, select the Pan/Tilt option.

This takes you to a seemingly blank half of the screen, but tap it and an arrow will appear. The odd thing is that you don't have a lot of control over which arrow appears first -- selecting the top of the screen, for instance, might engage the left arrow, sending the camera in the wrong direction.

The camera's rotations are also a little noisy -- not ideal for a discreet device like a security camera.

In addition to its pan and tilt functions, the Mini 360 Plus also offers:

I set up an IFTTT rule that connected the Ezviz camera to the   Ecobee3 thermostat installed at the CNET Smart Home -- whenever the Ezviz cam detected activity, the Ecobee3's settings changed. You can also connect smart lights and other compatible smart home devices to the Mini 360 Plus through IFTTT. Find out more here.

The Mini 360 Plus has solid HD live streaming in both day and night mode. I also had a couple of (mostly) clear conversations using the app's two-way talk function, but its motion detection and related auto-tracking features fell short.

I received consistent notifications whenever the camera detected movement. The problem is, it also detected activity when the only movement was a shadow shifting in the light. At first I thought this might be due to its motion sensitivity setting, but the camera's default setting sits right in the middle between no motion detection and very high detection sensitivity. At this setting, phantom alerts shouldn't be an issue.

Its auto-tracking feature was disappointing, too. When I walked slowly in front of the camera's field of view, it tracked me pretty well. But it struggled when I walked at a slightly faster pace, to the extent that it regularly gave up and stopped following me. Zmodo's Pivot does a much better job tracking activity, likely due to its 360 degrees of built-in motion sensors.

80 bucks is an excellent price for a home security camera, but that still isn't enough to recommend the Ezviz Mini 360 Plus. Yes, it's a fine live streaming device, but its core function -- 360-degree panning -- has serious limitations. I'd opt for   Ezviz's less expensive Mini cam instead if you simply want an affordable live streaming camera. And I'd take a close look at the Zmodo Pivot if you're looking for a reliable 360-degree-tracking camera.

Let Brilliant's ambitious light switch take charge of your smart home|"

The $200 Brilliant Control isn't the first product to focus your smart home control on a touchscreen light switch.

Like the Wink Relay, the Brilliant Control combines the functions of a basic switch with a touchscreen that allows you to do a lot more than control the lights.

The Brilliant responds to touch, like the Relay. It also adds motion and voice controls with Alexa built in. Like the $180 Amazon Echo, Alexa's primary device, Brilliant's goal appears to be making it easier for the whole family to control the smart home. Instead of relying on the apps on an individual's phone, anyone in the house will have equal access to the devices connected to the Brilliant switch.

Created by California-based tech startup Brilliant, the Brilliant Control has a 5-inch LCD touchscreen that can display art or family photos when it's not in use. It connects to your home's Wi-Fi network and also works with Bluetooth.

The Brilliant Control will fit panels with up to four light switches, although you'll need to pay more to cover bigger panels. It'll let you turn the lights on or off and dim them as well. Brilliant also goes beyond competitors like Belkin and Lutron by adding the option to control a lot of other smart home gear. At launch, Brilliant will work with an impressive variety of platforms:

You can scroll up and down on the panel to adjust your Nest Learning Thermostat's temperature, or use Ring with Brilliant's built-in camera and microphone to talk with the delivery person at your door. And if you install more than one Brilliant panel, you can use them as intercoms.

Brilliant has an impressive list of features, but we had problems controlling the similar $90 Wink Relay when it came out a couple of years ago. And if you don't have a lot of smart home gear, Lutron switches will add smarts to your fixtures for less -- $190 nets you a starter kit with two switches -- while still working with Alexa and Apple's Homekit.

The Brilliant Control starts at $200, which is a little pricey given that Wink's competitive product is now on sale for $70 on Amazon. Combine that with Amazon's mini Echo -- the $50 Echo Dot -- for voice commands, and you still won't reach Brilliant's off-the-shelf price. But you can preorder the Brilliant Control now for a more tempting special price of $150.

Brilliant expects to start shipping this summer. Right now, you can only order the panel in the US, though Brilliant plans to expand to the rest of the world in the future. The US price converts to roughly £160 or AU$260.

If Brilliant wants to beat the current DIY offerings, the Brilliant Control will need a polished interface and snappy controls. The company's positioning itself as an easier and more affordable route to professional systems such as Control4 and Crestron -- but those companies offer contract-based support and do all the installation work for you. Brilliant isn't quite the same.

Brilliant's Alexa integration is a nice touch, as are its many other smart home integrations. But since it's aiming to centralize the smart home, the Brilliant Control has a steep hill to climb if it wants to beat the Amazon Echo at its own game with its own assistant.

Philips SceneSwitch 60W Equivalent LED review:|"

When I review a product, I typically enjoy the challenge of combing through the nuance of its strengths and weaknesses to come up with a concrete buying recommendation. Unfortunately, there is no such nuance to comb with the Philips SceneSwitch LED, because it is, quite simply, a very, very good light bulb.

Let's make this easy with some bullet points, shall we?

The only real problem with these bulbs is that you can't use them with conventional dimmer switches -- but that's sort of the point. The SceneSwitch feature lets you dial the light down without need for any extra dimming hardware. Unlike normal three-way LEDs, the SceneSwitch bulbs will change settings with any lamp or fixture, and they cost less than most of those standard three-way LEDs, too. No nuance necessary -- these are some of the best non-dimmable light bulbs money can buy, period.

""SceneSwitch"" is a pretty killer feature for these otherwise basic bulbs. Each one comes with three distinct settings, and you can switch between them simply by turning the bulb off and back on again (they'll stay on your selected setting if the bulb is off for more than 5 seconds or so). It's similar to what you'll get from a common three-way bulb, except you don't need a three-way lamp in order to use them. Any old lamp or light switch will do.

The other distinction between the two is that common three-way bulbs tend to offer 100W, 60W, and 40W brightness settings, while the SceneSwitch LEDs offer the rough equivalent of 60W, 40W, and nightlight settings. For me, being able to dial a bulb all the way down to minimum brightness is about as appealing as being able to crank it up to the 100W level, so this seems like a pretty even trade-off.

You get three options with the SceneSwitch LED. First is a yellowy, soft white bulb that offers those three brightness settings for about $8. Second is a bluish-white, daylight version with the same brightness settings for about $9. Last is a combo bulb that offers a 60W equivalent soft white setting, a 60W equivalent daylight setting, and the soft white nightlight setting. It also costs $9. It's worth noting that all three are less expensive than the typical three-way LED, most of which sell for at least $12.

The obvious appeal here is for lamps and fixtures that can't dim down on their own. With the SceneSwitch LED, you've got an easy, affordable option that'll let you enjoy dimmed-down light wherever you like without need for any extra dimming hardware or smarts. The combo bulb has some extra appeal in that you can switch it from an energizing daylight tone during the day to a relaxing soft white glow in the evening.

All three versions of the bulb offer multiple brightness settings that you can switch between by turning the bulb off and back on -- like a three-way bulb you can use anywhere. All three are even brighter than stated at their brightest settings. All three did an excellent job managing heat build-up, which can affect light output in some bulbs. All three come with a 5-year warranty (and, as of right now, you can double that to 10 years by registering the bulb online within 60 days of purchase). All three cost less than $9, which means that each one will pay for itself in energy savings in just over a year if you're upgrading from an incandescent.

The SceneSwitch LEDs have more than a nifty feature going for them. They're also very decent light bulbs in their own right.

Let's start with brightness. All three SceneSwitch LEDs claim to put out 800 lumens at their brightest setting, a number that would put them right on par with a 60W incandescent. In my tests, all three bulbs exceeded that number, meaning that they're putting out plenty of light.

And, as you'd expect from an LED, each one is efficient, too. At 9 watts from the soft white and daylight SceneSwitch bulbs and 9.5 watts from the combo bulb, each one is using just a fraction of the energy that a 60W incandescent would use. Swap a SceneSwitch bulb in for an incandescent like that, and you'll knock an average of about 6 bucks off your yearly energy bill. At that rate, the SceneSwitch LED would pay for itself in a little over a year, then continue saving you money for years.

How many years? Almost 14, per the stated lifespan. Philips backs that claim up with a five-year warranty for each SceneSwitch LED. Register your purchase online within 60 days, and they'll double the coverage term to 10 years. That's a good deal.

I was also impressed with how well each SceneSwitch LED managed heat build up. Just like your phone, your laptop, or most other electronics, LED performance will decline as things get hot. That's why LEDs typically include heat sinks, convection vents, or some other means of keeping heat at bay. With the SceneSwitch bulbs, those heat sinks did a fantastic job.

Most LEDs typically lose a little bit of their initial brightness in the first hour or so as the bulb heats up. Then, the brightness levels off as the heat sink kicks in. The average LED will lose about 15 percent of its initial brightness due to heat build-up, but the SceneSwitch LEDs all did better. The combo bulb lost 11.5 percent, the daylight bulb lost 9.5 percent, and the soft white bulb? Just a  5 percent dip -- one of the best results I've seen from any LED I've ever tested. That makes these bulbs a good pick for enclosed fixtures, where heat gets trapped.

The one spot where SceneSwitch bulbs are just so-so is color quality. To my eye, all three options were on par with the average LED, which is to say that things look fine, but a little yellowy. For something that does a better job of making the colors in your home pop, you might consider something like  the GE Reveal LED, which filters out that excess yellow light -- but keep in mind that bulbs like that often won't be quite as bright as you'd like.

Among non-dimmable LED bulbs, the Philips SceneSwitch LEDs have a secret weapon that can't be beat: they dim. There's nothing else below 10 bucks that'll let you dial the lights down without dimming hardware, and on top of that, they're just darned good bulbs in their own right. They're an easy Editors' Choice-winner in my eye.

If you don't care about that SceneSwitch feature (or about dimmability in general), then you can save a couple of bucks by going with a standard non-dimmable option like the GE Bright Stik LED or Philips' own non-dimmable 60W equivalent. And, if you're looking for a bulb you can use with a dimmer switch, then you'll want to go with one of our top dimmable LED picks. But for everyone else, the SceneSwitch LEDs are definitely worth some strong consideration in your local lighting aisle."
GE 60W Equivalent HD Light LED review:|"

I imagine that a lot of shoppers will be asking themselves what the heck ""HD Light"" is the next time they stroll through the lighting aisle -- and for that, we have GE to thank. That's because ""HD Light"" is the new branding you'll find on the venerable manufacturer's latest LED lineup, which includes bulbs of all kinds of shapes, sizes, wattages and color temperatures.

To be clear, there is no such thing as ""HD Light,"" but the idea that GE wants to convey here is superior light quality. And to be fair, some of these bulbs -- most notably the ""Reveal"" LEDs, with their high color rendering scores -- offer light quality that's noticeably better than average. But none of them are perfect, and most fall closer to mediocre in terms of brightness and dimming performance.

Still, with all-around acceptable specs and with prices on regular, A-shaped bulbs starting at $8 for a two-pack, GE's lineup of HD Light LEDs are a decent enough value to warrant consideration, especially given what they can do for the color quality in your home.

GE offers three standard 60-watt replacement options in the HD Light lineup. The first is the ""Relax"" LED, which casts a warm, candle-like glow designed to help you wind down in the evening. The second is the ""Refresh"" LED, a daylight-tinted bulb intended to help you feel more focused and energetic during the day. Last up is the ""Reveal"" LED, which sticks to years of GE Reveal branding to promise better color quality in rooms where it might matter -- the kitchen, perhaps, or maybe a living room with a lot of colorful decor.

There's nothing inherently unique about any of them -- no smarts, no gimmicky lighting tricks and no unusual designs. These are pretty plain old light bulbs, save for the fact that they're high-efficiency LEDs.

So how efficient are we talking? Each bulb draws 10.5 watts, or 17.5 percent of what a standard 60-watt incandescent would use. That incandescent will add about $7.20 per year to your energy bill if you use it for an average of three hours per day. By the same metrics, any of these three GE HD Light LEDs will add roughly $1.26 to that annual figure.

That's a savings of $5.94 per year, per bulb, meaning that each one will easily pay for itself within 12 months, then continue saving you money for years on out. Unlike incandescents, which will burn out after about a year of use, these HD Light LEDs promise an expected lifespan of 13.7 years, and come backed by a five-year warranty. Replace that incandescent and use GE's LED for its entire lifespan, and you're looking at a total energy savings of $81.38 -- and that's just for one bulb.

Still, those savings aren't unique to GE, or to any other LED manufacturer. LEDs are just inherently more efficient than any other readily available lighting option. All of them will save you money if you're upgrading from incandescent bulbs (or even fluorescent ones, for that matter). To judge an LED's real value against its competitors, you have to factor performance in, as well.

GE's on somewhat shakier ground, here. Let's start with brightness. Though they all came in well within the margin of error, none of the bulbs tested quite as bright as their stated lumen counts. This isn't much of a problem for the ""Relax"" and ""Refresh"" LEDs, both of which finished close enough to 800 lumens to qualify as perfectly decent 60-watt replacement bulbs. But look at the lumen count for that ""Reveal"" LED -- just 554. The box brands the LED as a 60-watt replacement, but the light it puts out is closer to the 450 lumens you'd expect from a 40-watt bulb. That's a recipe for disappointment.

The reason the thing is so dim is because the plastic bulb includes a special filter that blocks some of the light from the yellow part of the visible light spectrum. You can see that blocked light in the form of that W-shaped dip in the graph on the right above. Blocking those bits of the middle of the spectrum keeps the dominant yellow tones from overpowering things, and does, in fact, help the bulb make the colors in your home look richer and more authentic -- but it also means that the bulb is putting out less light.

The simple fix would have been to bump the wattage up a little bit to help make up for the lost light, but GE didn't do that here. That's fine -- but continuing to call the Reveal LED a 60-watt replacement is not. GE's engineers tell me that they plan on addressing this shortcoming with the next generation of Reveal bulbs, which they claim will offer a higher lumen count than this version while drawing less energy. To me, that sounds like a bulb worth waiting for.

Still, the current-gen Reveal LED was, as expected, very good at rendering vivid, accurate colors in my tests, along with very clean shades of white free from the dingy yellow tints that you'll get with most soft white bulbs. These are subtle things, to be sure, but to some, they matter quite a bit. If that includes you, then the Reveal LED deserves a look.

And, though they weren't quite the color rendering standouts that the Reveal LED was, the Relax and Refresh LEDs still did surprisingly well in my tests, too. Despite the extra hit of yellow light, they both rendered colors that, to my eye, looked at least a little bit better than what you'll get from the average LED. Point GE.

The last thing I look for in my tests is dimmer compatibility. All three of these bulbs are dimmable, but none of them dimmed down any lower than 10 percent on any of the switches I tested them on. I also caught all three of them flickering a bit more than the average LED when I filmed them in slow motion. That sort of flicker is too fast to be noticed by the naked eye, but some people are more sensitive to strobing than others, so it's something worth being aware of.

I give these bulbs a passing grade, but not a full-throated recommendation. All three offer energy savings and noticeably good color quality, but they also come with dimming performance that's mediocre at best. The Reveal LED might be the most appealing of the three thanks to the way it filters out excess yellow light for cleaner-looking whites and richer colors, but at just 554 lumens, it isn't bright enough to justify calling itself a 60-watt replacement.

Still, with prices starting at $8 for a two-pack of Relax LEDs, there's some good value to be had here. If you aren't using dimmer switches, and if you don't mind the brightness hit that comes with the Reveal LED, they're a perfectly fine choice for basic household use."
Hate being cold? This smart bed brings the heat|"

If you and your partner disagree on the ""right"" sleep temperature, startup WinkBeds might have a solution. Its new CoolControl mattress and base, now available in the US at WinkBeds.com, comes with dual temperature zones. Prices for the set start at $2,500 for a twin XL and go up to $4,300 for a California king.

CoolControl isn't currently sold internationally, but the California king's price converts to roughly £3,415 or AU$5,675 at the current exchange rate.

Similar to Sleep Number's 360 Bed, CoolControl comes with a related Android and iPhone app for making manual adjustments or programming it to auto-adjust the temp for you.

According to WinkBeds, CoolControl's radiant heat tech was developed with Gentherm, a company that manufactures seat warmers and coolers for cars. Apparently, you'll be able to separately adjust each side to 30 degrees above and 15 degrees below the ambient temperature in the bedroom.

So, if your partner (ahem) covertly turns the heat down into the 60s, you can still warm up your side of the bed with CoolControl. This could end up being a smart energy saver over time, too, since WinkBeds claims its plug-in system uses ""less electricity than a table lamp.""

The main downside is that there's nothing else smart about CoolControl. It doesn't integrate with any products from other smart home manufacturers. There's no voice control component -- ""Alexa, set my side of the bed to 72 degrees!"" -- or any other integration with connected platforms.

Even so, WinkBeds' CoolControl is at the forefront of a growing trend in sleep tech -- advanced temperature control. And I'm interested to see if this sort of feature continues to show up in other smart beds. So far, Sleep Number's new 360 Bed is among its closest competitors, but its dual-sided temperature control is limited to heating the foot of the bed only."
TP-Link LB130 Multicolor Wi-Fi LED review:|"

There's a growing list of lights that you can control by talking to Amazon's Alexa, the virtual AI assistant housed within the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers. Among them are a couple of devices from TP-Link, which has emerged as a decent budget option for Alexa-compatible gadgets.

Those options include the TP-Link LB130, a color-changing Wi-Fi bulb that costs $50. It's less of a bargain than TP-Link's  	smart plugs and non-color-changing smart bulbs, but it's still priced 10 bucks below what you'd spend on the comparable Lifx LED, a color-changing Wi-Fi bulb that also works with Alexa.

Like Lifx, the TP-Link LB130 is a bright, efficient bulb that offers full color and color temperature control through a companion app for Android and iOS devices. And, also like Lifx, you don't need a hub because it uses its own built-in Wi-Fi radio to connect directly with your home's router.

But the LB130 is not as well-featured or well-connected to third parties as Lifx and Philips Hue are. And, unlike Lifx, which offers its own custom Alexa skill, you can't ask Alexa to change the LB130's color, nor can you trigger color changes using outside services like IFTTT. There are just a few too many compromises here for me to recommend it over Lifx or Hue, even if it costs a little less.

The nice thing about smart bulbs like the LB130 that use Wi-Fi as opposed to something like ZigBee is that you don't need to plug any sort of hub into your router in order to translate their signal. You just screw the thing in, turn it on, and pair with it in TP-Link's ""Kasa"" app.

To do so, you'll follow the app's instructions and connect with the Wi-Fi signal that the bulb puts out when you first turn it on.  Then, you'll jump back into the app, where TP-Link will tether the bulb back to your home network. From there, you'll be able to turn the bulb on and off, dim it up and down, or change its color and color temperature using the app's controls.

If you want to pair it up with Alexa, just open the smart home section of the Alexa app, tap ""Get More Smart Home Skills"" and search for the Kasa skill. When you enable it, it'll ask you to provide your login info -- once you do, you'll be able to ask Alexa to scan for the bulb and add it to the list of devices she can control.

From there, Alexa can turn the bulb on and off or dim it up and down. You can also group it with other Alexa-compatible lights to control everything at once.

You can't, however, ask Alexa to change the color. For that, you'll need to use the app, which is a significant disappointment. After all, you aren't buying this bulb if color control isn't at least somewhat important to you, not when the non-color-changing version costs 30 bucks less. And it's not like Alexa-enabled color changes are impossible -- Lifx made it happen using a custom Alexa skill that lets her switch to any shade you like, provided you tack ""tell Lifx"" onto the start of your command.

So, the TP-Link LB130 is an Alexa-compatible color-changing bulb that won't let Alexa change the colors -- and that's not the only instance where the features come up short.

On paper, there's plenty of utility packed into that app, with scheduling, energy tracking, and even a ""Circadian Mode"" that'll automatically adjust the bulb's brightness and color temperature throughout the day. But it feels like TP-Link was more concerned with checking features off of a list than with actually executing them well.

Let's start with the scheduling tool. It works well enough, letting you program the bulb to turn on or off or change colors at specific times of day, but there's no option for selecting a custom fade duration like you'll get with Lifx. That might sound like a little thing, but slow fades are the key to simulating a sunrise to wake you up in the morning, or creating subtle visual reminders that a deadline is drawing near. You can't do anything like that with this bulb.

On the energy tracking front, the app will let you keep tabs on how much you're using each bulb on a per-day average, along with the average energy savings over a standard 60W incandescent. I suppose that's all well and good, but I'd have preferred a more graphical interface here instead of just a bunch of numbers. At the very least, the app could have translated the kilowatt-hours (kWh) saved into actual dollars and cents. It didn't do any of that, though. As a result, the feature feels arbitrary and tacked-on.

As for the Circadian Mode, it's a very simple way to automate the bulb to switch between hot, bluish-white daylight tones during the day and warmer, more candle-like yellows in the evening. There's no way to customize it, though, and that's a problem since the whole point of circadian lighting is to help you sleep better at night and feel more energized during the day. At a minimum, you really ought to be able to tell the bulb when you typically wake up and go to bed to better tailor those automated changes to your normal routine.

Most damning of all is the bulb's lack of connections outside of Alexa. There's no IFTTT channel, no compatibility with Apple HomeKit or Google Home, and no direct support for third-party controllers like SmartThings or Wink. Without those kinds of integrations, it's a lot tougher to put those colors to good use in your home.

Underwhelming features aside, the LB130 did impress me when I tested it in our lighting lab. The bulb calls itself a 60W replacement and claims a maximum brightness of 800 lumens, but it scored significantly higher, with the default setting clocking in at 896 lumens at full brightness.

The colors came in nice and bright, too, besting Philips Hue's newest bulbs at almost every turn and even keeping up with the category-leading Lifx LED. Color accuracy was strong for the most part, too, though the green and cyan tones weren't as richly saturated as I'd have liked.

In terms of efficiency, the bulb draws 11 watts at peak brightness, which makes it good for a little more than 80 lumens per watt. That's a better-than-average result, and perhaps a means of justifying the bulb's expense. Use it to replace a standard 60W incandescent and you'll knock about $6 per year off of your energy bill, assuming you're running it at full brightness for an average of three hours per day. Those energy savings will cover the cost of the bulb outright after eight and a half years, which is less than half of the bulb's stated lifespan.

Nah. At $50, the TP-Link LB130 doesn't do anything to change the fact that color-changing smart bulbs are still annoyingly expensive. And though it costs $10 less than the comparable third-gen Lifx LED, it comes with too many compromises to earn my recommendation. If I'm splurging, I'd rather spend the extra $10 and get better features, better Alexa controls and a better slate of smart home partners."
LG Smart Security review:|"

The once intense division between professional security firms like ADT and standalone DIY products is gone, and LG's Smart Security ($149.00 at Amazon.com) Wireless Camera is proof. LG's Smart Security is a $200 all-in-one security system with 1080p live streaming, an Alexa Skill, its own Z-Wave hub and optional ADT services.

If you're a renter who wants ADT's professional monitoring without being locked in to a contract, LG's Smart Security Wireless Camera is a reasonable choice. If access to ADT isn't a priority for you, Piper's $280 all-in-one NV system is a better bet. The NV has a wider field of view, a simpler app interface and, best of all, free video clip storage.

In the past, you had to pick between a professional firm or a DIY security setup for your home. There was absolutely no overlap between the two sides, and it fostered a lot of industry competition and innovation. Slowly, we began to see professional firms began to work with and offer accessories from other manufacturers, like when ADT integrated with Nest or Vivint partnered with Yale locks and Amazon Alexa. Select DIY systems like Scout and SimpliSafe began to offer their own professional monitoring services, too. You could install the systems yourself (if you wanted to), but you could also opt into advanced services for an added fee on a contract-free subscription plan.

But ADT's Canopy service is an entirely new service. Canopy is an app, an API and a contract-free subscription service that bridges the gap between security firms and DIY products like never before. LG's Smart Security Wireless Camera is the first all-in-one security system to offer such an integration and it marks an important shift in the market. That doesn't mean it's right for everyone, though.

Take a look at the LG Smart Security devices versus its competition:

The ADT integration really is the main thing that sets LG's Smart Security apart from either the Piper NV or Canary. Otherwise, it has a smaller field of view, no free cloud storage option, a unique but somewhat odd-looking design, and a comparatively clunkier app interface.

On the app front, the initial configuration is about what you'd expect: Create an account, verify your email address, plug in the device (the app recognizes it over Bluetooth), enter your Wi-Fi details and wait a few moments for it to connect. It should take less than 10 minutes.

Like the Piper NV, the LG Smart Security has temperature and humidity sensors in addition to a standard motion sensor.

The live feed looks comparable to Piper and Canary's 1080p HD, and the app's activity log updates every time the motion sensor detects activity (it knows the difference between general motion activity and someone picking up or ""tampering"" with the camera). It also updates if the temperature or humidity changes. Motion and tamper detection were all extremely responsive, too.

There's one thing that's kind of wonky about this app, though. You have to manually create the alerts you want to receive. This happens in the app's ""Activities"" tab. Click the plus sign in the top right corner to name your new activity and create a custom rule. This is great when you've added Z-Wave devices to the system and you want your camera to record a video clip.

For example, I paired the Aeon Labs Aeotec Water Sensor using the Z-Wave ""Pair Device"" section in the app and created an Activity that would send me an alert if the Aeotec detects water. I also created an Activity so I could say, ""Alexa, record a video clip"" any time I wanted a video clip on demand. It successfully recorded a clip and sent me an alert every time I ran the sensor under water.

But manually creating alerts doesn't make sense for motion. Motion detection and motion-related notifications are standard issue for pretty much every DIY camera I've ever tested. Having to build that alert yourself is counterintuitive to the extent that I thought the app was malfunctioning. ADT Canopy will send you motion alerts; you just have to build the rule first.

There's also a ""Devices"" tab in the app that's a little clunky. Here's where Z-Wave devices you've paired with the app show up, such as the Aeotec flood sensor. It lets you assign products to specific rooms, so the flood sensor is connected to the Kitchen, whereas lights could be added to the Basement, Kid's Bedroom, or anywhere you want.

But this page also automatically lists the LG Smart Security's camera, motion, temperature and humidity sensors as individual devices. Since the camera and all of the sensors are part of a single device, it feels a little odd/unnecessary to list them as devices here, especially since they can't exist in separate rooms.

Since LG's $200 Smart Security Wireless Camera doesn't offer free cloud storage, you'll have to pay at least $10 per month for ADT's 7-day event-based Canopy video clip storage. The monthly fee increases from there if you want 30-day clip storage and/or professional monitoring. If that's what you want, LG's Smart Security is a fine choice.

But Piper and Canary offer free event-based cloud storage, comparable specs and better mobile apps. The $280 Piper NV also performs extremely well, has a wider 180-degree field of view and, like LG's Smart Security, comes with its own Z-Wave hub. Strongly consider the NV if you aren't sold on LG's Smart Security Wireless Camera."
Teforia Infuser review:|"

Even if you're a tea fanatic, it's hard to justify the outrageous price tag of the almost $1,500 Teforia Infuser. Sure, the machine packs plenty of high-tech capabilities and hardware including both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth plus a mobile companion app. The Teforia is completely automated, and even scans RFID tags on its tea packs for precise brewing directions.

Still, while this opulent kitchen appliance does consistently create good cups of tea, simpler gadgets handle the job just as well and with more finesse and flexibility. Worse, they cost a fraction of the price, with even the premium $219 Breville One-Touch Tea Maker and Espro P5 ($78 with tea filter) coming in far below the Teforia's monumental expense. All that adds up to a foolhardy proposition, and one you should pass up unless you get money for nothing or grow it on trees.

I can't deny it, the Teforia Infuser is a pretty appliance. Measuring 13 inches tall by 8.3 inches wide and reaching back 12.3 inches deep, the machine is about the size of your average coffee maker. Its shape is blocklike as well, but that's where the resemblance ends. On the Teforia's face is a sphere, clear save for white sections on its top and bottom, that serves as a steeping chamber for tea leaves.

The small sphere, called ""the infusion globe,"" is held in place by two arms -- one above and one below. Under the lower arm sits a slim carafe for collecting brewed tea. The majority of its body is transparent, too, and the carafe's mouth slides neatly into a slot within this arm. There it hangs suspended in air above the bottom of the machine.

I do like this visual effect, and with a chassis constructed of smooth, white plastic and sculpted in gentle curves, the Infuser is attractive enough. The surfaces of the gadget are also easy to clean, especially with the included black microfiber cloth.

But still -- plastic? If I were unaware of the Teforia's atmospheric price I would never guess the appliance was so expensive. For instance, the Ratio Eight luxury coffee makers ($495 to $595) look and feel a great deal more impressive. They're also hand-built in Portland, Oregon, using posh materials such as wood, nickel and steel. Even the steel and glass frame of the $250 Breville One-Touch is more alluring. Sorry, but at this price, plastic doesn't cut it.

Brewing tea with the Teforia Infuser is an odd experience. First of all, the machine has no physical buttons or controls of any kind, and no screen for displaying info. Instead, cryptic symbols appear on the front face of the Infuser to indicate its status, such as a bubbling globe icon when it's brewing and a carafe when your tea is ready.

These symbols are formed by light shining through the Teforia's smooth plastic surface. As a result they appear faint and a bit blurry, unlike the clarity of traditional LED lights and LCD screens.

Before you make tea, you'll first fill the water tank (68 to 70 ounces) in the back of the appliance. It's sturdy and has a metal handle for easy transport. The reservoir is equipped with a water filter, but not a maximum fill line, strangely enough.

To use one of the Teforia SIPS (Selective Infusion Profile System) tea packs, just tap its paper label against the RFID reader on the top of the machine. This action theoretically tells the Infuser details about the tea it's about to brew and how to brew it. Next, peel off the pack label, pour its contents into the globe and confirm that the globe and carafe are locked in place. Lastly, hit the circular light on the Teforia's base to begin tea infusion.

You can also use the infuser to brew tea that isn't in SIPS packs, though you need to use the mobile app to do so (it's available on iOS and soon for Android). The app asks about the tea you'd like to prepare and sets up a custom brewing profile.

Teforia claims its Infuser makes tea using proprietary recipes that were ""crafted with tea masters and artisans"" and take ""dozens of variables"" into account, including infusion temperature. In the lab, however, we didn't see much difference in the Infuser's brewing from cup to cup.

Whether I told the Infuser to infuse black tea from a Teforia-branded Earl Grey pack, my own storebought leaves or a Teforia ""Hibiscus Song"" herbal blend, water inside the infusion globe never exceeded 186.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Brewing times were very similar too, though I did observe a range between 5 minutes (thin-cut black tea) and 6 minutes and 17 seconds (rolled pearl black tea leaves).

The infusion process is fun to watch, though. Hot water drips over the tea leaves to fill the globe halfway. Next the machine pumps air into the mixture, which agitates it. Finally, water flows into the globe to fill it completely.

After steeping for a moment, brewed tea is strained through a mesh filter inside the globe and falls into the waiting carafe. Within each brewing cycle this process is repeated three times, by the end of which the carafe should be full with about 12 ounces of liquid. Teforia calls these short steeping events ""micro infusions.""

Teforia further explained that these micro infusions are designed to unlock the pleasant flavor compounds inside tea leaves, plus caffeine, and leave the stringent tannins behind. The company also confirmed that the Infuser doesn't brew at the high temperatures traditional methods call for since it isn't necessary.

The tea I sampled from the appliance was good, though it didn't bowl me over with intense flavor. In fact, my favorite black tea blend, Royal Breakfast from Louisville Tea Company, tasted better brewed in the $78 Espro Press P5 than in the Teforia Infuser.

According to Teforia, I'd need to run something truly exceptional through the Infuser in order to really appreciate it -- something rare, handmade and close to $100 per pound. I'm no business mogul and don't have that sort of tea on hand (but then, neither am I the target buyer for a $1,500 teapot). Still, I can confirm that the Teforia Infuser brought out a little better flavor than usual from my $6-per-pound Tetley loose-leaf black tea.

Absolutely not. There are appliances that brew the sort of tea I prefer to drink with the same results. The $78 Espro P5 with tea filter and $219 Breville One-Touch Tea Maker spring to mind, both of which create cups of tea with adequate quality for my tastes.

Even if spending $1,499 is as painless for you as purchasing a pack of bubble gum, investing in a Teforia Infuser isn't the best use of your money. Instead, I suggest learning how to brew artisan tea by hand. Think of all that fancy tea you could get using the money you'll save."
Canary Flex review:|"

Canary's $199/£159 Flex definitely lives up to its name. Not only is this rechargeable, battery-powered indoor/outdoor security camera portable, its strong magnetic base and swiveling body design make it extremely easy to find the right viewing angle. The app is smartly designed, too, with an activity log of motion-related video clips and auto-adjusting Home and Away security modes tied to your phone's location.

You are limited to 720p video for live streaming, and the Flex currently only works with Wink on the smart home compatibility side of things. But Canary says it's working on an IFTTT channel and, in future hardware, integrations with HomeKit, Apple's Siri-based smart home platform.

Factor in the Flex's many optional accessories, including a Verizon 4G LTE mount, and there are few standalone DIY security cameras that offer so many potential use cases. Look no further than the Canary Flex ($151.99 at Amazon.com) for an HD live streaming device that's truly flexible.

The Flex is Canary's second security camera, following a successful Indiegogo campaign for its inaugural all-in-one indoor security system back in 2013. But the home security market has changed quite a bit since then. Yes, indoor high-definition live streaming cameras are still important, but many companies are introducing models that can go from your living room to your backyard with minimal effort. Enter: the Canary Flex.

Take a look at what the Flex can do versus the $200/£159 Logi Circle and the $250/£300 Netgear Arlo Pro:

Given that the Logi Circle is indoor-only, has a short battery life and doesn't work with any smart home products from other manufacturers, it really can't compete with Canary's Flex or Netgear's Arlo Pro ($221.44 at Amazon.com). But, the competition gets a lot closer when you look at the Flex and the Arlo Pro.

The Arlo Pro promises a longer battery life of ""up to six months"" compared with the Flex's two-month charge (Logi's lasted about four hours). After about a week of testing, the Netgear Arlo Pro's battery indicator still shows a full charge, while the Canary Flex is showing a slightly diminished battery around the 80 to 90 percent mark.

Netgear's rechargeable indoor/outdoor camera also has a wider viewing angle and offers seven days of free cloud storage (as opposed to the Flex's 24 hours). You'll also get a web app with Netgear's camera, as well as integrations with IFTTT and Samsung SmartThings. The Flex's third-party integrations currently include Wink, although the team is working on potential IFTTT and Apple HomeKit support.

Ultimately, I prefer the Flex's app interface and its fast hub-free setup -- the Arlo Pro requires the installation of a rather large hub that you connect to your router during initial configuration. The hub does have a built-in 100-decibel siren, but that might not make a difference if your router is located in your basement or some other out-of-the-way location in your house.

Netgear sells its Arlo Pro cameras in one or multiunit kits with the hub (since this is a required accessory). The one camera kit costs $250 -- 50 bucks more than a standalone Canary Flex or Logi Circle.

This is also where you can check the quality of your Wi-Fi connection and view the status of your rechargeable battery. You can also sign up to receive notifications when your battery is getting low, as well as when it's fully charged.

Select ""View Timeline"" on the bottom of the same page to pull up a time stamped list with video clips of any activity detected by the Flex's built-in sensors.

All of this worked very well, with only slight lag times and the occasional grainy image, likely due to a temporarily spotty Wi-Fi connection.

But my favorite Flex feature relates to its auto-adjusting security modes. Canary's software taps into your location using your cellular signal, Wi-Fi and GPS info. After you enter the address where your Flex is located, the app will automatically switch among Home and Away modes for you.

You can also customize these modes manually and program Night mode separately based on your sleep schedule.

Basically, when it notices the whole family is away from home, the app should automatically switch to Away mode. That's when you'll receive activity-based alerts. And when the software believes someone is home, you can choose how you'd like to receive alerts.

It's easy to extend access to other family members, too. Simply select ""Settings,"" ""Members"" and ""Add a member."" Enter in their name and email address and they'll get a message asking them to accept the invite, download the app and create their own account (which will link with your account and give them access to your Flex camera). The Flex's security modes worked well for me throughout testing and provided a layer of security beyond typical DIY cameras.

If you're looking for a live streaming HD security camera with a ton of installation freedom, I'd highly recommend the $199/£159 Canary Flex. This versatile camera is just as comfortable sitting on a living room table connected to a power adapter as it is mounted to your backyard fence, relying on rechargeable battery power.

The $250/£300 Netgear Arlo Pro is a reasonable alternative, but it costs more without adding much value. And, if you're just planning to keep your camera inside connected to a charger, you might also consider the $199 Nest Cam ($197.00 at Amazon.com) Indoor since it offers a lot of the same features as Flex, but bumps the resolution up to 1080p HD."
Netgear Arlo Pro review:|"

There's a lot to love about Netgear's $250/£300 Arlo Pro security camera. Its rechargeable battery is simpler to deal with than the original Netgear Arlo's expensive and hard-to-find CR123s. The Arlo Pro also adds in two-way audio so you can tell any unwelcome guests to get off your lawn, as well as receive audio alerts.

Otherwise, this indoor/outdoor DIY home security camera is essentially the same as the first-gen Arlo, which Netgear still sells for $180/£135. That's mostly a good thing, since Netgear nails the features category with seven days of free cloud storage, a wide-angle lens, a loud siren built-in to the Arlo Pro's next-gen Wi-Fi hub and compatibility with IFTTT and Samsung SmartThings platforms.

The Arlo Pro is a solid choice, particularly for outdoor, scalable security since Netgear sells multicamera kits and the hub can help extend the camera's reach beyond that of your WiFi router. I'd also consider the $199/£159 Canary Flex, as it has similar features with a more streamlined hub-free design.

The Arlo Pro shares a lot of similarities with the original Arlo camera. The main difference lies in the type of batteries Netgear uses. Instead of needing CR123 batteries to power a single Arlo camera, you get a single rechargeable battery with the Arlo Pro, designed to last for anywhere from four to six months.

Netgear also improved the required hub accessory that comes with your Arlo Pro purchase. Not only does the router-connected hub help extend the Wi-Fi range for longer distance outdoor camera installs (around 200 feet when I tested it, although Netgear claims it has a ""300+ feet line of sight"" range), this updated version also has a built-in 100-decibel siren.

You can use the related Android or iPhone Arlo app to program the siren to sound when the camera detects activity. The one hiccup is that the siren sounds from the hub, not from the cameras. So, if you have your cameras installed outside around the perimeter of your yard and the camera detects activity, the siren will only sound inside your house. 100 decibels is pretty loud, but it might not be strong enough to scare off someone lurking around outside preparing to steal your car.

The Arlo Pro also adds in two-way audio via a built-in microphone and speaker so you can communicate with someone at your front door or tell your dog to stop chewing on your shoe.

The Canary Flex and the Logi Circle are two Netgear Arlo Pro competitors. Check out the chart below to compare their main features and specs:

The Arlo Pro has a definite advantage over both the Canary Flex and the Logi Circle in terms of features. Its rechargeable battery is supposed to last longer, it offers free 7-day event-based cloud storage and it works with IFTTT and SmartThings.

And while I didn't test this camera over several months to fully explore its battery life, the battery indicator in the app is still showing that it's fully charged after roughly a week of testing. The Canary Flex is still showing a mostly full charge, but it's closer to 80 or 90 percent charged at this point.

At the same time, the Arlo Pro costs more than its competitors and some people won't want to deal with the added hassle of installing the related hub -- especially if they have no need for a Wi-Fi range extender.

The good news is that the Arlo Pro performed the same as Netgear's impressive first-gen Arlo camera.

Viewing the live feed was very simple, and I received prompt alerts related to any activity the camera detected.

At the same time, the Arlo Pro's night-vision capabilities were disappointing compared to the Canary Flex. As you can see in the screenshot above, the Arlo Pro brightly illuminated the table it was sitting on, but everything in the background was still difficult to see.

Canary's Flex had a much clearer night vision view, one that provided a clearer view of what was going on in the camera's field of view.

Even so, the Arlo Pro performed very well. I particularly liked that the Arlo Pro had arm/disarm security modes similar to the Flex that updated automatically via a geofencing radius.

The hub also did a decent job extending the camera's Wi-Fi range. I walked the camera roughly 350 feet away from the router and was unable to pull up the live feed. But as I walked back toward the router, the live feed began to work at around 200 feet away. That's a potential plus for anyone interested in installing these cameras beyond 150 feet.

Just keep in mind that the hub's Wi-Fi range could vary depending on the type of router you have and the quality of your internet connection.

The $250/£300 Netgear Arlo Pro is a smart choice if you plan to install security cameras outside your home due to the hub's extended Wi-Fi range. You can also use them inside for advanced install flexibility in places where you don't have easy access to an outlet. Still, I prefer the Canary Flex for flexible indoor/outdoor monitoring. The Flex's hardware and app are extremely well designed and you don't have to bother with a hub."
Belkin WeMo Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug review:|"

For a few years now, Belkin's WeMo line of smart home switches have been  	a reasonably affordable home automation starting point. Now, for 2017, Belkin figured it was time to refresh the lineup.

The main attraction is the new WeMo Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug, currently available for presale at a price of $35 (‎the Mini isn't available outside of the US yet, but other WeMo products are -- converted roughly, the price comes out to about £30 or AU$50). Just like the original WeMo Switch, it'll let you automate anything you plug in behind it, but like the name suggests, it's a lot smaller than before. That means it won't block off adjacent outlets like the old switches do.

Aside from the smaller design, there's really nothing new here. The WeMo Mini offers all of the same features as  	the original WeMo Switch, including its integrations with platforms and services like IFTTT, Nest, Google Home and Amazon's Alexa -- but still no support for Apple HomeKit, or for Siri. It won't track energy usage, either; for that, you'll need to spend a few bucks extra on a WeMo Insight Switch.

Lack of Siri controls aside, the WeMo Mini is still a well-connected smart plug, and a sensible follow-up purchase for anyone who got an Amazon Echo or a Google Home smart speaker for Christmas, as both will let you turn the plug on and off using voice commands. It isn't perfect, but at $35, the WeMo Mini is a safe, simple way to dip your toes into the connected home of tomorrow.

Smart plugs like the WeMo Mini are some of the simplest and most straightforward connected home gadgets you can buy. Plug one in and then plug something else into it, and you'll be able to turn that thing on and off from your phone, or automate it to turn on and off at specific times.

The most obvious use cases include lamps, space heaters, desk fans, and other small appliances you might want to automate, but there's room for creativity.

For instance, you could plug your entertainment center's power strip into a smart plug, then automatically cut the juice to your AV gear during the night when you aren't using any of it.

There's even a smart frying pan that can sync with a WeMo Switch to automatically cook your dinner.

Connecting your smart plugs with other smart home gadgets and services opens the door to even more possibilities. WeMo does pretty well here, boasting compatibility with Nest, IFTTT, Google Home and Amazon Alexa, among others.

It shouldn't be lost on anybody that the WeMo Mini looks a lot like two of its top competitors, the  iHome Smart Plug and the iDevices Switch. Both of those Belkin challengers went with small designs that don't block adjacent outlets, making the bulky first-gen WeMo Switch look dated by comparison. Updating the design was a necessary concession for Belkin -- and a clear sign that it's keen on keeping the WeMo Switch competitive on retail shelves.

It's a good move. After  selling millions of units last year, Amazon's Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers were both predictably hot sellers this holiday season -- and that means huge numbers of new potential customers for Belkin's Alexa-ready WeMo hardware.

Throw in the debut of the Google Home smart speaker, with which WeMo was an early partner, and you're looking at what's shaping up to be a big 2017 for voice-compatible smart home gadgets. No wonder Belkin wants its WeMo Switch ready for a fresh closeup.

But staying competitive with iHome and iDevices isn't just about cosmetics. Both of those smart plugs work with  Apple HomeKit, the set of smart home controls built into the software that powers iPhones and iPads. Like its predecessors, the WeMo Mini doesn't, and a Belkin spokesperson tells me that it isn't likely to anytime soon, since Belkin decided not to add in the necessary HomeKit chipset.

The goal, the company tells me, was to avoid a situation where some WeMo products worked with HomeKit while other WeMo products didn't. That means no HomeKit compatibility for any of them for the foreseeable future. With HomeKit still working to establish itself as a market mover, that'll either turn out to be a sage bit of restraint or a big missed opportunity for Belkin. My guess is that we'll know which by the end of this year.

Belkin does have one clear advantage, though, and that's the $35 price tag. It's a cheaper cost of entry than iHome or iDevices, and closer to what you'll pay for bargain-priced competitors from names like Koogeek and TP-Link, where Belkin's name recognition should serve it well.

The WeMo Mini uses the same Android and iOS app as existing WeMo devices. I'm holding out hope that Belkin will overhaul that app sometime this year. It's a good-looking piece of software that's pretty easy to navigate, but  it suffers from laggy performance -- a quibble that continued as I started testing out the new WeMo Mini.

To sync everything up, you'll follow the app's instructions and plug the WeMo Mini in, then wait a few seconds for it to start broadcasting its Wi-Fi signal. After connecting to that signal, you'll return to the app, where it'll tether the plug to your home network.

In my tests, this pairing process was typically pretty sluggish, often timing out and requiring me to force-quit the app. After launching it back up, the WeMo Mini would always be online and ready to go...but still, not a great first impression.

Things got better from there, though. To Belkin's credit, the app seemed noticeably faster than  the last time I tested it out for a post from the CNET Smart Home. Unlike in that round of tests, I didn't encounter the problem where my switches were listed as unresponsive.

The WeMo app offers a simple and intuitive rules engine that lets you get your feet wet with home automation. You could, for instance, create a rule that turns a lamp on at sunset, or when a WeMo motion detector catches you walking into the room.

In my home, I have a rule that turns off a space heater every night at 1:00 a.m.. If I ever forget to turn it off, WeMo will remember for me and keep it from running all night. Most importantly, the app makes it really easy to create those kinds of automations.

Syncing up with the Amazon Echo smart speaker was a cinch, too. Once the plug is up and running on your home network, just ask Alexa to discover new devices. Within seconds, she'll detect the WeMo Mini and add it to her list of supported gadgets, and you'll be able to tell her to turn it on and off using whatever name you picked for it in the WeMo app.

Commands like these worked perfectly in my tests, and in my own home, where I've regularly used an Amazon Echo to turn a lamp plugged into a WeMo Switch on and off for over a year now.

Controlling the switch using the Google Home smart speaker, with which Belkin's WeMo gear will soon enjoy native compatibility, should be just as easy once that integration is up and running. For deeper automated controls, it's fairly simple to connect your WeMo gear with the free online service IFTTT, too.

And remember, if you're turning your switches on and off with voice commands and automations like these, then you'll rarely need to open the app at all.

With the rise of internet-connected devices in our homes comes some legitimate security concerns, but Belkin's on pretty solid footing here. The company has done an admirable job of responding to potential vulnerabilities with regular firmware updates, and uses standard transport layer encryption for all transmissions to and from WeMo devices.

I spoke with a Belkin representative about  how WeMo handles security last year -- this is what the company said:

As with a lot of smart home gadgets, a lot of it comes down to how well-secured your home network is. Setting strong passwords and then updating them regularly is a good start, and if you need additional guidance,  we've got you covered.

At just $35 each, the WeMo Mini is one of the most affordable smart plugs on the market, and it's a perfect fit with voice controllers like the Amazon Echo or Google Home smart speakers. Integrations with IFTTT and with the Nest Learning Thermostat let you go even deeper into home automation if you choose.

If you were holding out for Apple HomeKit support and the Siri controls that come with it, then you're disappointed (and in that case, jumping in with iDevices or iHome is your best bet). For everyone else, I think the WeMo Mini deserves strong consideration. Like the original, it's a smart, simple way to get started with home automation, and the new, less obtrusive design is leaps and bounds better than before."
The Nutrismart kitchen scale recognizes produce and meat and gives calorie counts|"

Devices that scan bar codes on your food packages were popular at this year's CES in Las Vegas (just take a look at what happens when you scan an empty bottle of syrup on the GeniCan). But all of these products focus on packaged products rather than fresh food. French manufacturer Terraillon has taken a different approach: The company created a kitchen scale that can do a visual scan of your food and tell you its nutritional information.

The Nutrismart isn't available yet, but a Terraillon rep said the company  wants to begin selling the product in Europe later this year and in the US in 2018. The price will be about $200 (roughly  £160/AU$275).

The Nutrismart will weigh your produce or meat like a normal kitchen scale, and a small, built-in camera will scan the food. It will send that info to an app that will show you the nutritional information such as calories and water content.

The product sounds like it could be useful for folks who have to be very careful about what they eat and want exact calorie counts. But Terraillon will have to prove that a $200 scale is worthwhile when apps like MyFitnessPal will give you that info for free."
Curb your home's runaway energy usage with this sophisticated monitoring system|"

We've seen plenty of systems capable of tracking your home's energy usage, and even spent some time  testing one of them out in the CNET Smart Home. It's a patently good idea, but to date, we haven't seen a product that really nails the execution yet.

That's why I was so intrigued by what I heard from Curb, an Austin-based startup that's working to bring whole-home energy tracking to the masses. Curb founder and CEO Erik Norwood walked me through the system's ins and outs in a booth off the beaten path here at CES, and the more I listened, the more encouraged I became.

The core device is a $400 gadget that sits inside of your breaker box, with special sensors that clamp onto each circuit to track how much power they're putting out. Curb feeds that data to the cloud, letting you monitor everything in real time on your computer, or on your phone using Curb's app.

That's not dramatically different than other players in the space, including  Neurio, the system we reviewed back in 2015. And, like those competitors, you'll need to hire an electrician to install everything. From hands-on accounts on the web, that could take as long as 3 hours, and if you figure roughly $100 per hour for a good electrician's time, that adds up fast.

Curb's creators recognize that those installation woes are a major friction point for adoption. To that end, they came to Vegas with a potentially significant new partner:  Schneider Electric. You might never have heard of it (I hadn't before this week), but it's the name behind the largest manufacturer of residential breaker boxes. That could help Curb get its gadget installed in people's homes before they even move in.

Another strong point: Curb's software. Both the app and the web portal visualize your home's energy usage especially well, with a spinning radar-like display that shows your power consumption on a second-by-second basis. You can also view your usage over time, with stacked graphs that offer a clean breakdown of your consumption.

That data also makes Curb something of a connected home-enabler. After all, once you can track everything's power usage, you'll have an extra incentive to smarten all of it up so that you can automate it, or turn it off remotely.

""We don't want to make switches and thermostats to compete with Samsung and Nest,"" Norwood said. ""We'd rather be the conductor of the symphony.""

To that end, Curb boasts an integration with  Samsung's SmartThings connected home platform. Enable it, and you'll be able to turn your SmartThings-enabled lights and appliances on and off directly from Curb's web portal or app -- an easy way to take action as you comb through Curb's energy-tracking data.

I also like that, in addition to tracking energy consumption, Curb can track the energy production of any solar panels you might have installed. That's a good, forward-thinking feature for energy-conscious consumers.

Curb is available now in the US, and I think it's worth keeping on your radar. I'm itching to test it out in  the CNET Smart Home -- when that time comes, we'll let you know all of the ins and outs."
Hate folding laundry? Seven Dreamers Laundroid robot wants to help at CES 2017|"

Nobody likes doing laundry. And even after you've washed and dried everything, you still have to fold it all and put it away. Bummer.

Fortunately, startup Seven Dreamers wants to help out with this  everyday chore in the form of Laundroid, an imposing  laundry-folding-robot that looks kind of like a bottom freezer fridge.

Here's how it works:

Toss  up to 30-40 pieces of clothing into the drawer in the bottom. Laundroid  is then supposed to be able sort through what's inside and get to  folding. Its built-in AI and image analysis distinguishes among  t-shirts, pants and even underwear. It isn't able to fold socks, though.

From there, the robotic arm inside the appliance will pick up a single item at a time and spend the next 5 minutes or so folding it. No, it isn't very fast, but I suppose it's better than doing it yourself. Seven Dreamers also has a related Android and iPhone app for remote access to the bot.

We saw Laundroid previously as a prototype (it's been in development since 2005), but Seven Dreamers plans to open preorders worldwide in March. Pricing hasn't yet been announced.

In addition to this Laundroid unit, the company also plans to introduce a custom version for hospitals and nursing homes in 2018, as well as an all-in-one washer, dryer and laundry folder in 2019. In the meantime, we hope to track down a review unit of Laundroid to try out for ourselves at the CNET Smart Home.

These Inirv React cooktop knobs keep you from burning the house down|"

Admit it: You've put some ramen in a pot on the stove, stepped out of the kitchen and forgot all about your instant meal. Hopefully, you caught your mistake before a fire broke out. But a startup called Inirv Labs wants to make sure you avoid household disasters with knobs that will automatically shut off your burners if you forget you're cooking.

This week at CES in Las Vegas, Inirv hooked up its system -- called the Inirv React -- to a cooktop and demonstrated how it will keep your kitchen (and ramen) safe. The company also launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for the product this week, and it surpassed its $40,000 goal within three days. The system will cost $299 when it's released, and it will come with four knobs and a sensor. That price converts roughly to £245 in the UK and AU$410 in Australia.

Here's how $299 Inirv React system works:

You'll be able to change the settings and disable the turn-off feature in the app in case you need your burner on for long periods of time, like if you're making a stew over low heat for a couple of hours.

You mount a sensor to your kitchen ceiling. The sensor is Wi-Fi- as well as Bluetooth-connected, and it can detect smoke, gas and motion.Pop off your old burner knobs and replace them with Inirv knobs, which are also Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-enabled.The sensor will prompt the knobs to automatically shut off your burner if it detects a hazard like smoke or fire, and it doesn't detect any motion from you.The Inirv's iOS and Android app will also send you a notification to let you know that it's about to shut your burner off."
Dok Talk lets you charge all of the things, and chat with Alexa, too|"

""Alexa everywhere."" That's been one of the top themes of CES 2017, with device makers large and small introducing new skills for Amazon's smash-hit voice-activated assistant. And, with Amazon having made it relatively easy for device-makers to code the virtual helper directly into their products, we're also seeing lots of new gadgets that come with Alexa built right in.

Enter Dok Talk, which makes a wide assortment of multi-device charging stations. Their newest, the Dok Talk CR25, features a little microphone button on top -- give it a tap, and voila, there's Alexa, ready to take your question or command.

The device itself has five USB inputs capable of charging both phones and tablets (complete with protection against over-charging), as well as a Bluetooth speaker in the base and a Qi wireless charging pad that'll let you charge a sixth device. It looks capable enough as a basic bedside charging station (if not a bit generic), but the addition of Alexa makes it into something a lot more compelling, especially given Alexa's ever-growing library of third-party skills.

It's good evidence that Alexa is proving to be a rising tide for in-home tech. Even off-brand, otherwise unremarkable devices like this one can bring in Alexa where it makes sense; in doing so, they get to expand the functionality of what they're selling to a near-exponential degree.

Of course, it also gives companies that make bargain-bin junk an excuse to jack up the price of what they're hocking. I'm not saying that's what Dok Talk's up to here (and I can't speak to the quality of the device until we test one out), but I'll still be curious to see how the CR25's yet-to-be-determined asking price compares to the company's non-Alexa-enabled chargers when it arrives later this year.

For now, Dok Talk says the plan is to sell it for less than the Amazon Echo's current asking-price of $180 in the US and £149 in the UK (The Echo isn't currently available in Australia, but its price converts roughly to AU$245). Hopefully, it's a  lot less given that those standard Dok Talk chargers run for about $80 in the US, and unlike the Echo the Dok Talk makes you press a button to wake Alexa up.

The CR25 is heading to market later this year, both on Dok Talk's website and on Amazon.  Dok Talk also plans to sell a less expensive version of the charger that keeps Alexa, but ditches the Qi charging pad. Both will ship worldwide."
SolarGaps turns window decor into solar panels at CES|"

Opening the blinds has never been so helpful. On display here at CES in Las Vegas, SolarGaps turns the actual slats of your window coverings into solar panels. SolarGaps blinds will be smart enough to shift their angle slightly throughout the day in order to maximize their power intake. The company also plans to integrate with the Google Home.

I'd love to control solar-powered blinds with my voice using Google's always-listening assistant, but note that Google's smart home language -- Weave -- doesn't actually work with blinds yet. SolarGaps could be extra exciting if it's an indication of a whole new smart home product category for Google Home. Or SolarGaps could be a small tech startup trying to make noise at CES by name-dropping Google. I'm hoping for the former.

Google Home aside, SolarGaps will have iOS and Android apps. The company also wants to integrate with Nest and SmartThings. If your Nest senses it's too cold, it could send a signal to your blinds to let in more light and heat your place naturally.

SolarGaps has a control box that responds to gestures, and the app has the functionality you'd expect -- basic controls and scheduling. SolarGaps blinds should cost between $480 to $890 per square meter of window, and they don't look the part of high-priced designer blinds. They look like big, black solar panels.

Still, if you prioritize energy and convenience over style, SolarGaps blinds will be worth keeping an eye on, especially if the company can pull off that Google Home integration. SolarGaps will start a crowdfunding campaign in February for a planned release in the middle of the year. (UK and Australian details weren't available, but those prices convert to roughly £390 and £725 or AU$660 and AU£1,220.)"
Wave at Bixi, then whisper to Alexa at CES 2017|"

We're enamored with the possibilities of the voice-controlled smart home. The first version of Bixi went a different direction. The Bluetooth-enabled, puck-shaped device sensed motion to allow you control over your home with gestures.

The second-generation Bixi, due out by the end of the year, keeps the same idea intact. Lift your hand over it to raise the volume of your speakers, or wave your hand across it to flip the page on your iPad. Bixi 2 will also accommodate those of us that love to use our voice with an Alexa integration.

Both Bixis respond to seven different gestures. They talk to your phone or tablet via Bluetooth, and Bixi 2 will connect directly to Wi-Fi. You can program Bixi to control any Bluetooth device, and via Wi-Fi hopefully Bixi will be able to talk to a lot more smart home devices -- though a Bixi rep wouldn't offer specifics.

I saw both Bixis on display at CES 2017. The first was released in France last year and will be coming to the US in March. The motion-sensing tech looks cool, especially if you're in the kitchen and handling food. The small, portable Bixi is easy to take with you and its rechargeable battery lasts a month.

You'll need to be within 6 to 8 inches to get a response from Bixi. That limitation was intentional to help prevent accidental usage from your ordinary gestures. Still, the short range makes me wonder how useful it would be rather than just pulling out your phone. Alexa will help, though Amazon's assistant won't be always listening via Bixi as she is in the Amazon Echo. You'll have to wake Bixi up with a wave, then you'll be able to command Alexa normally.

If you'd like options for controlling your smart home, the motion-sensing, Alexa-enabled Bixi 2 will be out by the end of the year. A Bixi rep wouldn't confirm a price, though the first Bixi will cost $100 when it comes out in the US in March. If Bixi 2 is much more than that, I'll have a tough time seeing its value over the original $180 Amazon Echo."
Amazon's Alexa will work with Gourmia's new coffemaker, tea brewer and sous vide circulator|"

You can lounge in your bed and tell Amazon's Alexa to start your coffee, tea or sous vide circulator thanks to a new Skill from small appliance manufacturer Gourmia.

Gourmia displayed a new line of six Wi-Fi-enabled appliances at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. The company hasn't released prices for these countertop gadgets, and they anticipate a release in the second quarter of 2017. You'll be able to control all the of appliances through Gourmia's new app, but three of those appliances will work with Alexa, Amazon's voice-activated digital assistant:

The controls will work thanks to a Skill (aka the capabilities that you enable Alexa to perform) called Mia. So if you want some tea in the morning, you'll be able to say, ""Alexa, tell Mia to start my tea.""

Integration with Alexa has been big at this year's CES. And we've already seen small appliances like the Joule sous vide circulator work with Alexa.

Bosch made a countertop robot with recipe smarts|"

Meet Mykie, the digital robot that wants to be your sous chef. Bosch displayed its concept countertop smart speaker at CES in Las Vegas this week. Mykie, short for ""my kitchen elf,"" is similar to smart speakers like Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) or Google Home ($129.00 at Jet.com): You can use voice controls to ask Mykie questions such as, ""What's the weather today?"" It will also be able to control connected Bosch appliances like dishwashers and ovens. Mykie's main goal is to help you cook. You can search for recipes with voice commands or on Mykie's control screen, and Mykie will project videos of someone preparing the recipe on your kitchen wall.

Mykie is very much in the development stage, and still has some kinks. During a CES demo, we asked Mykie to search for recipes with cumin as an ingredient. Mykie heard, ""search for recipes with human."" But it's an ambitious attempt by a big appliance manufacturer to try to wedge its way into the smart home market."
Is it a robot vac or a security cam? Well, both actually|"

With brands like iRobot, Neato and Dyson leading the charge with app-enabled robot vacuums, floor cleaners are getting a lot smarter. Case in point? Ecovacs Robotics Unibot.

Like  many other models on the market today, Unibot is lithium-ion powered  and has a 90- to 100-minute expected run time. It also has a related  app, where you can program your bot to clean automatically at certain  times and even view a map of rooms and where you want it to clean.

But Unibot is doing something that I've never seen with any other robo-vac before -- it has a couple of optional accessories.

Yes, Unibot is compatible with a standard-definition Ecovacs-brand security camera, as well as an air purifier module. They're designed to sit on top of the robot vacuum. Of course, both can't ride on top of the bot at the same time, but you can choose the accessory you want -- either the camera or the purifier.

Ecovacs also plans to integrate with smart home tech when it launches in the US in the second half of 2017. Think voice control integrations and possibly more with lighting, climate and other connected home devices. Unibot wants to be the heart of your smart home.

iBaby is releasing a dancing digital assistant|"

Baby-tech startup iBaby has cemented itself in the monitoring industry over the past couple of years because of a few creative design decisions -- most notably replacing the actual monitor with a smart phone, and focusing more on the camera. Their feature-rich cameras, like the M6S, are some of the best on the market.

And now, they're bringing that experience to Yobi, a voice assistant and robot for the whole family. At $400, Yobi isn't cheap. But when I talked to iBaby President Elnaz Sarraf at CES 2017, she assured me that you get what you pay for -- a premium device.

Yobi's base functions include facial and voice recognition, voice-command response and the ability to speak and understand multiple languages -- English, Chinese, Spanish, French and more.

On top of this foundation, iBaby has layered a slew of other features:

Sarraf says Yobi also will change over time, depending on how users utilize it. Eventually, its intuitive responses will be personalized to you, although how exactly this will shake out remains to be seen.

In the brief time I worked with Yobi, I saw an assistant that works well -- but not one with the same development and interoperability as, say, Alexa or Aristotle. I'm excited to see how Yobi develops over time, because for any voice assistant, personality is key. What really distinguishes Siri from Alexa from Google Assistant and so on, is the way interacting with each of them feels.

If Yobi can create a compelling personality, and bring uniquely child-oriented features, it could represent another exciting entry in the emerging field of kid-friendly voice and robot assistants.

iBaby plans to make Yobi available in Q2 of 2017.

Nora listens while you sleep, nudges you when you snore|"

Anybody who shares a bed -- or even just a room -- with someone who snores knows how frustrating trying to get a good night's sleep can be. The best way to quiet the person down is usually just to poke them, which can make the whole night a series of sleeping periods, punctuated by snoring, waking and poking. Now there's a machine that will break up that rhythm by doing the poking for you.

Smart Nora consists essentially of two parts: an electronic sensor that rests on a bedside table and listens for repeating sounds in a particular frequency range (i.e. snoring); and an inflation device that slides underneath the snorer's pillow and blows up when they snore, repositioning their head. Altogether, the gadget will set you back about $300 (however, at the time of writing, it was on sale for $260).

It's difficult to measure how successful Smart Nora actually is -- especially since the snorers themselves shouldn't notice much of a difference. But the logic behind the device seems sound. The electronics are kept away from the head. The device is designed to filter out bedroom noises -- although false positives shouldn't be an issue if the device truly is nonintrusive, as the developers claim.

Nora also offers some additional smarts: you don't have to use it with an app, but if you choose to do so, you can record audio and track your snoring to make sure the device really is making a difference. The app will also tell users if their snoring might indicate sleep apnea, and whether they should consult a doctor. Obviously, Smart Nora isn't a medical device, but getting a tip if you or a loved one has apnea is a great perk.

Of course, Smart Nora also has some apparent issues before even testing it. First off, many people are restless sleepers, or roll around during the night. If such a person were to roll off the pillow, then Nora couldn't do anything to affect their snoring.

Second, the $300 price tag isn't too appealing. Sure, the tech behind the device is interesting. It might even help mitigate snoring. But it's hard to swallow a $300 surcharge before testing it for yourself -- especially when you can find plenty of low-tech snoring solutions for under a hundred bucks.

Here are Smart Nora's measurements:

Length of a queen pillow: 50 cm by 15 cmFolds in half for easier travel: 25cm by 10 cm"
Nvidia Spot is like a Google Home you stick on your wall|"

The Google Assistant's expanding its repertoire as an entertainer. At CES, Nvidia showed off the new Shield TV. Say the word and you can search for content, pause or rewind with your voice, all powered by Google's software. The Shield TV will even display information if you search the internet, and it works with SmartThings to control your home. If you buy the $200 streamer, you won't even have to be in the same room to talk to Google, thanks to a $50 add-on called the Nvidia Spot.

The Shield TV is out later this month. The Spot's release date hasn't been specified. An always listening controller with the Google Assistant built-in, the Nvidia Spot sure sounds a lot like a Google Home. The Spot looks different -- a round orb as opposed to a white cylinder. You'll also be able to easily move the Spot from room to room and even attach it to walls.

Otherwise, a lot of the functionality sounds the same as Google's own product -- you'll be able to command your TV, search the web and control your smart home via voice command. Nvidia specified SmartThings integration for Spot and Shield, but Google Assistant works with more platforms than that on Google Home -- so I wonder if Spot has a more limited version of the Assistant.

Nvidia's platform will offer more streaming options than Google's products can do on their own. With a Google Home and a Chromecast streamer plugged into your TV, you can control Netflix and YouTube with your voice. Shield's promised those platforms, plus Amazon Video, Google Play movies and Vudu.

We've been looking for Google Home to expand its functionality at CES. The Shield TV is a nice step -- if somewhat redundant. The Spot itself looks to serve the same purpose as Home, and the integration expands upon something the Google Assistant already did. Still, I'm glad to see the Google Assistant gaining new partners -- it needs to in order to keep up with Amazon at CES."
Hello Egg is part smart speaker, part cooking assistant|"

If you're a crappy cook, the Hello Egg might be the kitchen assistant to guide you pass burnt grilled cheese sandwiches.

Makers of this smart speaker-like gadget showed off the Hello Egg's skills, which include voice recognition and video projection, at CES in Las Vegas Thursday. The Hello Egg will cost $120 (roughly £100 or AU$205, converted) for a basic version and $350 (about £290 or AU$475) for a premium version when it's released later this year.

Hello Egg is like an Amazon Echo designed just for your kitchen.  It looks like the crystal ball the Wicked Witch of the West used to spy on Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" with an eye that looks like an egg yolk that moves around the screen. You can ask your Hello Egg for a recipe, and it will project videos that how to complete each step. And, true to its name and egg-timer-like shape, it can act as your kitchen timer, too.

You can preorder a Hello Egg online. Its creators also plan to launch an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for the product in March."
The CloudTot packs smart features into a comfy co-sleeper|"

Much ado has been made about wearable monitors for infants -- and with some legitimacy. Infants are susceptible to apnea and SIDS, and if tech could reduce those risks, it'd be a big deal. The problem is, no one's been able to prove monitors really help, mostly because research on the topic is nearly impossible.

Yet every year at CES, new gadgets come out to monitor children and reassure parents. The CloudTot is one of those devices, but it also includes some features that just make parenting an infant easier. And for $250 (converts to AU$340, £200), the co-sleeper isn't as steep as many non-connected competitors on the market.

The CloutTot has three important smart features. First, it includes a speaker for emitting white noise, playing music and listening for the baby's cries. You can control the speaker from the CloudTot app, which also will send you notifications if your child wakes up and cries during a nap in the other room.

The device also includes a pad that detects moisture, so if the child wets the bed, you'll get an alert on the app. The materials are easily disentangled from the electronics, so you can put them all through the washer.

Finally, the CloudTot includes two ""Pep pegs,"" which prod the child if they sense no motion for twelve seconds. The logic behind the pegs is that autonomic functions (like breathing) are underdeveloped in young infants, so in deep sleep, they can essentially forget to breath. The Pep peg will gently prod the child to rouse them and encourage breathing again. The device will also notify a parent via the app.

The CloudTot will be available for preorder beginning in February 2017."
Breezi AirPulse comes to CES with an eye on your home heating system|"

Most of us never want to have to think about your HVAC system. Fortunately the Breezi Airpulse, launched at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, is here to help further that cause. It'll supposedly allow you to spend less time worrying as the AirPulse will keep an eye out for problems on your behalf.

The AirPulse is a Bluetooth sensor that sticks into the filters near your air vents. From there, it senses the pressure on either side of the vent to gauge the life of the filter. You'll be able to check on the filter's status on your phone using Breezi's iOS or Android app.

You'll also receive a push notification when your filter nears the end of its life. The tip of the Airpulse -- the side inside the filter -- also has acoustic sensors. The HVAC pros that started Breezi programmed Airpulse to listen for specific frequencies in the way the air is blowing. Based on the type of HVAC system you have, supposedly, AirPulse can use the sound of the air blowing past it to diagnose potential problems before you'd normally notice them.

Due out this Spring, you'll be able to buy the Breezi AirPulse for $30, or you can sign up for a subscription service for $20 a month that includes two AirPulses, and automatic replacement of your vents when they run out of life.

Weirdly, Breezi doesn't use Bluetooth 5 yet, even though Bluetooth's showing off the longer range version of the signal prominently at CES. Breezi's reps assured me that's an upgrade they'd like to implement in the near future."
Honeywell's scalable security cam lets you decide what matters|"

It's hard to find a security camera that's truly versatile, but Honeywell's new Lyric C2 Wi-Fi Indoor Camera is an exception. With local storage, free cloud storage an optional cloud storage upgrade, as well as optional professional monitoring, the Lyric C2 really lets you decide how you want to manage your home security.

Are you a budding DIYer interested in experimenting with home security for the first time? You can buy a single Lyric C2, install it yourself and use local storage -- an 8GB SD card comes with your camera purchase -- or the free cloud storage to review old footage.

Are you sold on a more comprehensive security and smart-home system? You can buy multiple Lyric C2's, have a professional dealer install them and integrate them with Honeywell's own professionally monitored security system. Not only will you have the cameras watching over things, the installer will also configure sensors, control panels, thermostats (video below) and other connected devices to work alongside them.

Here's an overview of the Lyric C2's specs:

In addition to the Lyric C2, Honeywell also added the Lyric C1 Wi-Fi indoor camera to its lineup today. The Lyric C1 has a lot of the same features as the Lyric C2, although it's a more paired-down version with a 135-degree field of view and just two detection zones. Honeywell hasn't released pricing information for the Lyric C2 or C1 just yet, but the cameras should be available within the first few months of 2017.

Honeywell also announced that its Lyric Home Security and Control System now works with Apple's smart-home platform, HomeKit. Read more about this news here.

4moms shows off tech-packed Moxi stroller at CES 2017|"

Ever feel like you're just being wasteful spending so much time walking with your child? Okay, maybe not -- but baby-tech developer 4moms has designed a stroller to get even more out of those trips to the park, and it's brought it to CES 2017.

The Moxi stroller uses the kinetic energy of its wheels, generated by walking with your child, to charge your phone, light your path with headlights and track your distance on an LCD screen. Pretty cool, right? The bad news is, it costs a steep $700 (converts to roughly AU$950, £570).

Moxi offers a few extra design features to sweeten the deal, though. Most notably, the seat can reorient in three different ways. It can face forward or backward, and it can lie flat for young infants. This feature alone will cost a pretty penny with many high-end strollers -- so the price tag isn't quite as bad as it initially might seem.

My only two critiques of the stroller itself as I've seen thus far are its relatively simple app and its weak headlights. The app and LCD screen currently display distance traveled, but I'd like to see more creative information and analysis of walks.

The headlights look nice, but they certainly aren't strong enough to light a dark path. Most parents won't be out after dark with their children anyway, but it'd be nice to see the features have real use to them, other than as extra lines on a feature-list.

The Moxi stroller is available online now for $700.

Happiest Baby Snoo is the fanciest baby bed you can admire at CES 2017|"

How much do you love your kid? Would you drop $1,160 to give them a better night of sleep? Head to CES 2017, where influential tech designer Yves Béhar and legendary doctor Harvey Karp (inventor of the Five S's for soothing infants) have teamed up to create a baby bed called the Happiest Baby Snoo. But it won't come cheap.

The Snoo bed is no standard sleeper, it's heavy duty. It takes two people to carry comfortably, and it looks great. All that is due to Behar's design, which eschews the gaudy colors and cheap plastic that adorn most baby-tech these days, and instead uses high quality woods, fabrics and metals.

The features, too, set Snoo apart from the competition. It will rock children and use white noise to soothe them, but how it does so is carefully calibrated to respond to the particular needs of the child. So the baby is sleeping, Snoo will emit a low frequency noise and rock more slowly. If the child begins to wake up and cry, the bed will rock more rapidly and raise the frequency of its noise emissions.

The bed also includes swaddling sacks that keep children on their backs during their first six months of life, and are made of mesh to keep them from overheating.

The concepts behind Snoo aren't new, but their execution could very well be more successful, given the minds and research behind the device. That said, the $1,160 price tag will simply seem like an absurd prospect for most parents -- especially since the device will work for only six or seven months for many children.

I'm looking forward to testing out the Happiest Baby Snoo soon, but I'm looking forward even more to the price dropping so parents can do more than look on wistfully at one more device they won't buy for their kid."
Hugo's Hubble cam talks to Alexa and can tell when you're pissed off|"

Not only can the Hubble Hugo follow you as you move around the room, but it'll watch your face and try to tell how you're feeling. Complete with Alexa integration, the Hugo is a smart cam from tech startup Hubble that plays music, controls your smart home and keeps track of when you're angry. I got all up his face at CES here in Las Vegas.

Now, I typically don't need a camera to tell me when I'm excited, but this feature of Hugo isn't just a novelty. In particular, it's meant to help you monitor your baby. Hugo can both tell you when your baby starts crying and then automatically play music or turn on a fan. The Hubble cloud also has a few audio books for kids it can play.

Thanks to the Alexa integration, you'll be able to command Hugo to set reminders or alarms, as well as any of the other tricks up the massive sleeves of Amazon's digital assistant.

Hugo has motion detection, an SD card and can spin 360 degrees, so it has the features to function well as a smart home security cam as well as a baby monitor. Since it reads faces so well, it makes sense that it also can tell people from animals, so you won't get an alert if you're away and your pet crosses into view.

You'll be able to store 24 hours of footage on the cloud for free, or you can pay a monthly fee and store footage for longer.

Hugo will be available to help you sort your emotions this summer. The price hasn't been finalized, but the company's reps at CES expect it to fall between $250 and $300 (about £250 or AU$400).

During the demo, I was impressed by the novelty. I could see my face on a screen and Hugo would pick up my smiles and frowns and read my emotions accordingly, though I'm not sure of it's ability to track subtlety. Then again, crying babies aren't exactly subtle. However, I'm worried Hugo would lose track if the baby rolls over -- as it seemed to struggle with faces at an angle."
The Google of China wants to take on Alexa|"

We're seeing quite a few Alexa voice assistant copycats at CES this year. Each promises to be unique in some way, but all offer the same basic tricks that the Amazon Echo has offered for a couple of years -- control your smart home, play music and provide personal assistance. A product called the Little Fish looks at first glance to be yet another knockoff, but given that it's from the Chinese internet giant Baidu -- known as ""the Google of China"" -- the Little Fish might just have the clout to keep up.

Unlike the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, the Baidu Little Fish has a large screen to display additional information after you ask a question. It also has a camera, with which it can supposedly recognize your face and customize its answers accordingly. You'll be able to hold video chats on a Little Fish, and stream videos directly to the screen.

Otherwise, expect the usual Echo functionality. Baidu will try to get a leg up on these fronts with advanced AI for a more conversational assistant. That's how Google tried to beat the Echo, with the conversational Google Assistant, but Alexa keeps making strides on this front as well. We're still waiting for a digital assistant to perfect natural give-and-take-in voice commands. Perhaps Baidu can be the one to pull this off.

The Baidu Little Fish was on display at CES last week in Las Vegas. No word yet on pricing, availability or even what smart home platforms it'll work with.

Editors' note, January 9, 2017: After some back and forth on the name, the company settled on Little Fish over Fishhome."
Habit shows at CES 2017 how to use blood to know what you should eat|"

A diet might make the weight melt off one person, while someone else eating the same food could gain some pounds. A startup called Habit promises to find the right meal plan for you by analyzing your blood, DNA and Fitbit steps.

Habit showed off their $299 at-home kit (roughly converting to £241 or AU$408) for collecting your vitals at a CES preview event Wednesday (ironically, right next to a table full of hot dogs for the press). The kit includes everything you need to collect your biometrics for them to analyze: lancets for blood samples, mouth swabs for DNA samples and a tape measure for your body dimensions. You send everything back to Habit, and they'll analyze your information to create a food profile that recommends food you should eat to lose weight.

You can order a Habit kit if you live in the San Francisco area. Founder and CEO Neil Grimmer said Tuesday the company will eventually expand nationwide.

Habit has also partnered with Fitbit, the fitness company responsible for those ubiquitous step trackers. Once you sync your Fitbit and Habit accounts, Habit can recommend how many calories you should eat daily based on the number of steps you take.

Habit also includes an optional personalized meal delivery service and health coaching in its offerings."
Black & Decker's Smartech Robotic Vacuum keeps smarts, cuts price at CES|"

Despite robot vacuum competition heating up, we're still waiting for a competent model at a reasonable price. Maybe Black & Decker's first entry into the field -- the Smartech Robotic Vacuum on display at CES -- can fill that void.

Sure, we quite like models from iRobot and Neato, but expect to shell out $700 plus for a current gen model and upward of $500 even for an older Neato. Starting in March, you'll be able to buy any one of four new Black & Decker bots priced between $300 and $400.

At the top of the range, the $400 Smartech bot has features competitive with iRobot and Neato. Like the recent Neato Botvac Connected and Roomba 980, you can steer the Smartech bot with an app on your phone and set a schedule for it.

Better yet, the $400 Smartech bot senses whether it's vacuuming carpet or hardwood and switches modes automatically. We saw Smartech debuted on stick vacuums at CES last year. The rest of its specs are competitive as well.

A couple of gimmicks -- you can also change the color of an LED on top of the Smartech vac and name it in the app -- round out the features.

Unfortunately, those two add-ons aren't the first to go when you start cutting the price for the cheaper models. The $380, $350, and $300 models primarily cut the anti-tangle brush, battery life, and smarts respectively.

Regardless, if the Smartech line can navigate and clean as well as the high-priced competition, Black & Decker's army of robo vacs will be well positioned to move in on iRobot and Neato's turf.

It's the Griffin Technology Connected Toaster... because CES|"

Whenever someone speaks disparagingly about the smart home, they'll often express their skepticism with a pejorative reference to a hypothetical internet-connected toaster.

People, I've found this toaster -- or the latest attempt at it, at least.

The magical device comes by way of Griffin Technology, a self-described manufacturer of ""useful and fun solutions."" And, if your problem is poorly toasted bread, then boy, do they have a solution for you.

It's called the Connected Toaster, and it boasts a Bluetooth radio and a smartphone app. It costs $100 (which converts to roughly AU$140 or £60). It is not a joke. Its sole mission is to toast your favorite breads and bagels to crusty, app-enabled perfection. Sync everything up, and you'll be able to dial in to the precise toast settings you're craving with just a few taps. And, should the need to toast bread ever arise once more, never fear -- the app will remember your preferences.

Of course, an untouched rotary dial is pretty good at remembering your preferred setting, too. Just sayin'.

Still, in fairness, $100 actually isn't that terribly outrageous for a nice-looking, high-end toaster. In fact, we've tested and reviewed designer toasters that cost as much as $500. No apps for any of those, though.

And after all, this is CES. If it ain't broke, put Bluetooth in it."
Griffin Technology takes a stab at the smart mirror at CES 2017|"

CES has seen its share of smart mirrors, and this year, it's Griffin Technology who's hoping the idea finally sticks.

Their product is called, simply enough, the Connected Mirror, and it's a shiny, reflective surface that connects with your home Wi-Fi network in order to display the local time and weather and any missed notifications from your phone, as well as updates from any other Griffin gear under your roof (their catalog includes app-enabled phone chargers, a connected coffeemaker, and even a Bluetooth toaster).

Those updates will appear whenever you touch the mirror's capacitive surface, then disappear when you're done with them. You can also use Griffin's app to connect with the mirror in order to choose the information you want it to display.

None of that will come cheap, though. When it arrives at the end of 2017, Griffin's Connected Mirror will cost you a cool $1,000 (about £810 or AU$1,390, converted roughly). At that price -- and without any notable third-party integrations to get people who've already bought into the smart home excited about it -- it's hard to see this as more than a luxury niche product.

Still, this isn't the only smart mirror we've seen at CES this year, so perhaps this is an untapped category that's ready to emerge. We'll keep our eyes on it."
ShadeCraft Sunflower solar patio umbrella follows the sun at CES 2017|"

I love being outside, but direct sunlight can be kind of annoying. Fortunately, Los-Angeles-based robotics startup ShadeCraft has come up with a seriously cool solution -- the Sunflower.

The Sunflower is an autonomous patio umbrella/shade that has a ridiculous amount of tech packed into it, all designed to keep you comfortable no matter the outdoor conditions. ShadeCraft says the Sunflower won't be ready until 2018, but here's a list of its promised smarts:

While we've seen all sorts of cool one-off products and ideas expand into bigger trends -- Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield), anyone? -- we haven't seen anything quite like Sunflower before. It certainly seems like a clever way to manage the sun, but we'll just have to see it for ourselves. We're tracking down Sunflower here at CES for hands-on photos and video, so check back soon.

At CES, the Rokid Pebble adds a personal touch to digital assistance|"

If the Rokid Pebble works as promised, maybe the name Melody will become just as recognizable as  	Alexa or Siri. If not, this aptly named spherical assistant could be just another Amazon Echo wannabe.

Launching this summer in the US, the Pebble listens for you to say the wake word ""Melody,"" then responds to your commands. Much like the Echo and Alexa, you don't have to touch the Pebble, just talk to it, and it'll add items to your calendar, play music, and control your smart home.

The Pebble looks capable as an entertainer -- you'll be able to stream music from  	Spotify and iHeartRadio -- and as a smart home controller -- it'll work with Nest, Philips Hue, Wink and IFTTT at launch with a SmartThings integration in the works. The Pebble will chart its own course by being able to recognize your voice and customize its responses accordingly.

Because it can recognize voices, the Pebble should be able to beat the Echo as a personal assistant. You can train Melody to do different things when you greet it as opposed to when your significant other does. So simply by saying ""Melody, hello,"" it'll set the thermostat, turn on the lights, and follow any other preset commands you've specified. If your significant other says the same thing, Melody can greet him or her by name and do an entirely different set of commands.

Rokid's Melody also looks to be quite good at keeping your calendar organized. While Alexa, Siri and the Google Assistant are rudimentary at best at helping you manage your schedule, Melody will be able to sync all of your individual calendars, and all of the calendars for your entire family. Then, Melody can check them all and let you know when you're all free.

The Pebble is the second assistant from tech startup Rokid. The first -- the Rokid Alien -- has been available in China since April. The Alien functions much like the Pebble, only it also has a screen and a camera. The camera can recognize your face and the screen can display additional context and info if you ask it a question.

Both the Pebble and the Alien will be available for purchase in the US starting this summer, though Rokid doesn't yet have pricing information for either. Both also have a small battery that'll keep them powered for around two hours, making them more mobile than the Amazon Echo -- which always has to stay plugged in.

Between the Amazon Echo, the  Google Home and Siri's HomeKit on your iPhone, you already have lots of options for a digital assistant. At CES, we've seen many more contenders that want to vie for that position, so the Rokid Pebble will need to be affordable and polished if it hopes to have a chance of standing out among tough competition. The promise of individualized assistance for multiple users is enticing, though, and if it can help you and your family organize your lives, Melody might well earn her way toward the front of the bunch."
Incipio's got a smart light switch at CES that works with Siri and Alexa|"

Incipio already makes  a smart plug and a smart light bulb adapter that both work with Apple HomeKit for Siri-ready voice controls. Now, the gadget maker is announcing two new ""CommandKit"" products that will join them, including a $60 Wi-Fi light switch that'll let Siri dim the lights, no hub needed. And, in case you're a little more fond of Alexa, the switch will work with Amazon's virtual assistant, too.

The new switch really couldn't have picked a better time to debut. Though it hasn't proven itself to be a major market mover yet, Apple HomeKit is nonetheless starting to get pretty compelling thanks to  strong security standards and growing diversity of compatible gadgets (and Siri tricks to go with them). On the Amazon side, sales of the Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers are through the roof -- meaning more people than ever are on the lookout for nifty new Alexa-ready gadgets.

I'm a fan of the price, too. At $60, Incipio's Wi-Fi switch will cost a lot less than other dimmable smart light switches that work with Siri or Alexa (let alone both). The price converts to a little less than £50 or about AU$85.

The potential trade-off? Incipio's switch doesn't sound like it'll be quite as feature-rich as those alternatives, and the design isn't quite as sharp as what we've seen from names like  Lutron or iDevices, or from the upcoming Belkin WeMo Dimmer Switch.

There is a motion sensor in the center of the switch that can trigger lighting changes, though. That's a really nice addition, since you'll never need to worry about changing its battery. It also looks like both of the dimming buttons, including the one that raises the brightness, are positioned on the bottom half of the switch, which might take a little getting used to.

Incipio's smart switch is slated to hit the market by July of this year. We'll keep an eye out for it, then let you know how it stacks up against the competition."
Incipio CommandKit smart power strip works with both HomeKit and Amazon Echo|"

Incipio brought some new smart gadgets to CES, including a new $100 ""CommandKit"" Wi-Fi power strip that you can control using both Siri and Alexa voice commands.

With four automatable outlets that you can can control independent of one another, this thing is basically a four-way  WeMo Switch that'll let you automate four things at once. Aside from syncing it up with Apple HomeKit or with one of Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices to control it with your voice, you'll also be able to turn the outlets on and off from Incipio's app, or by scheduling them to turn on and off at specific times.

That Apple HomeKit compatibility also lets you control the outlets using Apple's Home app on your iPhone or iPad. You can also pin outlets to the Control Center, then swipe up and tap to turn them on and off -- no app needed.

The power strip's other big trick is that it'll track the energy usage of whatever you're plugging into it. That's a nice little bonus, and an added value if you're looking to cut your consumption. Automation can help with that.

At $100 (about £80 or AU$140, converted roughly), this is definitely expensive for a power strip, but it costs a lot less than you'd spend on four switches from iDevices or Belkin WeMo. Provided you've got four things right next to each other that you're ready to plug in and automate, it sounds like it might be a smart buy once it hits the market this summer. We'll keep an eye out for it."
LG's new fleet of robohelpers includes one that'll mow your lawn|"

Internet of things? More like internet of robots -- at least if you ask LG. At the Korean manufacturer's CES 2017 press conference, it made good on  a tease from last week and announced a whole new fleet of robohelpers for the smart home, including one that'll mow your lawn.

Like  other lawn bots we've seen, LG's robomower looks a lot like a robot vacuum built for the outdoors, although it's significantly larger than an automated house cleaner. Presumably, it'll use sensors to track its way around your yard and then back to its charging dock. Hopefully, it includes some sort of protection against someone picking it up and running off with it.

Details on its features and capabilities are pretty scant right now -- the gadget only got about a sentence or two's worth of stage time. We'll track it down here in Las Vegas and update this post once we have more information to share."
LG's new Hub Robot ties together the smart home|"

The LG Smart Hub Robot is a long way from showing up in your home. This newly announced gadget is another in the long line of CES 2017 robot companions, but unlike many others, it has a tech giant behind its development.

While that might mean it's final form is more likely to be good, it also means we might not see the little guy come out for quite some time -- perhaps years. LG gave no information regarding an expected release date or pricing.

For now, the LG Hub Robot seems to rely at least partially on Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for skills like playing music and alerting users to weather conditions. But by the time the machine makes it to market, it's just as likely to be running on its own proprietary voice tech.

What's certain now is that it will connect LG's smart appliances around the house, like the oven, robot vacuum cleaner and washing machines. As it spends more time with users, it should learn their patterns and adjust its use of these appliances accordingly.

In addition, the LG Hub Robot features a circular ""face"" with a screen displaying eyes -- perched atop a softly conical white body. The robot can re-orient itself to face the user and bob along with music it's playing, but it's otherwise stationary. The screen can also display images and videos using some sort of basic web browser.

LG has teased the Hub Robot before, and also announced other home appliances at the press conference, including a smart fridge featuring Alexa and a robot lawnmower."
Tire your kids out and teach them with Fisher-Price's new gadget|"

The little balls of energy we call preschoolers spend most days wearing themselves and their parents out. Especially today, when so many parents work full- or part-time, knowing how to give young children attention, instruction, and just basic necessities like food and medical attention can be overwhelming.

Enter Fisher-Price's newest device: the Fisher-Price Think and Learn Smart Cycle. The Smart Cycle aims to give kids an outlet for that extra energy -- but also instruction for their expanding intellects. At $150 (converts to roughly AU$200, ‎£120), the Cycle will connect via Bluetooth to tablets or TVs, and offer learning apps that focus on math, science, STEM, literacy, and social studies.

While I don't love the idea of adding another reason to stare at screens in the homes of today's children, Fisher-Price's device looks interesting. It certainly could supplement the time beleaguered parents are already logging everyday, offering an alternative to TV programs that fail to teach or get kids moving.

The Smart Cycle also offers cool ways for parents to track their child's progress through the learning courses. A Bluetooth-connected app allows monitoring over time.

My concerns about the Smart Cycle as a parent are twofold: Practically, whether children actually decide to spend time on a stationary bicycle depends heavily on whether the course offerings are engaging. Fisher-Price promises more courses in the coming years, but I wouldn't want to shell out $150 without some evidence of the bike's effectiveness with my own child.

My second concern is more philosophical. I just don't know how helpful early learning is if it doesn't depend on human interaction. The development of foundational critical thinking skills seems especially unlikely if the child has no way to engage the material beyond the strictures laid out by the device. Before I would buy a device like the Smart Cycle, I'd like to see clear empirical evidence from Fisher-Price in support of both learning from a non-human device and from learning while cycling.

At this time, Fisher-Price couldn't offer me that data. So while the Smart Cycle seems compelling in concept, I'd wait to drop $150 until I saw real numbers that support its use."
Ooma's Home Monitoring System will call 911 for you|"

As you might expect of a smart home system, Ooma's sensors will notify you if they detect something out of the ordinary. The sensors won't just notify you, though. Ooma's motion detector, water detector, or door and window sensor can each call 911 themselves.

Ooma made a name for itself with the Telo -- a box that plugs into your router and provides you with a home phone service. Telo routes calls over the internet, and you'll need the $90 gadget to make use any of Ooma's new trio of smart home devices.

Introduced at CES today in Las Vegas, Ooma's three sensors -- a $35 motion detector, a $30 leak sensor and a $25 door and window sensor -- communicate with the Telo using Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication. DECT is the same tech used by ordinary cordless telephones.

You can set the sensors to Home or Away mode and if they detect something amiss, they'll alert you by phone, push notifications, email or text messages depending on your preferences. The sensors can also call 911 directly from your Telo. It'll connect with the dispatcher closest to your home, and can send through the address as well.

You'll likely need to pay a monthly fee for this service. If you're already using Ooma's premium service for your Telo, you can add as many sensors to your system as you want without adding to your $10 a month fee. If you're using Ooma's free basic service, you can use one sensor for free, but two or more costs $6 a month.

There's no option to use multiple sensors for free and skip the 911 monitoring. That's a shame, but it's also the only thing that makes Ooma's smart home sensors at all unique. The sensors themselves are reasonably priced, so if you already have a Telo, it might make sense to make your home phone smarter."
The Switchmate Power doubles the outlets of competitors|"

Switchmate's first device, a retrofit smart switch release in Summer 2016, wasn't elegant, but it was impressively simple. All you had to do was magnet it over a conventional light switch, and it would add automation to your overhead lights -- no install necessary.

But now Switchmate is getting more ambitious. Not only are they releasing a second generation of the original smart switch barely seven months later -- they're expanding into other areas of the smart home. First up: the Switchmate Power. This is a $40 smart plug that plugs into both outlets in a given fixture, and automates each one separately. With that one design choice, this little startup is already a compelling competitor for industry leaders like Belkin WeMo and iDevices.

The Switchmate Power also has other, well, powers. Not only can you toggle each plug individually, but you can schedule them and automate them using the phone proximity trick of the original Switchmate. Plus, the Power includes two additional USB charging ports for good measure.

In addition, Switchmate integrates with a slew of platforms, notably including both Amazon Echo and Google Home.

From an aesthetic standpoint, the Switchmate Power might not look quite as sharp as, say, the iDevices Switch ($26.50 at Amazon.com). Sleek design has never been Switchmate's strong suit, though; efficiency has. As expected, then, Switchmate's device might turn a wall freckle into a wall wart -- but it'll be a damn powerful wall wart. It even features a backlight to use as a nightlight.

The Switchmate Power will be available February of 2017."
Switchmate hones its successful retrofit switch with Bright at CES 2017|"

In summer 2016, a startup called Switchmate released its first product: A retrofit gadget that fit over the top of a conventional light switch and added automation. It was a refreshingly simple solution to smartening up wired lights at home -- but it also came with its share of limitations.

Now Switchmate is releasing its second-generation smart switch, the Switchmate Bright. At $40, it's a little more expensive than the original device (which will stay on the market at $30), but still cheaper than most in-wall switches. And it comes with a bunch of cool design upgrades.

Switchmate has always distinguished itself with ease of install. You simply affix the device overtop a light switch using its magnetic base, and it's pretty much ready to use. The app allows users to toggle the device, which physically flips the switch on and off.

The Switchmate Bright features a slimmer design than the original device, so you can fit multiple onto a panel of switches. This makes the Bright a much more compelling device for more comprehensive setups, although I'd still like to see a multi-switch version soon.

The Bright also includes a motion detector, so it can automatically switch on or off when it senses a user walking into the room. Again, this broadens the appeal of the Switchmate, which originally could automate using only timers or Bluetooth to respond to the proximity of a phone.

Finally, Switchmate's strength seems to be rising as it partners with more developers -- particularly Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) and Google Home.

Switchmate plans to begin shipping the Bright by February 2017."
Cut those long showers short and save some water with the Hydrao First|"

A series of Bluetooth-connected showerheads will give you a light display when it's time to cut your long shower short. The Hydrao showerheads, which were on display at CES in Las Vegas on Tuesday night, have built-in LED lights that change from green to blue to purple to red based on how much water you've used. Smart and Blue, the French company that created the showerheads, wants you to use the light as a visual cue to take shorter showers to reduce your water and energy bills.

The Hydrao First is available for preorder in the US (it's previously been available in France) for $99, which converts to AU$140, £80. Two other models -- the $99 Hydrao Drop that fits onto existing showerheads, and the higher end, $160 (AU$220, £130) Hydrao Loop -- will be available later in 2017.

The Hydrao will also work with Alexa, Amazon's voice-activated digital assistant. It's a fairly limited integration -- you can only ask Alexa how much water you've used and how much money you've saved on your water and energy bills (if you do shorten those showers, that is).

You can use the Hydrao's app to adjust the amount of water that will trigger each color. If you leave the default settings and reduce the length of your showers, a family of four can save about $200 a year on utility bills, said Eric Burkel, who leads international strategy and development with Smart and Blue. If that turns out to be true, the Hydrao First will pay for itself in a year -- and then some."
Netatmo takes a shot at a HomeKit smoke detector|"

Can Siri finally find a smoke detector to take on the Nest Protect? The Netatmo Smart Smoke Alarm hopes to be that detector, has all the features you'd expect: an app with remote notifications, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. You can silence the alarm over Bluetooth, though not over Wi-Fi as a ""safety feature.""

I found Siri's voice controls disappointing in the OneLink Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm, and the Netatmo won't add any extra options. You can ask Siri to check on the status of the alarm. I'd hope that if the alarm was sounding, you wouldn't have to ask.

Lackluster voice controls aside, the OneLink alarm was disappointing in more ways than one, so the Netatmo detector could still be worth it for HomeKit fans if its push notifications are snappier. I'd like to be able to silence the alarm from anywhere, but I understand limiting that functionality to Bluetooth's range. The Alarm comes with a battery that's supposed to last 10 years.

Netatmo's newest smart safety product will be available to purchase later this year. It's on display at CES, though Netatmo wasn't yet ready to confirm a price. A rep did say it would be ""under $100.""

Along with the Smart Smoke Alarm, Netatmo also showed off a new Siren that'll work with the company's Netatmo Welcome Cam. The Welcome recognizes faces, and you can set the alarm to start ringing if it sees a stranger. The Siren's also due out later this year with an unspecified price ""under $100."""
Bloomlife comes close to exploiting anxieties of pregnant women|"

Complications during pregnancy happen for a surprising number of women, and a new startup called Bloomlife has a solution: a wearable monitor that helps women tell the difference between normal abdominal aches and pains, natural contractions, and signs of complications.

In theory, I like Bloomlife. It's a device that won't help most women -- but it could give the minority who encounter complications the confidence to either relax or seek proper attention. There are two problems with the actual product, though. First, its monthly fees for the monitoring are overpriced: The first month is $150, the second is $100, and subsequent months are $50. Second, Bloomlife doesn't have the FDA certification of a medical device.

The price problem is the biggest one, simply because most women won't really need Bloomlife. Contractions are a natural step toward delivery, and few women experience them without knowing what they are, or don't notice them. So paying upwards of $300, depending when you start monitoring the pregnancy, seems unnecessary -- especially at a stage of life that is far more financially demanding than most others.

The problem of reliability, by contrast, might not affect as many users, but it could dramatically affect a few. Bloomlife does rely on longitudinal data, gathered over time from the user, so the information it offers is valid. And even with that data, it doesn't purport to offer diagnoses. But users will naturally look to a device like Bloomlife for actionable advice, and without proper third-party testing, it simply isn't equipped to provide such advice.

Bloomlife is available for order now."
WooHoo rolls every smart home product ever into one AI helper|"

At CES 2017, a SmartBeings rep called WooHoo ""an Amazon Echo combined with a Nest Cam, combined with a touchscreen."" That's an impressive description, and it doesn't even account for lots of other features. WooHoo has facial recognition and voice recognition. WooHoo's head has motion detection and spins all the way around. WooHoo also works as a smart home hub.

WooHoo's goal: conquer the smart home. You'll be able to use it as a security cam, and the touchscreen has Android built in and lets you make video calls. In will connect to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave and more. It'll even have a cellular signal and a battery backup.

As for its Echo-like functionality, it'll listen for a wake word, like the Echo, and you'll be able to command WooHoo to control your smart home. Since it can recognize your face and your voice, you can even create personalized commands.

SmartBeings reps didn't offer any confirmed smart home partnerships at CES, and the device itself is still very much a prototype. That's understandable -- it's still being crowdfunded on Kickstarter. But I'm still worried. Face recognition is a tough technology to get right, as is voice recognition, and so is voice assistance generally.

WooHoo aims to do everything, but that won't be worth much if its not as good as the Echo or the Nest, or anything else at any one task. Commendably, the preorder price is enticingly low -- $50 (converts to AU$70, £40) on Kickstarter or the company's site. But you'll need to pay a monthly fee to take advantage of all of the services. That makes sense, given the cellular connection, but it's still an ongoing cost not shared by the many devices it's combining.

SmartBeings has ambitiously set summer as a release goal. I'd like to believe WooHoo will be able to hit on all of its promises -- it would be an amazing device if so -- but the SmartBeings team still has a long, difficult road to get to that all-in-one promised land."
Memoo teaches Alexa how to be kid-friendly|"

Any parent of young children knows the extra layer of consideration required before buying a digital assistant -- do I really want to put up with my kid asking Google to play that ""Raining Tacos"" song on YouTube every five minutes?

C-Way, a new kid-tech startup, offers an out: Memoo, a device that houses Amazon's Alexa, but includes parental controls and extra kid-friendly features. Problem is, Memoo costs $175 (AU$240, £140) -- nearly four times the price of an Echo Dot.

Here's how Memoo works. First, parents connect the device to an app on their phone, from which they can send voice messages, set basic alarms and set up daily agendas to be read aloud each morning.

In addition, kids can access games, music, and info on the internet -- all via voice commands. Using pictograms and colors, Memoo will also indicate how the weather outside is, so kids can dress accordingly, and at night, Memoo can trigger connected humidifiers and thermostats.

Memoo also lets users access Amazon's parental controls for Alexa. Parents can approve Spotify playlists for their children, limit Wi-Fi access to certain hours and choose particular family members for the kids to be able to contact via voice message through the app.

C-Way's idea isn't a bad one. The problem is, Memoo seems to go a long way to supplant the day-to-day interactions that characterize parent-child relationships. It's those small interactions, like waking up a child in the morning or reminding them to grab their lunch on the way out the door, that define parenthood. And while Memoo might appear to be an expedient solution to everyday issues in parenting, my question is, since when is expedience such a priority in caring for a child?

C-Way plans to make Memoo available in Fall 2017."
Sensorwake's bedside Oria improves sleep using aroma|"

Who knew you felt tired all the time because your room didn't smell good enough? A company called Sensorwake, apparently. Oria, its new $150 bedside device (roughly converted to £122 or AU$207) going on sale in summer 2017, patented scents around users' rooms to help them fall asleep faster, and sleep more deeply. Whether it actually accomplishes that purpose remains to be seen.

For now, Oria is a pretty one-dimensional product. It is connected to Wi-Fi, so integration with other platforms is a possibility for the future, but nothing is concrete yet. But it is special in one way: It holds a receptacle for recyclable scent capsules (each lasting about two months with daily use), and a fan for dispersing their aromatic contents around the immediate vicinity of the user.

Sensorwake's two patented scents are designed specifically to help users get to sleep faster, and stay in deep sleep more consistently. The company's in-house specialists and business partners cite their own research indicating Oria gets users 40% better sleep. Without third-party corroboration, however, it's impossible to gauge how beneficial the device will actually be.

Even Sensorwake acknowledges aroma is inextricably linked to memory, making it practically impossible to design a device of this sort with broad appeal. Its detailed descriptions of its scents (""powdered rose, peach and pear, with notes of talc and musk"") certainly sound appealing, but not necessarily effective for all users.

Despite my skepticism, though, Oria will likely work at least on an atmospheric level -- much like scented candles and incense. The only problem is, most candles and incenses don't cost $150."
Luke Roberts Smart Lamp 'paints' light in any direction you like|"

It seems like color-changing smart lights are everywhere you look at CES, but a $700 hanging lamp from an Austrian startup I've never heard of before still managed to catch my eye.

That Vienna-based startup is named Luke Roberts, and its smart lamp is called, fittingly enough, the Luke Roberts Smart Lamp (it was originally called ""Fluxo,"" but it hit a trademark issue shortly before launch). It's  an Indiegogo success that lets you cast light of any color in any direction by picking a shade in the companion app, then swiping your finger across your phone's screen like a paint brush.

Though it isn't cheap, it's a pretty impressive product with plenty of color-changing horsepower. Inside are over 300 light-emitting diodes -- for comparison, a color-changing  Philips Hue LED only has a few dozen. The lamp's co-creators, Lukas Pilat and Robert Kopka (get it?) claim that it will put out 2,000 lumens of full-color light above the fixture, and another 3,000 lumens of white light that gets cast downward.

You can pick and choose where that light goes, too. If you only want light in one spot of the room, just swipe in that direction on your phone. If you want red light on one side of the room and blue light on the other side, you can do that, too.

The obvious question is whether or not this lamp will work with any larger smart home platforms, especially since it's meant to play such a central role in your home. The lamp uses Bluetooth LE to connect with your phone, which limits its range, but that wouldn't keep it from connecting to a Bluetooth-compatible hub.

Compatibility with Apple HomeKit is another possibility. HomeKit is the set of smart home protocols built into iPhones and iPads, and compatible devices enjoy native, unified controls in Apple's Home app, along with Siri voice controls. HomeKit already has a couple of Bluetooth gadgets to its name (and can even use Apple TV to extend their range outside of the home), and it's already been shown to work especially well with color-changing lights like  Philips Hue and Nanoleaf Aurora. It's this lamp's optimal landing spot.

Still, I want to see it finish shipping out to its surplus of backers, first. The lamp's creators tell me that they're on track to meet that goal in March. Until then, units are available for preorder at a discounted price that comes out to about $500 (or £410/AU$690, converted roughly)."
Olly is the home robot pal who will grow to be just like you|"

There are smart home hubs and there are smart home robots, but where does the dividing line fall?

The key is a combination of personality, movement and interaction, according to Hongbin Zhuang, the London-based founder of social robot Olly.

Pointing to two Olly robots sitting side by side in Emotech's booth at CES Unveiled, Zhuang explains that where one Olly is whizzing around energetically responding to anyone and everyone who engages with it, its neighbour is more calm and reserved -- it only speaks when spoken to.

This is the result of the robot's deep-learning capabilities that mean as your Olly gets to know you and your daily routines over time, it will evolve to become more like you and respond to the patterns of your life.

When it comes to what the robot can actually do, it is similar to Amazon's Echo or Google Home ($129.00 at Jet.com). It can respond to your questions by looking up information for you, and can control all of your smart devices and internet-connected products you may have around your home. Where it differs from its rivals is in its ability to be proactive. It could predict whether you might want to listen to music when you get home from work for example, as well as what you might like that music to be.

The original prototype of Emotech's robot featured a single eye, but testing suggested that while some users loved this feature, others did not. Now, Olly is a black donut that rises to greet you when you wake it and swivels to face you when you address it. It responds not just with voice, but with mesmeric light patterns that help it express itself.

The Olly we encountered at CES was still in prototype format, but following further user testing this spring, it should be available to buy later this year."
Brew your own way with PicoBrew Freestyle|"

PicoBrew's PicoPaks just became fully customizable. On display at CES 2017, the PicoBrew Freestyle lets you make a beer exactly to your liking with a few clicks.

PicoPaks are the prepackaged ingredients that work with the push-button brewer -- the $800 (converts to roughly $1,100, £650) PicoBrew Pico. Previously, you picked your PicoPak from a list of professionally crafted microbrews. If you think you can do better, now you can.

The PicoBrew Freestyle allows you to make full use of its online interface to select all of your beer's ingredients -- the hops, the malt, even the yeast -- then the company will ship you your selection, complete with a customized name.

I spent some time with the system at CES, and Freestyle is delightfully intuitive to use.

You start by picking a base type of beer, you have six options ranging from stout to hoppy IPA. Then, Pico will offer suggestions at each of the next phases, but you can drag and drop various grains and hops to your heart's desire and completely change the character of your beer. Better yet, as you make changes, the stats of the beer listed at the top of the page change too. You'll see the beer's color, bitterness and alcohol level, and all of them alter actively as you tinker, as does the price of the Pak.

PicoBrew obviously limits you to the types of malt and hops they have in stock, but they have a decent selection. The site will also stop you if you try to push the recipe past what the Pico can handle, but you still have a wide range of wiggle room.

The only concern I have with the PicoBrew Freestyle is strangely the Pico itself. We're putting it through its paces for a review, and it hasn't impressed me yet. If the Pico ends up winning me over, the Freestyle will be an awesome feature that's available now and free for PicoBrew's customers."
At CES 2017, Carrier Cor 5C wants to be the next Nest thermostat|"

Carrier makes everything from home HVAC systems to humidifiers, but the company is perhaps best known for its line of thermostats. And today, Carrier is adding to its lineup with two new smart thermostats, the Cor 5C and 7C.

Like competitors from Honeywell, Ecobee and Nest, the Cor 5C and 7C have advanced controls that make them a bit smarter than your average heat and A/C controller. Here's a rundown of what Cor's new thermostats are supposed to do:

While Carrier hasn't shared specific pricing or availability information for its Cor 5C and 7C thermostat just yet, the team said it's striving to reach a broader audience with these products. Hopefully, that means lower prices.

We've seen this trend lately with Carrier's competitors. Both Ecobee and Honeywell have introduced lower-priced, sub-$200 smart thermostats within the last year in the Ecobee3 Lite and the Honeywell Lyric T5 (video below). Carrier's new thermostats actually look a lot like Lyric T5. Nest, on the other hand, still sells a single thermostat model for the same price as always -- $249 (£249, not yet available in Australia).

Maybe Cor's pricing will help it appeal on the same level as Ecobee and Honeywell's latest models. We'll just have to wait and see.

D-Link HD Wi-Fi Camera is so crazy cheap it might just be worth it|"

D-Link's making it easier to enter the smart home. The company's newest security camera, introduced this week at CES in Las Vegas, costs just $70. A D-Link rep suggested the price could be even lower by the time the camera goes on sale this spring.

As a smart-home device that's priced more like a splurge than an investment, the $70 DCS-8000 LH still has night vision, sound and motion detection, a built-in microphone and a 120-degree field of view. You'll be able to view live footage from the cam with the myDLink Home app for iOS and Android.

By the time the camera hits stores, D-Link will be rolling out new features for the app as well.

The online storage is important, as the $70 cam offers no SD card slot for local storage. D-Link also introduced a $120 model with two-way audio, a 180-degree field of view, and an SD card slot -- the DCS-8100LH if you want local storage.

It's been awhile since we've loved a D-Link smart-home cam, but a $70 connected model could be a steal if it's competent.

Withings Home Plus is a next-gen security camera with HomeKit in its sights|"

I reviewed the Withings Home back in 2015 (video below). At $200, £150 or AU$275, this do-it-yourself security camera had a lot of competitive features -- 1080p high-definition video resolution, live streaming, motion detection capabilities. It even had additional sensors for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air.

But the Home didn't offer an Android app or a web interface when I tested it. You also couldn't save recorded video clips.

Flash forward to today and Withings is back with a second-gen version of the Home, the Home Plus. Replacing Withings' original security camera offering, the $200 Home Plus actually has a lot of the same features. But this time there's an Android version of the Withings Home ($149.98 at Amazon.com) app, as well as a 24-hour timelapse of activity, a two-day event log and optional continuous video recording for a monthly fee.

The Home Plus also works with Apple's smart home platform, HomeKit. That means you can pair your device to Apple's Home app for iOS devices. You can also use your Apple Watch or Apple TV to view your camera's live feed. While there aren't many voice commands that work with the Home Plus, you can ask Siri to adjust the color of the night light LEDs in the camera's base.

The Home Plus also isn't the first security camera to announce upcoming compatibility with HomeKit. Both August and Kuna announced plans to work with the smart home platform back in July. Withings' Home Plus is expected to hit stores in early 2017 -- stay tuned for the full review.

Keratase Hair Coach is a smart hairbrush that tells you if your locks are in good shape|"

We've written about connected frying pans, makeup mirrors that work with Amazon Alexa and app-enabled food composters, but smart hair care products are an entirely new frontier. Today we explore that uncharted territory with the Kerastase Hair Coach Powered by Withings.

Yes, the Hair Coach is essentially just a brush, but this version was dreamed up by the L'Oreal-owned hair care brand Kerastase in partnership with smart home company Withings. That means you can expect this quirky device to do a bit more than your typical hairbrush.

Pricing hasn't been announced for the Hair Coach just yet, but  it will cost less than $200 (£160 or AU$275 converted) when it hits stores mid-2017.

The Hair Coach is supposed to send the information it gathers to the related app over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The app should then factor in environmental conditions, such as the temperature, humidity, UV index and more to give you a hair quality score, details on how well you're brushing your hair and tips on how to improve. The app is also supposed to give you product suggestions -- Kerastase-brand-specific, of course.

I'm pretty skeptical about this gadget. I don't think I need this much help brushing my hair, but I'm also very curious what reading it would give me. I guess I'll just have to try it out to see.

Somfy One steps out from smart shades to tackle home security|"

Motorized shade company Somfy has decided to enter the DIY home security fray with an all-in-one device dubbed the Somfy One. Somfy's inaugural home security product follows the company's 2016 acquisition of security startup Myfox, whose tech-centric but pricey DIY system we reviewed in 2015.

Here's an overview of the $229 (£185 or AU$320 converted) Somfy One's core features:

Up until this point, startups have been the brains behind all-in-one DIY security systems. The Piper Classic, the Piper NV and their closest competitor, the Canary Smart Home Security Device, all got started on crowdfunding sites. Like Somfy One, all of them have offered high-definition cameras with built-in sirens and additional security features that go beyond your typical HD cam.

But the Somfy One seems to offer a few more options than its counterparts. In addition to the IntelliTag door and window sensor accessories that use  vibration detection to differentiate between a knock and a forced entry (a carryover feature from Myfox), neither Piper nor Canary systems support professional monitoring. The Somfy One is also supposed to work with Amazon Alexa, IFTTT and Nest at launch.

If Somfy decides to integrate the Somfy One with its line of connected shades and other products, this motorized shade company could become a surprise contender in the smart home security market.

Even the garbage cans are smart at CES|"

It was only a matter of time before our trash bins got brains. The GeniCan is a Wi-Fi-enabled attachment for your garbage cans that will respond to voice commands, scan barcodes to build your grocery list and automatically order items you need through Amazon's Dash Replenishment service. The GeniCan company will demonstrate the device this week at CES in Las Vegas.

You can preorder the GeniCan now for $125, or about £100/AU$170 (the full retail price will be $149, or roughly £120/AU$200), and the company aims to begin shipping them in early 2017.

The GeniCan attaches to the side of most rectangular garbage cans (or recycling bins, if that's your fancy). Before you toss your empty box of Frosted Flakes, you hold the bar code up to the GeniCan, and it will automatically add ""Frosted Flakes"" to a grocery list in your GeniCan iOS or Android app. If the GeniCan can't find a bar code, you can use voice commands to tell the device what you want to add to your list. Order a lot of your household items from Amazon? Once you register for the Amazon Dash Replenishment service, anything that the GeniCan scans that's available through Amazon will ship automatically. Imagine: you throw out an empty diaper box, and another one is automatically on the way.

We first learned about GeniCan during its 2015 Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign. The company surpassed its funding goal and raised a little more than $7,800 to help create this product. The hard part will be to convince you to literally throw $149 into your trash."
Mattel Aristotle is an Amazon Echo that understands your kids, too|"

It's a baby monitor. It's a voice-activated smart assistant. It answers your questions, and maybe your kids' questions, too. It orders more diapers when you run out and soothes babies back to sleep automatically. It plays with your kids. It could be the most exciting thing toymaker Mattel has ever produced.

It's called the Aristotle, and it's not just an Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) clone: the device is a fully functioning Amazon Alexa assistant that can answer all the same adult questions and has all the same smart-home capabilities -- but if you say ""Aristotle"" instead of ""Alexa,"" it will summon a different voice assistant designed to interact with your kids.

The voice-activated speaker also comes with a wireless camera that streams 256-bit encrypted video to your phone, an array of colorful LEDs and special software, some of which -- as a new parent myself -- sounds too good to be true.

Here are some of the additional things that Mattel claims the Aristotle's software does:

Interestingly, Mattel says that Microsoft's (not Amazon's) cloud services  are doing a lot of the heavy lifting -- it will use Bing search to answer parenting questions and both Microsoft Cognitive Services and ""Cortana Intelligence"" to do AI-like things. On the smart-home side, Mattel says it's compatible with Wink, Wemo, Smart Things, Philips Hue, ZigBee and IFTTT among others.

In my brief time watching Aristotle work, I was impressed by some of the creative integrations its designers thought up. For instance, if a parent left some chores for a child to finish before TV time, Aristotle will ask the child to finish up before turning on the television. If the kiddo is wearing one of Mattel's location-tracking wristbands, Aristotle will wait for the child to actually go do the chore before it will comply with requests.

The most interesting part about Aristotle isn't just the list of features; it's the cohesiveness of the device. It substitutes for multiple devices in a baby nursery -- like a white-noise emitter, monitor and night-light. It also offers goodies for kids once they move to the next stage of development, like stories, games and educational lessons. These features, along with the solid smart-home control, make it a device that could conceivably ""grow up"" alongside your child.

Now, whether a child growing up alongside a digital assistant is a good or bad thing is a separate question -- and one Aristotle's developers were reticent about. Aristotle isn't supposed to parent, Senior Manager of Marketing and Communication Lisa Lee explained, but rather to offer tools to make parents' jobs easier. That's why Mattel won't be following up with research on the effects on children of interacting with digital assistants from a young age. Voice assistants are entering households anyway, and Lee says they want to offer something that more critically thinks about engaging the children in those homes.

The device should ship in June 2017 for about $300 (this roughly converts to £245 or AU$415). That's not cheap, but it could be a small price to pay for a device that offers so many different services.

And if you don't have kids, keep in mind that Lenovo also just introduced a $129 Amazon Echo derivative (£105 or AU$179, converted) that could have a much better speaker.

Update, January 4 at 11:09 a.m. PT: Mattel claims the Aristotle can do even more things than we originally heard. We've added the full list above.

Automatically recognizes when babies wake up, and soothes them to sleep with a lullaby, white noise, a favorite song or a night-light.Logs wet diapers and feedings via voice commands or a phone app.Automatically orders more diapers or formula from Target, Babies R Us and other participating retailers.Automatically looks for deals and coupons on consumable baby supplies.Actually recognizes and answers young kids' questions after a brief voice recognition training sessionAnswers questions until your child falls asleep.Plays guessing games with kids based on animal noises (say the name of the animal) or shapes held up to the camera (say the name of the shape), then lights up with the correct answer.Reads aloud from a selection of dozens of children's books, accompanying them with sound and light effects that match the stories.Hosts sing-alongs and teaches ABCs and 1-2-3s.Recognizes specially designed kids' toys with embedded NFC chips, or with its camera, and provides sound effects when kids play with them (an upcoming Hot Wheels racetrack was one example).Optionally requires kids to say ""Please"" when they ask Aristotle for things, to help teach manners.Helps kids with homework.Gives foreign-language lessons. (Mattel says this is targeted at tweens, not younger children.)"
First Alert Onelink Environment Monitor brings Alexa and Siri into your child's bedroom|"

First Alert's Environment Monitor wants to keep your child safe and comfortable. It monitors temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide and connects to your Wi-Fi network so you can check on any of the three via the First Alert Onelink app when you're out and about. Now, you can even check on your child's room with your voice.

With a new integration with Amazon's assistant Alexa, you'll be able to ask your Echo to tell you the status of your child's room. Alexa will be able to tell you about any of the three criteria the First Alert device measures.

Available now for $100 on First Alert's site, the Monitor's Alexa integration should launch soon. First Alert is showing off the device as part of its CES lineup, even though the Monitor itself is already on the market. It currently works with Apple HomeKit's Siri.

Hopefully, its readings and alerts are more responsive and useful than the disappointing Onelink Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm."
New iDevices Instant Switch on-wall light switch makes convenience king|"

Over the past few years, iDevices has slowly been expanding its roster of smart home devices -- from smart plugs, to a thermostat ($110.99 at Amazon.com), an in-wall switch and an outlet. Now it's adding a device to draw them all together: the iDevices Instant Switch.

Unlike every other iDevices product, the Instant Switch doesn't use Wi-Fi to communicate with users via their phones. Instead, it uses Bluetooth to pair with any other iDevices power device (such as its plugs and switches) and inject a little more control to them. And at $50, the Instant Switch fits right in with the pricing of the other iDevices products -- which is exactly the problem.

The Instant Switch basically works like this: you stick it to a wall (using included Command adhesive strips on the back), pair it with another iDevices gadget and use it to control that gadget. That could mean, for instance, sticking the Instant Switch beside your bed, connecting it to a lamp via the iDevices Switch and just punching it from bed whenever you're ready to sleep.

Or if you have a more elaborate setup, the Instant Switch could control multiple products at once, turning off in-wall switches, outlets and plugs all in concert.

I like the usability of iDevices' latest product. As someone who's wasted countless hours on cumbersome smart home device installations, I appreciate the effort to streamline the experience. But the features offered by the Instant Switch seem a bit anemic.

First off, its convenience comes at the cost of independence: you can only use the Instant Switch as intended if you already have iDevices products. That immediately limits the audience. Plus, that convenience isn't new: you can control the Instant Switch and other iDevices gadgets with Siri or Alexa, so as long as you have your phone, you can control the lights from anywhere already.

Secondly, the Instant Switch doesn't integrate with other non-power devices -- not even iDevices' own Thermostat. That makes it far less appealing than, say, Lutron's in-wall switches, which can integrate with platforms like IFTTT to perform much more complex tasks, or the Belkin WeMo in-wall switch, which also integrates with more devices and still clocks in at the same $50 price as the Instant Switch.

Unless the Instant Switch drops its projected $50 price to something that better reflects its feature set among the competition, it amounts to little more than an interesting failure. Here's hoping when it becomes available in summer 2017 that it will boast more features or a more appropriate price."
Cold feet in bed? Sleep Number 360 Smart Bed has you covered at CES 2017|"

Sleep Number is doing its part to combat frosty toes with its new 360 Smart Bed. Yes, the 360 actually has built-in tech that warms the foot of the bed for you as you're falling asleep so both you and your partner can slumber more comfortably.

In addition to its foot-warming capabilities, the 360 Smart Bed also claims a couple of other advanced features:

Of course, the 360 Smart Bed also comes with the same SleepIQ app for Android or iPhone as the company's It Bed. That means you'll still be able to change the firmness settings of your  mattress yourself, check how well you slept the night before and how well you have been sleeping for the past week and month.

As part of SleepIQ's software, you can also integrate the 360 Smart Bed with products from Nest, Fitbit and other manufacturers. I got the chance to test out this functionality over six weeks of sleeping on the It Bed. While it was easy to pair partnering products to the bed, the integrations didn't help me improve my sleep.

But Sleep Number has introduced a lot of updates and new features since I started testing the It Bed in the fall. Not only can SleepIQ now differentiate between when you're in bed but awake and when you're asleep, it now offers even more personalization. Here's an example straight from Sleep Number's official 360 Smart Bed press release:

This all sounds pretty good, but we won't know exactly how well it works until we get our hands on a 360 Smart Bed. Sleep Number plans to introduce 360 beds in stages throughout the year. While the team hasn't yet shared pricing information, Sleep Number will offer a variety of mattress and bases and expects their cost to be close to the brand's existing products.

Snore-no-more: Sleep Number says its 360 bed reads biometric cues to find out if someone's snoring. If they are, the dual-sided adjustable bed is designed to raise just the snorer's head to reduce the sound.Self-adjusting mattress: According to Sleep Number, your ideal mattress settings change based on your sleep position. So, if you happen to switch from your back to your side midsleep, SleepIQ software should notice and deflate the mattress slightly to optimize your comfort.

ConnectSense brings Siri to the corners of your home|"

With the ConnectSense Bluetooth Extender, shown off in CES at Las Vegas this week, you'll be able to install smart home devices in the far corners of your home without worrying about being out of range. The Extender will send the signal of devices that communicate through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the cloud, allowing you to control those devices while on the go.

BLE allows sensors that don't need a lot of power to function for years without needing a battery swap. The biggest drawback of BLE is you have to be nearby (usually in the same room or an adjacent one) to control a Bluetooth device with your phone. The Extender looks to fix that problem.

ConnectSense's device will work with Apple's HomeKit, though unfortunately it won't double as a hub for Apple's smart home software. You'll still need an Apple TV or an iPad if you want to use Siri to control your smart home from the road.

The $40 to $50 sensor (the exact price hasn't been finalized) will be available this Spring, and likely works best in conjunction with an Apple TV or iPad. If you have a big place, you could put one Apple TV in the main room and use the Extender as a bridge to your sensors in the basement.

Along with the Extender, ConnectSense will be showing off two new HomeKit sensors at CES this week:

Both will work with Bluetooth and run on three AAA batteries. You'll be able to buy the Extender and both sensors in a pack for $100 (converts to roughly £80, AU$140) later this year.

Kuri is a robot nanny that charms the kids and watches your place|"

With Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, a 1080p cam and sturdy wheels designed to traverse any interior flooring, Kuri has a lot going for it. What I first noticed, though, were the eyes. For better or for worse, every inch of Kuri looks to be designed with the goal of making this robot helper adorable.

At first, I thought Kuri would be a bit like an Amazon Echo strapped to a set of wheels. In practice, Kuri doesn't have nearly the functionality of the Echo -- it's more of a roving security cam with a bluetooth speaker than an always-listening, multi-purpose assistant. Kuri's advantage is its personality. Its wordless chirps and nods remind me of a Pixar character, and Kuri was clearly designed to please the younger members of your family while it helps you patrol the halls and keep an eye on your home.

On display at CES, Kuri -- created by the Bosch-backed startup Mayfield Robotics -- will be able to use its camera to check on your pets when you're away. It can set reminders and use its Wi-Fi connection to tell you about the weather. It'll also work with IFTTT, the online rule-maker with a ton of smart home partners, to control some connected devices.

Supposedly, Kuri can also recognize faces and context and adapt its responses accordingly. Those responses include chirps and nods, since Kuri doesn't talk, though it will play podcast, music and tell stories. It also has LEDs built into its chest that can change colors.

After spending some time with Kuri in person, I can confirm that it's instantly likable. The way it smiles with its eyes is cute, though I had some trouble getting it to respond to me when I said ""Hey Kuri."" Weirdly, it responded just fine when I said ""Hey"" near it in another context, but the voice recognition still needs some polish by the time it ships in December 2017.

The Kuri team has work to do in the coming year, as Kuri wasn't yet ready to follow me autonomously or ready to do anything else via voice command other than chirp. Kuri does successfully navigate from room to room now, remembering where rooms are once you guide it there using the remote control in the app. It also successfully navigates around objects in its path using a laser sensor.

Here's everything else we know about Kuri so far:

By the time it launches, Kuri will supposedly be able to follow a routine based on who it recognizes. It can send you a custom notification if it spots your dog on the couch, so you can yell at Fido using Kuri's speakers. Kuri can patrol your home using a predetermined route, letting you know if it spots something out of the ordinary, and it can use its motion and sound detection to hunt down an unusual occurrence and send you a recording.

All of that sounds cool, but Kuri will cost a hefty $700. Starting today, you can preorder Kuri for a $100 deposit. Kuri will only be available in the US when it launches, but its price converts to around £570 or AU$975. For that much, Kuri will need to be more than a security camera that doubles as a toy. I'd particularly hope for more smart home integration and more options for voice commands.

It'll have an iOS and Android appIt has three hours of battery lifeA four-microphone array helps it hear your voice commandsIt's 20 inches tall and 14 pounds, so it won't be easy to lug it to different floorsKuri's sensors help it map rooms and objects and avoid falling over edges"
Alexa with better audio? CES introduces the Lenovo Smart Assistant|"

Amazon's Echo is the current standard for smart home assistants -- with some new competition from Google Home, of course -- thanks to its ease of use and surprisingly good voice-controlled personality, named Alexa.

But while the Echo (and the Echo Dot and Tap) are Amazon-made products, Alexa herself is slipping the bonds of corporate exclusivity and turning up in a handful of other products. We've already seen the Triby smart radio: Now Lenovo has the Smart Assistant.

It's not a very catchy name, but one look will tell you this is clearly modeled on the Echo. It's a tall cylindrical device, but with a warmer design than Amazon's severe speaker. The top half is white, with a silver 360-degree microphone-speaker combo on top. The bottom half feels more like the Google Home device, with a gray, green or orange woven overlay for a splash of color. Inside is an Intel Celeron N3060 processor, and one 5-watt tweeter and one 10-watt woofer for audio.

It looks like an Echo, it uses Alexa, it uses the official Alexa phone app, and works with the same wide range of third-party smart home devices. So, design aside, what exactly is the difference between the Lenovo Smart Assistant and an Echo? Lenovo says it's the one area the Echo is often criticized for coming up short -- sound. There's a standard model Smart Assistant, and for $50 more, there's a special Harman Kardon edition with premium audio.

We'll have to wait for a serious ears-on test to find out if it makes a real difference, but matching Alexa with a good quality built-in speaker could be a killer combo.

Also new in Lenovo's smart home line is the Smart Storage box, a networked hard drive with 6TB of storage, dual-band wireless and built-in facial recognition software to help identify your photos.

The Lenovo Smart Assistant starts at $129 in the US (£105 or AU$179 converted) for the standard edition, which is less than the standard Echo. The Harman Kardon edition will be $179 (£145 or AU$195), and both will be available in May. The Smart Storage box starts at $139 in the US (£115 or AU$250), and is also coming in May. UK and Australian availability are yet to be announced; Lenovo usually sells its products in both countries but of the two, Alexa products are currently only available in the UK."
Samsung's two-in-one camera kit covers more ground|"

Samsung today announced the Wisenet-SmartCam A1 Home Security System. Instead of offering a single camera and a variety of related security accessories, this new kit is entirely camera-centric. It includes both an indoor and an outdoor camera.

While the tech giant hasn't shared the price of the system or when exactly it will be available, I'm definitely curious how it stacks up against standalone DIY security cameras.

I've reviewed Samsung's SmartCam HD Pro and SmartCam HD Plus security cameras in the past. Specs for both are roughly comparable to other DIY high-definition cameras on the market, but they both fell short on hardware design and app layout. That's especially true compared to more well-rounded models like the Nest Cam Indoor and the Nest Cam Outdoor.

Here's a quick overview of the Samsung Wisenet-SmartCam A1 Home Security System's specs:

Indoor camera

Outdoor camera

Samsung's outdoor camera certainly seems to be inspired by Netgear's Arlo series of outdoor security products as far as design and specs go, but we'll just have to test it ourselves to be sure. I've reached out to Samsung for the price and retail availability of its new Wisenet-SmartCam A1 Home Security System. Check back soon for updates.

Kwikset Premis HomeKit-enabled Smart Lock review:|"

The premise is simple: Kwikset's been making locks for generations now, and making smart locks for years. Now, it's introducing a smart lock that works with Siri.

It's called the Kwikset Premis, and it's a touchpad deadbolt that works with Apple HomeKit, the smart-home control service built into to Apple's iOS devices. With HomeKit compatibility, you can control and automate the Premis directly from Apple's Home app or from your iPhone's Control Center, alongside other HomeKit-compatible gadgets, and you can lock and unlock it using Siri voice commands, too.

At a retail price of $229, the Premis isn't any less expensive than other popular smart locks, including  	ones from August that also work with HomeKit and Kwikset's own touch-to-open Kevo smart lock, now in its 2nd generation. But it's a very decent smart lock in its own right, boasting a good-looking build, a well-designed app filled with features, and terrific controls for managing multiple users without additional fees. If you're buying in on the Siri-controlled smart home, the Premis is worth consideration.

I like the way this lock looks, but it isn't a groundbreaking design. Essentially, Kwikset just took its existing touchpad smart lock and swapped out the Z-Wave radio for a Bluetooth radio and the necessary HomeKit chipset.

Still, like I said, it's a decent design. Like we've seen with other recent smart locks, the interior housing is a little smaller than past generations, making it less of an eyesore. My only real complaint is that the touchpad is just slightly less responsive than I would like, occasionally requiring an extra stab of my thumb to enter a digit.

I didn't have any trouble installing a Kwikset Premis at the CNET Smart Home, but like with other smart locks, I needed to make sure the door I wanted to smarten up was properly aligned with the latch. Smart locks turn the deadbolt on their own, without help from you. That means that they'll jam if there isn't a smooth path from the door to your door frame. In other words, if you need to push or pull on your doorknob in order to turn your key, that's something you'll need to fix before buying a smart lock like this one.

With that concern in mind, I picked out a particularly well-aligned door in the smart home's mud room and got to work. The Premis doesn't include any installation instructions in the box -- instead, you'll need to download the app for a step-by-step walkthrough. It's definitely helpful, but I would have liked some physical instructions nonetheless.

Still, installation was straightforward, and only took me about twenty minutes or so. All I needed was a screwdriver and some measuring tape. The only steps in addition to what you'd expect from a standard deadbolt are connecting a small cable and inserting four AA batteries, which come included.

With the lock successfully installed, the app did a great job of pairing it with our existing HomeKit setup. Within seconds, I was up and running, both in the Kwikset app and in Apple's Home app. I could lock and unlock the door using both, or by using Siri.

"" data-image-credit=""Ry Crist/CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""kwikset-premis-guest-access.jpg"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""Kwikset Premis guest access"" data-image-filename=""kwikset-premis-guest-access.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2016/12/21"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""1070"" data-image-width=""1214"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox=""enabled"" data-parallax="""">

As cool as those Siri controls are, the real standout is the Kwikset app. It's smartly designed and filled with features -- most notably, a very strong set of controls for managing multiple users. You can assign each one their own four- to eight-digit code, then choose when those codes will work -- a handy way to let dog sitters or service providers in without giving them 24/7 access.

The best part is that none of that costs anything extra. With some smart locks, including the Kwikset Kevo, you'll need to pay a fee to add an additional user to the lock. That's not the case with the Premis -- you can add as many users as needed for free, then monitor all of the comings and goings from the app's activity log.

I appreciated the lock's other features, too. One of the most clever: a touchpad randomizer that displays two random digits whenever you wake the touchscreen to enter your code. You'll need to press those two digits before proceeding. That might sound like an annoying extra step, but it's actually a smart way to prevent would-be thieves from scanning your smudgy fingerprints to figure out which digits will open the door.

One thing to be aware of, though -- as with other HomeKit-compatible products, you won't be able to access the lock from outside of its Bluetooth range unless you've got a third-gen-or-better Apple TV in your home to act as relay. That's the same shortcoming we saw with the HomeKit-compatible Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt, to which this lock is very similar. At this point, though, an Apple TV is practically a must-have if you're seriously interested in HomeKit.

The Kwikset Premis uses the newest version of its ""SmartKey"" deadbolt, the same as you'll find in other Kwikset locks, including the Kevo. With SmartKey, you can use a little tool to ""re-key"" the lock and make it work with your existing house key.

Perhaps more importantly, the current-gen SmartKey deadbolt is about as secure as they come. It uses a sliding bar instead of the traditional pin and tumblers, which means that you can't ""bump"" it open with a key blank. It's also highly rated against lock-picking, and, unlike earlier versions, it does a good job resisting brute-force attacks like the one we were able to successfully use on the first-gen Kevo a few years ago.

I also appreciated the app's ""Code Disabled"" mode, which lets you temporarily deactivate all codes and restrict the lock to keyed entry only.

Cybersecurity is another reasonable concern, but Kwikset's on good ground here, too. Apple HomeKit is one of the most security-centric smart home platforms we've tested, demanding robust end-to-end encryption on all of the lock's broadcasts. I'd have plenty of confidence in the Premis if I had one installed in my own home.

At $229, the Kwikset Premis does nothing to break the smart lock mold. It looks and behaves just like the smart locks that came before it, and it's just as expensive as they are, too. Even the addition of HomeKit controls is nothing new -- August and Schlage got there first.

But sometimes, in absence of a true step forward, a lateral move can do the trick. In this case, Kwikset did an admirable job of refining its app and offering deep controls over who can use your lock, and how they can use it. It also smartly leaned on Apple HomeKit at a point where the platform's strengths are really starting to shine. This isn't a groundbreaking product, but it's a good one, and it might very well be the right smart lock at the right time."
Ring Stick Up Cam review:|"

Complete with 720p live video streaming, motion-sensing capabilities and an optional cloud storage service, Ring's $199 (£159) Stick Up Cam is strikingly similar to the smart home startup's Ring Video Doorbell, which comes at the same price. The only things that's missing is, you know, the whole doorbell part.

The main benefit to the Wi-Fi-enabled Stick Up Cam lies in its portable weatherproofed design. You can install this camera pretty much anywhere outside,  and power it with a rechargeable battery, a power adapter or an add-on $49 (£40) solar panel accessory.

But there's a downside. Stick Up Cams were designed to complement Ring Video Doorbells. The idea is that you'll have Ring's buzzer watching over your front door and some Stick Up Cams covering any additional ground. And perhaps to ensure that you'll need or want both products, Ring skimped on some key DIY camera features that would allow it to act as a solid standalone security purchase.

The Stick Up Cam is fine, but the Nest Cam Outdoor and Netgear Arlo are stronger DIY security cameras.

The Ring Stick Up Cam is a discreet outdoor-rated security camera with a black finish. It comes with a couple of different base attachments and related hardware. A screwdriver and a drill bit are included with your purchase, too, to help you with the install.

For simplicity and to avoid making permanent holes in the CNET Smart Home, I placed a Stick Up Cam on a flat surface during testing instead of attaching it to a wall or ceiling. You'll want to go with something more long-term if you buy one, since wind and other weather changes can easily knock an outdoor camera out of position. They're easier for someone to steal that way, too.

I wouldn't say the Stick Up Cam has an especially attractive design, but it did easily blend in with the surroundings. Its hardware felt durable as well, and it survived wind and snow flurries without complaint.

Take a look at the chart below to see how Ring's Stick Up Cam compares to other outdoor cameras:

While the Stick Up Cam's specs may look roughly comparable to other outdoor security cameras, it falls short in a couple of key ways. First, you have to pay for cloud storage. While select DIY security companies do charge a monthly or yearly fee for cloud storage, more and more brands are offering some sort of free option.

Netgear's Arlo and Arlo Pro cameras, Canary's Flex and Nest Cam Outdoor all offer free cloud video clips or photos of activity, with the option of upgrading to a paid subscription as needed. Ring charges customers $3 per month or $30 per year for its event-based cloud service. $30 isn't a ton of money to spend, but I wish Ring could somehow include customers who either don't need or don't want to pay for six months of storage.

Second, the Stick Up Cam's 80-degree field of view is pretty narrow. The competition ranges from 110 to 130 degrees, which can make a significant difference in how much of your front yard, driveway or back yard the camera is able to see.

Configuring the Stick Up Cam was roughly the same as setting up any other security camera.

Download the related Ring app on your Android or iPhone, create an account, log in and select ""Set Up Device"" on the home screen. From there, Ring will ask you what product you'd like to install, where you'd like to install it and then it will walk you through a short series of on-screen tutorials showing you how to connect the camera to your Wi-Fi network. It should take 10 minutes tops from start to finish.

Keep in mind that your camera depends on a decent Wi-Fi connection. You might find a great place to install your camera, but if your network doesn't work well in that spot, you might want to look for a new location or consider investing in a Wi-Fi range extender. You can always click on ""Device Health"" in the Ring app to view the strength of your Wi-Fi network when in doubt.

Once you've connected your Stick Up Cam, you can immediately view the live feed. You'll automatically get 30 days of free access to the cloud service so you can see if it's something you want to invest in later on.

The app layout is mostly intuitive, with your camera and any related motion activity displayed on the main screen. If you click on your camera -- I labeled mine ""Backyard"" -- you get access to a lot more features. This is where you can pull up the live feed, opt-in or -out of motion alerts and set custom motion zones and schedules.

While I received the motion alerts promptly, I found the live stream to be surprisingly grainy even when the Device Health section of the app told me my Wi-Fi signal was ""Very Good."" While that isn't a total dealbreaker, it did make 720-pixel HD look more like a 640x480 VGA SD feed. Not ideal.

I also had issues with two-way talk, an intercom feature that is supposed to let you communicate with someone standing near the Stick Up Cam through the Ring app on your phone. I tried this out various times and rarely was able to understand the person on the other end.

In addition to the Stick Up Cam's basic functionality, it also works with a few third-party smart home partners, including IFTTT. I created an IFTTT recipe so that I would receive a text every time the camera detected motion. This was as reliable Ring's own motion alerts, arriving quickly and consistently every time.

Ring also sent me a solar panel accessory to use alongside the Stick Up Cam and that also worked well. You simply plug the solar panel's microUSB adapter into a port on the back of the Stick Up Cam and it will start powering your camera with the sun's energy. Ring says the Stick Up Cam's rechargeable battery can last anywhere from 6 to 12 months, too, if you'd rather go that route.

Ring's Stick Up Cam frustrated me because it has a lot of potential. The different power options give it a ton of versatility, but its core performance and specs don't quite stack up to outdoor cameras from Netgear and Nest. I also wish Ring offered a free cloud storage option, even if it just allowed for 24 hours of event-based clips. While this is a decent option, its relative limitations ultimately make it difficult to recommend over the competition."
iHome iSP8 SmartPlug review:|"

When you're building a smart home, connected in-wall switches are a great way to smarten up your lighting. But in a rental space, you need a lighter-install product: enter the smart plug.

A smart plug can give any pluggable device a brain. And in the case of the $50 iHome ISP8 SmartPlug, one of the leaders in the market, that brain connects your dumb old lamp to Siri, Alexa, Wink, SmartThings or Nest.

The iHome ISP8 is making a play in a tough market, with impressive competitors like iDevices and Belkin. And although the device is an improvement over the older ISP5 SmartPlug, connecting with new platforms and introducing energy monitoring, the ISP8 doesn't offer quite enough to surpass the industry leaders.

The iHome is a solid smart plug that left me with a bad first impression. I set up the device on two Wi-Fi networks, and both times it took at least three attempts to connect successfully. Next, I wanted to integrate the SmartPlug with our Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) -- usually a pretty simple process. Instead, the online directions instructed me to download another app -- Wink -- and set up an additional account to bridge my iHome account and the Alexa app.

When I called iHome's tech support to double check I was following the process correctly, they also walked me through the same directions. It only took an extra 5 or 10 minutes, which wasn't the end of the world, but I didn't want an extra app cluttering up my phone. Later I learned using the Wink app as a bridge was unnecessary in the first place; iHome recently added an Alexa skill to directly integrate with the Echo. The issue with this experience wasn't so much the device itself, but a combination of an annoying setup process and unclear instructions.

After moving past this speed bump, however, the iHome performed admirably. The device connects seamlessly with HomeKit and Siri as soon as you pair it with the iHome app. And setting up the included remote control takes only a few seconds.

The iHome's biggest strength is its broad platform interoperability. Between HomeKit, Echo, Wink, SmartThings and Nest, if you have any smart-home tech around the house, iHome will likely cooperate with something.

The best thing about this multiplatform approach is that you can control the plug using Siri and Alexa. Both platforms let you organize the plug among your other devices, making full home voice control really shine.

The other integrations work effectively, but a smart plug doesn't offer too much to a SmartThings, Wink or Nest ecosystem -- other than to switch on or off when a different gadget triggers it.

And that's the problem with iHome: its broad interoperability doesn't translate to depth of integration. Other than what is now pretty standard energy monitoring -- which you can't even access in any but the iHome app -- the ISP8 doesn't bring much to the table. The lack of IFTTT integration, in particular, means you won't get the same cool and creative triggering options you do with the Belkin WeMo Insight Switch ($34.97 at Amazon.com).

At the end of the day, the iHome ISP8 SmartPlug is a reliable gadget, and it won't disappoint if you have a particular device you're looking to automate. But iHome doesn't do enough to distinguish the ISP8 SmartPlug in the larger market. And I can't recommend it above the industry-leading Belkin WeMo Insight Switch.

Editor's note, December 13: iHome no longer needs the Wink app to integrate with the Amazon Echo, which was a minor criticism in a previous version of this review. The review has been edited to reflect this, and the score changed from 8.0 to 8.1."
Lifx Z Multi-Color LED Wi-Fi Light Strip review:|"

Lifx is a top option in the color-changing smart bulb category, but it's never offered color-changing light strips like the ones you'll find from Philips Hue or Osram Lightify. That changed recently when Lifx introduced ""Lifx Z,"" a set of multicolor LED strips that you can stick up under cabinets or behind your TV set. They connect directly to your router using Wi-Fi just like Lifx lightbulbs do, and even let you ""paint"" each strip with multiple colors -- something you can't do with Philips or Osram.

The starter kit comes with two 1-meter strips and the plug-in power supply for $90 (about £70/AU$120), with additional 1-meter strips selling for $30 (£25/AU$40). While Osram's starter kit is slightly cheaper, Lifx's pricing matches what you'll find with Philips Hue. That makes Lifx Z a viable alternative if you're in the market for RGB smart strips, especially since they don't need any sort of hub or bridge plugged into your router in order to connect with your network.

Getting started with the Lifx Z strips is pretty simple. Connect your strips together and then connect them to the power adapter and plug them in (it can manage up to 10 strips in total). The Lifx app will direct you to connect to the Wi-Fi signal they're broadcasting -- once you do, it'll connect them with your home network and you'll be all set.

The strips have a layer of 3M sticky tape on the back -- just peel and stick to put them in place. I had them up and running under a cabinet at CNET Appliances HQ in just a few minutes; my only concern is that it might be a bit of a pain if you ever want to relocate them to another spot.

You can use the Lifx app to change the color of the   strips (or the color temperature, if you're sticking with natural white light tones). The app treats them like another bulb, so if you want to group them with other Lifx products or include them in any of your scenes, you can.

The one in-app difference with the strips is that you'll notice a horizontal line up above the color wheel. That line shows you the current color of your strips as you rotate the dial -- but its true function comes to light once you tap over into the ""Themes"" section of the app.

Lifx themes are really just thematic groups of colors. Tap on one of those themes -- ""Exciting,"" ""Intense"" and ""Hanukkah"" being just a few examples -- and your selected lights will all change to random colors from that group. It's not terribly useful if you're only controlling one bulb, but with Lifx Z, you're actually controlling multiple ""zones"" of lights -- eight for each one-meter strip in your setup. Tap a theme, and each zone will switch to a random color, which really heightens the effect.

The real novelty here is that you can also ""paint"" whatever colors you want onto the strips. Just select a color from the top of the themes tab and drag it over the horizontal line representing your strips. The app will apply that color to whatever section of the strip you drag it over top of, and even blend the adjacent zones together with transitional shades. It's a downright cool feature -- and something that you can't do with Philips Hue's light strips.

It isn't perfect, though. The controls are fairly imprecise, which stems largely from the fact that the ""brush"" you're painting with is a relatively gigantic circle. On top of that, the more strips you've got connected, the more zones are squeezed into that horizontal line in the app. Your targets get smaller and smaller, but your brush stays just as fat.

Another big problem: there's no way to save any of your custom color patterns, nor can you create your own color themes. The best you can do is to to save your light strips as part of a scene, but if you activate that scene, the strips won't return to your pattern -- they'll just pick the dominant color from the pattern and apply it across the board.

Outside of the app, you'll enjoy all of the same third-party integrations as the rest of the Lifx lineup. You can use the free online automation service IFTTT to trigger lighting changes using any number of IFTTT-compatible products and services. You can add the light strips to a SmartThings connected home setup. You can sync the light strips with an Amazon Echo or Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker for voice control via Alexa, Amazon's virtual voice assistant. In other words, you've got plenty of options for making Lifx Z a part of a larger ecosystem of smart home gadgets.

Color-changing lighting is a smart-home novelty, but it's a fun one, and Lifx Z's $90 starter kit leans on that fun by giving you greater control over the colors it puts out than you'll get with Philips Hue or Osram. Given that the three are comparably priced, and that Lifx Z doesn't need a hub or a bridge plugged into your router, I think it's definitely worth a look.

Still, I wish the features were a bit more refined. More precise control over each zone of lights would be a good start -- even better would be some sort of way to program your own animated light patterns. And Apple users will be disappointed to hear that Lifx products, including Lifx Z, still don't work with Apple HomeKit, the set of iOS-based smart-home protocols that let gadgets work with Siri. I see a lot of potential with this product, but I wouldn't blame anyone who wanted to wait."
Lifx Plus Wi-Fi Smart Bulb review:|"

It's been just a little over four years since Australian inventor Phil Bosua introduced his idea for a color-changing, Wi-Fi-enabled LED on Kickstarter. Now, Lifx is already selling its third-generation smart bulb, the Lifx Plus.

The Lifx Plus looks and works just like the Lifx bulbs that came before it, but it adds in infrared diodes that cast out invisible light when the bulb is turned off. That's the same light that night vision cameras use to see in the dark, which means the Lifx Plus can give NV cameras greater visibility in low light conditions.

It's a cool, creative feature that worked well when I tested it out, which makes Lifx Plus worth considering if you use night vision cameras to keep an eye on your home. But if you don't, then I say don't bother -- at $80 each (which converts to about £65 or AU$105), they cost more than standard Lifx LEDs and they don't bring anything else new to the table besides the night vision trick.

The Lifx Plus sticks to the same flat-topped design as previous-gen Lifx bulbs, adding only a plus sign beneath the Lifx logo. Like the existing Lifx bulbs, it's an 11W LED that promises to put out about as much brightness as a 75W incandescent bulb -- 1,100 lumens.

It sticks to the same playbook on the smarts front, too. Like     the original Lifx LED and last year's second-gen Lifx Color 1000, each Lifx Plus bulb uses a built-in Wi-Fi radio to connect directly with your home network. Once everything's synced up, you'll be able to control the bulbs on your phone from anywhere with an internet connection.

The app controls include a complete spectrum of colors as well as sixteen dedicated white light settings. Those range from a warm, candle-like glow at 2,500 kelvin to hot, bluish-white daylight tones at 9,000 kelvin. The app also offers a number of preset color themes and lighting effects, including a music visualizer and a strobe function. You can also schedule lighting changes to happen at specific times of day, or at sunrise or sunset.

Lifx bulbs are compatible with a variety of third parties. You can sync them up with    the SmartThings connected home platform, the Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Protect smoke detectors. Or you can sync them with the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers and get voice-activated lighting changes through Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant. Lifx also has a fairly robust channel on the online automation service IFTTT, which lets you trigger lighting changes using any number of IFTTT-compatible gadgets and services.

That said, none of those partners are new this generation. Compatibility with    Apple HomeKit, the set of smart home protocols in the software that runs iPhones and iPads, is still missing. HomeKit compatibility is the most-requested feature from the Lifx user base, but for now at least, Lifx COO Tim Peters would only tell  me to ""stay tuned.""

The third-gen Lifx Plus bulbs work just the same as the past Lifx bulbs, but they were at least a little bit brighter than before at every color and white light setting I tested. That's a nice step forward given that they don't use any more energy than last year's bulbs do.

Still, they aren't quite as bright as advertised. At their brightest setting, the default 3,500 kelvin, I was only able to get the Lifx Plus' lumen count up to 1,015 -- a bit short of the stated 1,100 lumens and barely any brighter than last year's Lifx Color 1000. The results were much better at other white light settings, though -- particularly the bluish-white daylight tones, where Lifx Plus offers you an extra 200 lumens or so across the board. A small improvement, but a noticeable one.

The colors have gotten brighter, too, but again, only incrementally so. Compared with the very first Lifx bulbs, the Lifx Plus only puts out noticeably brighter colors at yellow, green and cyan. Other shades essentially finished in a tie, although Lifx Plus always came out slightly ahead.

Lifx continues to nail color accuracy, too, with bold, vivid shades that match whatever color you're trying to select in the app. That's long been   an advantage over arch-nemesis Philips Hue, but not any longer since the latest Hue bulbs finally put out respectable shades of green and cyan.

The Lifx Plus looks just like the Lifx Color 1000 that came before it, because it's essentially the same bulb -- same size, same colors, same features, same app. What's new is the invisible infrared light that shines when the bulb is turned off -- along with a price tag that's $20 higher than before.

So, why would you pay $20 more for a bulb that puts out light you can't see? For many of you, the obvious answer is that you shouldn't, but if you use night vision cameras in your home (Netgear Arlo, Piper, Canary and the Nest Cam being just a few popular examples) then this bulb suddenly becomes pretty interesting.

The basic pitch makes plenty of sense, and offers a lot of ""why didn't anyone think of this before?"" appeal. Night vision cameras don't actually see in the dark -- instead, they're built to see infrared light that the human eye can't see. They typically use their own, built-in infrared diodes to light up whatever the camera is pointed at, letting you see what's going on when the rest of the lights are out. With Lifx Plus, you can fill your living space with additional sources of invisible, infrared light -- which lets your camera see more of what's going on.

It works. We tested it out in the CNET Smart Apartment, where we have a Piper NV smart home camera keeping an eye on the living room. At night, it sees the couch and the coffee table in the foreground just fine, but it struggles to see all the way to the back wall, because the infrared light it puts out can't reach that far. Screwing a Lifx Plus into a floor lamp in the back of the room fixed that, and effectively extended the range of our camera's vision.

Windows are another common sticking point for night vision cameras. Put one in the windowsill looking out at your porch, and most of its infrared light will simply bounce off of the glass. With the Lifx Plus, you could create a pool of infrared light outside of the window, making it much, much easier for your night vision camera to see outside. To that end, the BR30-shaped floodlight version of the Lifx Plus is now sealed and weather-rated for outdoor use -- a smart, thoughtful touch.

First, you'll need to remember that the infrared diodes in the Lifx Plus require power. That means that you'll need to be sure to turn the bulb off using the app, or using one of Lifx's smart home integrations -- Alexa, IFTTT and so on. If you turn the bulb off at the switch, you'll cut the power and the infrared light won't shine.

And yes, this also means that the Lifx Plus is continuing to draw energy even when you've turned the bulb off. This makes it noticeably less efficient than its predecessors. Like the Lifx Color 1000 that came before it, the Lifx Plus draws 11 watts at peak brightness, which will add about $1.32 to your energy bill each year at an average of three hours of use per day. But Lifx Plus will continue to draw about 5 watts during those other twenty-one hours each day as it puts out its infrared light. That brings the energy cost up to about $6 per year.

For this reason, I wish Lifx had included some kind of timer function for the infrared light. As it is now, those infrared diodes shine whenever the bulb is off, regardless of whether you need them or not. Allowing them to only shine at specific hours, or perhaps only between sunset and sundown, would save an awful lot of energy.

Fortunately, this seems like the sort of the thing that Lifx could easily add with a firmware update. The Lifx team already tells me that they plan on doing exactly that to add a feature that will let users adjust the infrared brightness, or automate it using a yet-to-be-activated ambient light sensor in the bulb. Look for that update in the coming months.

The $80 Lifx Plus is just as colorful, capable and connected as the bulbs that came before it. It features the same, solid app interface, the same bright, vivid colors, and the same integrations with IFTTT, Alexa, Nest and more. It's everything that's good about Lifx, plus infrared light for your night vision cameras.

The problem? That infrared light is as far as the ""Plus"" takes you. There's nothing else that's new here -- no other new features, no dramatically better performance, no new support for Apple HomeKit. This is still my favorite color-changing smart bulb, but if you don't use night vision cameras in your home and don't plan on adding them anytime soon, then there's no reason to upgrade from the earlier, less expensive generation."
Roost Smart Smoke Alarm RSA-400 review:|"

The Roost Smart Smoke Alarm is a logical step forward for the company that made the Roost Smart Battery.

The battery is a useful, Wi-Fi-connected 9-volt that fits in your existing alarms and sends push notifications to your phone when the alarm sounds or the battery runs low. The problem with the Roost Smart Smoke Alarm is that it adds nothing to connected smoke detection that the included Roost Smart Battery can't do on its own.

Roost just put its name on a Universal Security Instruments (USI) alarm and called it smart. It's not.

If you do need a new alarm, Roost actually has two options. We tested the $80 RSA-400, which senses smoke, fire, carbon monoxide and natural gas. You can also get the $60 version of the Roost Smart Smoke Alarm -- the RSA-200 -- which just senses smoke and fire. The RSA-400 is reasonably priced. A similar USI smoke and CO detector costs $50, plus the $35 Roost. The RSA-200 is less so, as a USI detector that just smells smoke is only $12.

Either way, I don't recommend replacing a working smoke alarm with a Roost Smart Smoke Alarm just to add remote notifications. You can get that with a $35 Roost Battery and your existing alarm. If you want wholesale smart replacements, I recommend spending a little more for the $100 Nest Protect.

I really liked the Roost Smart Battery when I reviewed it last year. It looks just like an ordinary 9V, so if you can replace a battery, you can install a Roost. Hidden in that familiar form are a Wi-Fi antenna, a microphone and a replaceable power pack that snaps free from the bottom of the battery. Supposedly, a Roost lasts five years. When that time expires, you'll get a notification and you can buy a new power pack for $15.

The Roost App is simple and intuitive. Alerts arrived promptly when we tested it. Now, the Roost works with online rule maker IFTTT so it can integrate with a larger smart-home setup. For example, you can create a recipe that tells your smart lights to flash when your alarm sounds.

Because of how much I liked the Roost battery, I had lofty expectations for the Roost Smart Smoke Alarm. One criticism I had of the battery is that the in-app silencing feature doesn't work on hard-wired alarms. That's understandable, as it's just a battery and it silences the alarm by cutting the power. I thought the Roost Smoke Alarm would certainly address this problem, as well as close the gap between the Roost Battery and Nest in other ways by adding a light, a motion sensor or the ability to talk to other smoke detectors. Nope, nope and nope. The Roost Smoke Alarm adds nothing. In fact, Roost's Smart Battery would be more useful in a different, battery-powered -- app-silenceable -- smoke detector.

In terms of design, the Roost alarm just looks like an ordinary white puck. I wish Roost had done more to help the detector stand out than add its name to the front.

The Roost Smart Smoke Alarm handles the basics well enough. You can buy the Roost RSA-400 for $80 or the RSA-200 for $60 at Home Depot or on Roost's site. Both models are available only in the US for now.

The smoke alarms use the Universal Smoke Sensing Technology of typical USI alarms. Here's a rundown of how smoke detectors work. In short, the ionized variety tends to be faster and cheaper, but more prone to false alarms than photoelectric technology. Nest uses a special form of photoelectric sensing called split spectrum, which supposedly helps its alarms sense a larger variety of fires faster. USI alarms use an ionized setup with a microprocessor to help reduce false alarms.

The Roost Alarm is certified by independent standards organizations such as UL and the FCC. It's ETL Listed, which is another form of certification recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

In practice, Roost's alarm performed well next to an ordinary hard-wired detector -- we used a First Alert hard-wired alarm for comparison. We tested both several times with smoke candles and a canister that sprays smoke. Every time, the ordinary First Alert detector sounded the alarm before the Roost detector, but only by a second or two. The test lined up with our results from the Nest Protect, which was also slightly slower than an ordinary alarm. Once the alarm sounded, the Roost's alerts came to my phone reliably.

The $35 Roost Smart Battery is a great alternative to completely replacing your smoke alarm with something like the Nest Protect. It's not quite as smart as a Nest -- you can't silence all alarms, it doesn't have voice alerts and it doesn't work with as many other connected products as the Protect. But the Roost Battery doesn't have to be as smart as the $100 Nest alarm. It's simple, cost-effective and good at what it does. On the other hand, the $80 Roost Smart Smoke Alarm warrants a direct comparison with the Nest -- and it doesn't measure up.

Both the $80 RSA-400 and the $60 RSA-200 are still cheaper than the Nest alarm and the $80 version costs less than purchasing a similar detector and a Roost separately. The Roost detectors also work well enough that they're worth considering if you need a replacement alarm. If not, there's no advantage to buying the Roost Smart Smoke Alarm over the $35 Roost Battery."
Lutron Caseta In-Wall Wireless Smart Lighting Kit review:|"

If you're thinking of replacing your light switches with smart, app-enabled switches you can automate or control remotely, then Lutron belongs right at the top of your list. It's not particularly close, either.

Put simply, these are the best smart switches money can currently buy. We've been testing them throughout  	the CNET Smart Home for months now, and they're reliable, well-designed, easy-to-use, and loaded with helpful features. Plus, they work with just about everything: Alexa, IFTTT, Nest, Wink, Apple HomeKit -- you name it.

A two-switch starter kit with the mandatory Lutron Bridge retails for $190, which definitely isn't cheap -- especially considering that  	 	 	Belkin WeMo Light Switches cost about $50 each, and don't require any bridge at all. But, after testing both options extensively, I'm convinced that Lutron is the far superior choice, and well worth the extra cash. It's smart lighting that actually feels smart, and a clear Editors' Choice-winner for the connected home.

In terms of looks, Lutron lands right in the smart switch sweet spot. Available in a variety of colors and tones, each switch looks appropriately fancy, yet still understated enough to blend in with most home decor.

That balance applies to the way you use the switches, too. Pressing the button at the top brings the lights to full brightness, while the button at the bottom fades them out. The buttons in the middle allow for fine adjustments. The smooth, gentle fades from setting to setting make each light feel like a high-tech, luxury fixture, but the controls are still perfectly familiar to anyone who's ever used an ordinary old dimmer switch before.

Installing the switches is a cinch, so long as you're comfortable flipping the power off at the breaker. All you'll need is a screwdriver and a few minutes to swap one out. Just connect the three wires -- line, load, ground -- then screw the switch into place, snap the base plate over top of it, and flip the power back on at the breaker.

From there, you'll need to plug the Lutron Bridge into your router via Ethernet cable and connect to it using the Lutron app on your Android or iOS device. Then, you'll pair each switch with the Bridge one at a time by holding a button down when the app tells you to (each Bridge can manage up to fifty devices). If you're just talking about the two-switch starter kit, getting up and running should only take you about 30 minutes, if not less.

The Caseta switches communicate using Lutron's proprietary ""Clear Connect"" wireless protocol, a radio frequency designed for reliability and to minimize interference. The Bridge's job is to act as translator between the switches and your home network. You can also use the Wink Hub to control your Caseta gear, but you'll lose out on Apple HomeKit compatibility.

Lutron wouldn't share any specifics on the steps it takes to keep Clear Connect transmissions and customer data secure, but the nearly sixty-year-old company has a good track record here. A spokesperson adds, ""Lutron's first principle is to take care of the customer. Lutron adheres to and/or exceeds industry standards when it comes to the security of our products and protecting our customers.""

Lutron's app is a snappy standout, with a clean, neatly-organized design and customizable themes. You can tap to control individual lights right from the home screen, or setup preset lighting ""scenes"" to activate with a tap later. Those scenes can also include    Lutron's Serena shades if you have any.

The Lutron app will ask you to name each light as you add it to your setup, and it'll also let you group multiple lights into rooms and zones. The nomenclature comes in handy if you're planning on controlling your lights using Siri commands -- ask her to turn off the kitchen lights or the downstairs lights, and she'll know just what you're talking about.

To that end, you'll also find controls for all of your lights in    Apple's Home app on iOS devices. The Home app also lets you relocate individual light controls straight to your iPhone's Control Center -- just swipe up and tap to turn things on and off without ever opening an app at all.

Beyond turning things on and off, Lutron's app offers a few extra features that do a nice job of separating it from the competition. A geofencing mode lets you program the lights to turn on and off automatically whenever your phone enters and exits the area immediately surrounding your home. A ""Smart Away"" feature can automatically cycle lights on and off in the evening to make it look like you're home when you actually aren't. Integrations with popular smart thermostats from names like Nest, Ecobee and Honeywell will let you adjust the temperature directly from the Lutron app. None of it is complicated, and all of it worked well in my tests.

There's really just one feature that's notably absent from Lutron's app, and that's custom fade durations. You can schedule and automate lighting changes, but you can't control how quickly the lights will fade on or off. That's a disappointment if, like me, you enjoy lighting that can gradually fade up in the mornings to help ease you out of bed.

Lutron's Caseta switches are definitely expensive, especially when you compare them with Belkin's popular  WeMo Light Switches, which cost around $50 a pop. But Lutron's switches enjoy some significant advantages over Belkin, enough for me to say that they're worth the extra money.

Let's start with the biggest one: Lutron's dimmer switches will actually dim the lights. Belkin's WeMo Light Switches won't -- it's either on or off, with no settings in between. That's an enormous advantage for Lutron.

Support for three-way switches is another. Let's say that you have lights over your stairway that are wired to two switches: one at the top of the stairs and one at the bottom. That's called a three-way switch, and if you want to smarten it up, you won't be able to use the Belkin WeMo Light Switch -- it only works in single switch setups.

Lutron doesn't have the same problem. You can install a Caseta switch at the top of the stairs, then install   a wall-mounted Lutron Pico remote at the bottom and pair everything up in the app (Lutron's $190 starter kit includes two Pico remotes, and extras cost about $25 each). We tested the Pico solution in the CNET Smart Home, and it works perfectly.

Finally, though I've already mentioned many of them, the depth of Lutron's features and partnerships really can't be overstated. A   recent integration with Sonos that lets you incorporate your playlists into your Lutron scenes is a good example. Lutron went so far as to develop Sonos-specific hardware with an audio version of its Pico remote, and also lets you trigger those audio-enabled scenes using an Alexa command. In other words, Lutron's team isn't just checking off boxes when they integrate with third parties -- they're actually putting those partners to good use.

Beyond Belkin, your other smart switch alternatives include options from  GE/Jasco, Quirky and SwitchMate. None of them offer the same depth of features and controls that you'll get with Lutron. The yet-to-be-released iDevices Light Switch is another option we'll be keeping an eye out for. Like Lutron, it'll offer support for both Alexa and HomeKit, but at an expected retail price of $100 per switch, it'll be even more expensive.

Lighting control is central to the modern smart home, and Lutron's cloud-connected light switches do the job exceptionally well. They're easy to install, easy to program, and easy to use with a variety of popular platforms, including Apple HomeKit, Amazon's Alexa, IFTTT, Nest, Wink, Sonos and more. They're further ahead of the curve than any other smart switch on the market, and a deserving Editors' Choice-winner.

At $190 for a two-switch starter kit and about $60 for each switch after that, Lutron definitely isn't your cheapest option -- but keep in mind that Lutron frequently runs sales and specials designed to entice you to buy in (as of publishing this, Amazon's offering the starter kit  for just $160). Even at full price, these switches are well worth it if you're serious about smart lighting."
Sleep Number It review:|"

Sleep Number's $1,099 It Bed connected queen mattress tracks how well you sleep via built-in sensors and integrations with select products from  	Nest, Fitbit and other companies. It is much smarter than your average bed. The comfortable foam mattress even has two inner air chambers so you and a partner can pick your own firmness settings.

While all of that tech has the potential to offer useful sleep tips, the amount of data the mattress collected from me and my husband, Kevin, didn't match up with the amount of information we were getting back from it. Unexpected glitches in the related SleepIQ app also led to inaccurate sleep scores and missing data -- Sleep Number says it's working on these issues.

Yes, this is a cozy mattress, but the smarts need to be more reliable before I'd suggest most people spend the money on Sleep Number's It Bed. If Sleep Number can smooth out the data gathering quirks, the It Bed could be worth it to those interested in dissecting charts and graphs in pursuit of a good night's sleep.

The It Bed by Sleep Number arrived in a single large box. You can install the mattress over a platform-style slatted bed frame. That means you don't have to buy Sleep Number's frame and base if you already have something that will work -- or if you simply want to buy a frame from another manufacturer.

For reference, the frame and base accessories are sold as a unit for an additional $499, taking the grand total up to $1,598. You can buy headboards and related hardware through Sleep Number, too.

Aesthetics didn't factor in heavily with the It Bed, since it's  going to be covered by sheets 99 percent of the time. It's a pretty  attractive mattress all the same. The knit fabric covering it  looks like a mattress cover, even though it's technically an integrated part of the mattress design.

Note: I reviewed the $1,099 queen mattress, but Sleep Number also offers other sizes. A twin version goes for $799 or you can pay up to $1,499 for either a king or a California king mattress. Find out more on  	Sleep Number's site.

Setting up the mattress was as simple as taking  it out of the box, setting it on the bed frame and  giving the mattress some time to regain its natural shape. There's a small green  tag on one corner of the mattress -- that side needed to be positioned at  the foot of the bed for the tech to work properly.

Now grab the ActiveComfort Technology Module -- this is a smallish black gizmo with two tube connectors sticking from either end. Lift up the end of the mattress slightly, unzip the small pocket in the middle and connect the power cord and the air hoses (they're color-coded for easy install). This is the device that pumps air into either side of the bed. Slide everything back into the zippered pocked and close it. Then, connect the cord at the head of the bed to the included power adapter and plug it into a nearby outlet.

You'll need the Android or iPhone SleepIQ app to access every feature offered by this bed. Unlike other Sleep Number mattresses, the It Bed doesn't come with a separate remote or any other hardware you can use to see your settings and make adjustments. Follow the in-app steps to pair the bed to your Wi-Fi network and create a profile. You can also extend access to your partner so they can create their own login and profile.

The only issue I ran into here was that the air tubes had shifted during shipping, so I had to reach into the zippered pocket to find them. Fortunately, everything else was very simple.

With the bed installed, you can get to the fun part --  sleeping.

Here's what I liked:

Here's what I didn't like:

I was disappointed that Sleep Number doesn't tell you what the right level of firmness is for you or auto-adjust it for you over time. As someone who's never bought a mattress, I have absolutely no idea which setting is ""best for me.""

I personally found every setting I tried comfortable -- and SleepIQ never offered any sort of guidance on that front. So I randomly chose 95 and it seemed to work fine. (100 is the firmest setting.)

The mattress is comfortable -- the ability to customize your level of firmness helps with thisThe daily SleepIQ charts detail exactly when and for how long you were restless or out of bed (see screenshot)

You can't be in bed while it's inflating/deflating and SleepIQ doesn't help you pick your ideal firmnessA few different glitches led to inaccurate SleepIQ readings, as well as missing dataThe custom messages and third-party integrations aren't actually very useful

It wasn't quite the same for Kevin. He started with a high SleepIQ number and then adjusted down to a 60, which he ultimately found much more comfortable. If you aren't sleeping well on this mattress, you can always  experiment with different settings.

I also experienced some odd glitches. On election day (Tuesday, November 8), SleepIQ gave me a score of 38 out of 100. That isn't very good. But when I checked my chart, the app said I had gotten 15 hours and 34 minutes of restful sleep. Well, that definitely didn't happen.

According to Sleep Number, my dog, Halley, was the culprit. Apparently, she jumped on my side of the bed not long after I woke up and the tech still thought it was me. Another time the app didn't record any data at all. And another time still, the mattress calculated an average breathing rate for the night, but not a heart rate.

Kevin and I set up a ton of stuff to test out with the It Bed. I installed a Nest Learning Thermostat in our house, and Kevin and I both wore Fitbits. I also wore an  Apple Watch, paired my MapMyRun account and logged my weight on a Withings and a Fitbit scale.

Halfway through testing I found out Withings scales aren't actually compatible with the It Bed -- information I was unable to find either on Sleep Number's or Withings' sites. Unfortunately, the other integrations didn't add much value, either. The Nest thermostat pulled in ambient temperature data, but never distilled it in a way that helped me understand  how the temperature impacts my sleep. And the same goes for all of the fitness tracking we did. SleepIQ collected a ton of data, but never once used it to give us sleep-related tips. Frustrating.

Sleep Number tells me SleepIQ gets smarter over time, but after 30-plus days of sleeping on the It Bed, these are the only suggestions we received:

Are you interested in smart sleep tech, but  don't want to drop $1,000-plus on a smart mattress? There are actually  quite a few options out there for you. Here's a quick rundown:

Yes, many fitness trackers are marketed as exercise devices, but most of them have adopted a more holistic health and wellness approach to offer some sort of sleep monitoring capabilities as well. For that, take a look at the  Fitbit Charge 2, the Jawbone Up2, Microsoft's Band 2, the Garmin Vivosmart 2, or the Basis B1 Band.

There are plenty of sleep accessories that you don't have to wear on your wrist, though. The  Beddit Sleep Monitor Classic is a wireless sensor that rests on your mattress, Samsung's SleepSense is a similar concept that you tuck under your mattress and the Hello Sense is an alarm clock that comes with movement trackers called Sleep Pills. Clip one to your pillowcase and let it track your zzz's.



Still unsure? Click through the gallery below to see even more sleep tech.

Sleep Number's It Bed isn't the only mattress decked out with connected tech, but it's actually priced pretty well when you look at some other brands.

Elements of Rest's Eve2 by Rest Revolution queen mattress has dual sides similar to the It Bed for $899, but it doesn't offer any additional smart tech. Simmons/BeautyRest sells SmartMotion bases that report similar stats as the It Bed starting at $1,199. Other brands offer some version of a smart mattress/bed frame at prices well over It's $1,099 -- Kingsdown's Sleep Smart Intuitive queen mattress, for instance, which comes with different support zones and a related app, sells at Mattress Warehouse for a whopping $11,854.

So, when it comes to smart beds, Sleep Number's It is actually quite reasonable, but $1,099 is still expensive for a queen mattress. The question is: Is it worthwhile to spend the extra 250 bucks on the It Bed over a similar-style (but non-smart) foam mattress like  an $850 Casper?

Maybe. If you really want to set custom firmness settings and  track your sleep, the It Bed could be worth it. Just don't get it for  its third-party integrations alone. If you're iffy on these features,  I'd suggest going with a non-smart mattress and simply adding in some  sleep-related accessories instead.

I slept on the It Bed by Sleep Number for weeks,  documenting my progress here in diary-style posts. Check them out if you want to know more about the testing process.

Everspring Z-Wave Wireless Flood Detector review:|"

Flood sensors ($35.94 at Amazon.com) might seem simple -- and on one level they are: they simply use probes to set off an alarm when they make contact with water, which increases the conductivity between them. But despite that relative simplicity, there's also a lot of room for creative design by the companies that make flood sensors. Some have water-sensing probes attached to their bodies, while others have cables with twisted probes embedded in them for long sensing range. And then there's Everspring.

The Everspring Z-Wave Wireless Flood Detector has a single wire that stretches about 8 feet, and at the end of it: a two-prong probe. While Everspring's $40 device certainly isn't as feature-rich as others on the market, it meets a very specific need, and does so reliably. The problem is, that need is too niche for most users.

Here are the Everspring Flood Detector's features:

Everspring doesn't have temperature or humidity sensing. It doesn't have tilt-sensing. Really, it has very few features to speak of, besides that long wired probe. Granted, that wire allows for easy monitoring of sump pump well water levels without letting water anywhere near the device itself. But is that feature alone worth $40?

Everspring's device has a bigger problem: it essentially does exactly what the Aeotec Flood Sensor does, but for more money. Although in rare instances having an 8-foot wired probe might be useful, for the majority of users, it's unnecessary.

While Everspring performs reliably, it simply doesn't boast enough distinguishing features to recommend it over more useful and affordable alternatives.

Samsung SmartThings Water Leak Sensor review:|"

Sometimes, simplicity is better. SmartThings as a smart home control system works because each individual component, from motion sensors to locks to lights, performs its function well. That cooperation creates a broadly successful system that accomplishes complex tasks.

In that context, the SmartThings Water Leak Sensor ($37.99 at Amazon.com) is a fine device. It does what it's supposed to: alerts you via push notification and in the SmartThings app when it detects water. But for $40, I wish it did just a little bit more.

Here are the features of the SmartThings Water Leak Sensor:

What it doesn't have:

I love how simple it is in some ways -- I really could see myself buying a few of these and just tossing them under sinks and beside pipes around the house. And the SmartThings sensor has a clever design that funnels water toward the probes on its underside.

The problem is, if you're looking for a gadget to set off alarms, monitor large areas or alert you to other potential problems like humidity, then SmartThings is just too simple to help you. Plus, it requires an investment in the SmartThings hub if you don't already have one -- making it much more expensive in total.

If you already use the SmartThings platform, and want a simple gadget to monitor your home for floods, this Leak Sensor is a solid pick. Otherwise you'll want to find a different device. We've reviewed several, so click here for our take on which flood sensor to buy.

Aeon Labs Aeotec Water Sensor review:|"

Flood sensors ($35.94 at Amazon.com) don't need bells and whistles to work well; they just need to tell you when your basement is flooding. You can make your own flood sensor and alarm for a couple bucks, but if you want one that sends you push notifications on your phone, one of the most affordable options is the $35 Aeon Labs Aeotec Water Sensor.

The big catch with some leak detectors, including Aeotec, is that you need a smart-home hub like SmartThings or Wink to use them. Why? Because the detectors function using a communication protocol called Z-Wave, which essentially allows them to work with low energy consumption, and send messages that the hub translates into alerts that it sends to your phone. If you want something that communicates directly with your phone without a hub, you'll have to dish out more money for devices like the D-Link Wi-Fi Water Sensor or the Honeywell Lyric Leak and Freeze Detector.

If you do have one of these smart-home hubs, Aeotec is a great option for a flood sensor. It's simple, but it performs its function reliably. The only major issue it has is that it relies on a wired probe. Essentially, the dual-probe that most flood sensors use to detect water, is connected to a long wire, making it useful for attaching to the edge of a sump pump well or open floor drain. But if you want to just set it under a sink or in a particular problem area of your basement, its wired probe won't be ideal.

One problem every flood sensor needs to address is how it will be powered. Aeotec relies on batteries, so it will still send alerts even if the power goes out. The batteries should last well over a year, but you'll need to replace them to keep the device doing its job.

While Z-Wave  and the wired probe end up limiting the Aeotec Sensor, they also mean it will work well for people with particular needs. So if you have a Z-Wave bridging smart hub, and want to monitor water levels in your sump pump, then the Aeotec Sensor is a great option."
D-Link Wi-Fi Water Sensor review:|"

The design behind leak sensors is actually pretty cool: essentially, most sensors have two or three metal probes that, when they come in contact with water, detect increased conductivity and set off an alarm. It's an elegant solution to the age-old problem of flooding.

But D-Link takes an even more creative approach. Rather than using probes, D-Link's Wi-Fi Water Sensor uses a cable with long, twisting leads embedded in it. You can run the cable along the edge of your basement floor, say, and if water touches it anywhere, the twisted leads detect increased conductivity and set off an alarm. It's a little like what we did when we created our own flood detector last winter.

D-Link is unique for more reasons than the cable, though. The base unit also plugs directly into a wall, negating the need for batteries, and connects via Wi-Fi to your phone -- cutting out the smart home hub middleman that limits so many other flood sensors ($35.94 at Amazon.com).

The result is a solid product with a slightly higher price of $60 (compared with its $40 competitors that work with SmartThings or Wink).

D-Link's biggest strength is also a weakness, though. It doesn't need batteries, but if the power goes out at the same time as a flood, it can't do anything. Sure, battery-dependent devices won't be able to communicate with their hubs if the power is out, but they can at least sound an audible alarm. Not so with D-Link.

Here are D-Link's specs:

While the D-Link doesn't have the same ability to measure temperature and humidity of more expensive units, it makes up for it by integrating with IFTTT. This allows users to creatively connect the D-Link Sensor to their smart LEDs, their phone's apps, or even a smart switch with an alarm. It's a cool approach to allow users interested in DIY problem-solving the freedom to plug the D-Link into a much larger system of integrated gadgets.

If you're looking for a connected flood sensor this season, D-Link's device is one of the best on the market.

Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector review:|"

When you think of luxury products, you probably don't picture flood sensors. But Honeywell's Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector is just that. It can do more than its competitors, and it's easier to use, since it doesn't need a smart hub to function.

What could be a great premium device, however, doesn't quite live up to the hype. A few odd design choices make its $80 price tag feel too steep.

Here are the specs for the Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector:

Just in terms of skills, this flood sensor beats out pretty much all the competition. Its cable range extender makes it a much more flexible device for the needs of different users. And its battery power is impressive, considering Wi-Fi-based gadgets typically require more power than Z-Wave or Zigbee devices.

Connects with Wi-Fi (meaning no smart hub is needed)Measures temperature and humidityIncludes a cable to extend its sensing rangeCan send alerts in case of flood, or specific temperature/humidity levelsBattery-powered with an estimated life of 1-3 years (depending on your settings)

But the Honeywell has two problems. First, it isn't waterproof. That means more than a centimeter of water on the floor, and you're starting to jeopardize the electrical guts of your device. This is the definition of a screen door on a submarine, and I have a hard time explaining such a design decision, other than to call it a major mistake.

Second, the Honeywell doesn't integrate with anything other than the Honeywell Lyric Thermostat ($149.99 at Amazon.com). That means even the cheaper D-Link Flood Sensor, which also uses Wi-Fi connection, beats the Lyric out by integrating with IFTTT.

Between the lack of waterproof design, the limited integration possibilities, and the high price, users might be reticent to pull out their wallets. And besides, do you really need all these features? Maybe, maybe not.

Either way, the Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector is an impressive product in terms of features. It's just hard to reconcile the price with such a basic design flaw as not being waterproof."
Almond 3 Smart Home Wi-Fi system review:|"

Let me be straight up: As a single router or smart-home hub, the Securifi Almond 3 is isn't bad. It has decent speeds, is easy to use and set up, it's reasonably priced at $150, and it has seamless voice activation, thanks to its Amazon Alexa integration. The problem is, Securifi wants it to be more than just a good router/smart-home hub combo.

If you purchase the Almond as a Wi-Fi system or mesh network, it comes with three identical router units for $400. The first unit serves as your main router while the other two extend the first router's signal, blanketing your large home with Wi-Fi. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.

Wi-Fi systems like the  Eero and Netgear Orbi 	 promise expansive Wi-Fi coverage with simple setup and maintenance. And while both the Eero and Orbi deliver on this promise, the mesh network features on the Almond 3 feel tacked on and are buggy as hell.

The Almond 3 is trying to be many things. It's perfectly fine as a single router or smarthome hub, but utterly fails as a mesh network with too high a price tag, an unreliable connection and an antiquated and buggy interface.

As a router and smarthome hub, this is a midlevel 802.11ac Wi-Fi router. It doesn't offer the fastest Wi-Fi speed but it's more than fast enough to deliver any residential internet connection. What makes it different from other routers, however, is the fact it comes with a touch screen -- similar to the  	Starry -- and a built-in one-volume-level speaker that works as an alarm (like a digital alarm clock). Apart from Wi-Fi, it can also work with other smart-home devices such as security sensors via a popular wireless standard for home automation called called ZigBee 1.2 and is compatible with 	 hundreds of web-connected devices 	.

The device is small, but in my trial it's still powerful enough to cover a small home, say, about 1,500 square feet, with a strong Wi-Fi signal as long as it's placed in the middle of the living space.

As a Wi-Fi system, one  of the three units works as a router and  the other two as extenders, effectively extending the range of the Wi-Fi network. When all three are used together and placed at optimal distances from one another, they create a mesh network that can cover up to 4,000 square feet with a Wi-Fi signal.

You can control the Almond 3 from three different platforms: the touchscreen on the device, a separate mobile app that you'll need a phone or tablet to access, and a web interface via your home computer. The problem is, no single platform gives you complete control. Instead, you need to use all three to customize the system.

That would be bad enough, but it's compounded by a device that appears to be using the same touchscreen technology as the  	 original Almond 	 released four years ago. So don't expect a modern phone-like experience here. It's more like a  	Palm Treo 	 and is as archaic as the product shots you can see at the previous link. In fact, Securifi included a stylus with the Almond 3, because your fingers just aren't the best tool for this product.

So yeah -- this is not the kind of touchscreen you'd expect from a modern device. But since some features can only be accessed from the screen, you unfortunately won't be able to avoid it.

While most routers take about 30 seconds to boot up, the Almond 3 takes a full three minutes. With the multiple restarts required to complete the setup process, you'll easily spend about half an hour before you can start using a single unit of the Almond 3, which is not too bad.

Adding additional units to create a Wi-Fi system proved to be frustratingly time consuming, however, simply because it just didn't work most of the time. There's a wizard on the touchscreen to enable this process, and everything happened as intended -- until the last step where it was supposed to take ""up to three minutes"" for the two units to connect. Five minutes went by and nothing happened, and then it timed out, prompting me to reset the satellite unit to its factory default settings and start from beginning. The second time I tried it, the same thing happened. Finally, on my third try, it worked. But I had no idea what I did wrong on the first two attempts.

The router's screen is supposed turn itself off after being idle for a couple of minutes. But that only happens if you leave it at the the Home screen. If you go to the Status screen, for example, it will stay on forever, even if I have set a password to lock it.

When one of the Almond 3 units is being used as a satellite, clearly it's not functioning as a router. However, all of the router function icons still appear onscreen. When you tap on one of them, you get a message telling you the feature isn't available.



When I changed certain settings using the Almond app, especially the Wi-Fi networks' names, one or more of these would likely happen:

All that considered, when I just used the default settings, everything seemed to work fine. So if you just want to use the system as it comes out of the box without customizing it, chances are you will have fewer problems.

The Almond 3 is one of the first routers with  built-in support for smart homes. The Almond 3 is equipped to send and receive signals via ZigBee, a wireless frequency commonly used by smart-home gadgets, including the Philips Hue bulbs we use at 	  the CNET Smart Apartment. This means once you plug an Almond 3 in, you'll be able to control them right from Almond's app.

This was exactly the case in CNET's test. Keep in mind, however, that only a single Almond 3 router was used for this test, as CNET's Smart Home team couldn't get all three units to work together as a mesh Wi-Fi network.

Aside from turning things on and off, Almond's app lets you control when specific devices are allowed to access the network. You can also label your kids' devices, then block them all at once when it's time to log off and go to bed. If you don't want to be the bad cop, sync Almond up 	  with the Amazon Echo smart speaker 	, then tell Alexa to do it (and no, the kids can't ask her to turn things back on -- you can only unblock devices from within Almond's app).

Almond's app also features a pretty powerful rules engine. It follows an ""if this, then that"" framework that's similar to 	  the free automation service IFTTT. However, unlike IFTTT, it'll let you pick out multiple triggers and multiple actions. You could, for instance, create a rule that turns your lamps on and sends a loved one a notification whenever you return home after 9 p.m..

The Almond 3 is good at detecting your presence because it tracks your phone's Wi-Fi signal. As soon as that signal jumps onto Almond's network, it knows that you're returning home. In CNET's tests, this Wi-Fi-based geofencing worked flawlessly, reliably turning things on and off as we'd come and go. Securifi also offers accessories like a motion detector, an open/closed sensor, and a smart button -- triggering automated rules using those devices worked well, too.

All of it is more than enough for the Almond 3 to live up to the ""smart router"" billing. It's just a shame that the shoddy networking leaves those smarts more or less moot.

As a single Wi-Fi router, the Almond 3 performed well compared with other dual-stream (2x2) 802.11ac routers. It has a top close distance speed (within 15 feet) of 315Mbps and when I increased the range to 75 feet, it still averaged 220Mbps. Range was good, too, as it functioned up to 130 feet away with two walls in between. Also, it passed my 48-hour stress test (where I let it constantly transfer a large amount of data between multiple Wi-Fi clients) with no problem -- it didn't disconnect even once during this time.

As a Wi-Fi system (three units working in tandem), however, it was a completely different story. First, it failed the stress test after just a few hours. In real-world usage, I was disconnected quite often during multiple gaming sections (really frustrating!). My gaming PC didn't completely disconnect, but it still took a few seconds to reconnect to the network, which was more than enough time to lose a game of Hearthstone. That said, if you're just surfing the web, you likely won't notice the disconnection.

In terms of speed, the Almond 3 system was par for the course as Wi-Fi extenders go. Clients connected to the extender are expected to have some 50 percent less speed than those connected directly to the main router. This is because the extender needs to do both receiving the signal (from the main router) and rebroadcasting it. The only Wi-Fi system on the market that doesn't suffer from this signal-loss phenomenon is the Netgear Orbi.

If you live in a small place and want a router that lets you connect all your smart-home devices, at $150 the Almond 3 isn't a bad deal. It's not the best router in the world, but performance is solid.

However, as a Wi-Fi system, $400 is just too much to pay when there are better, less buggy, more reliable and easier to use ""Wi-Fi for dummies"" systems like the  Eero or Netgear Orbi out there. Securifi seems to have shoehorned mesh network features onto its existing Almond hardware instead of developing a new system from the ground up. The result is a product with an archaic, buggy and unintuitive interface. And while you might be able to avoid the bugs by sticking to the default settings, the sporadic disconnection remains a major shortcoming. The Almond 3 system does a lot, but unfortunately doesn't excel at enough to be worth a purchase.

Wait for the price to significantly decrease or a firmware update that addresses the current issues.

A message would appear reading ""unable to change setting"" even though the setting had changed anyway. 	One or both satellite units was disconnected from the primary router.  	The old network names were still available, along with the new ones, resulting in four networks instead of two. (By default, the Almond 3 has two Wi-Fi networks, one for the 2.4GHz band and another for the 5GHz band.) 	One of the new secured networks would suddenly become unsecured.

Netgear's next Arlo security camera goes where Wi-Fi can't|"

If you'd like to monitor a cabin, a campsite -- any remote location -- that doesn't get a reliable Wi-Fi connection, Netgear might have the product for you. The networking company's line of DIY home security devices is expanding today with the launch of the $450 US-only Arlo Go Mobile HD Security Camera.

Arlo Go, which is expected to hit stores in the United States in early 2017, isn't much of a design departure from the original Arlo cams or the next-gen Arlo Pro cams. Coated in the same weatherproofed indoor/outdoor white plastic finish, Arlo Go also has a lot of the same features as its predecessors.

Here's a list of the basics:

But Arlo Go diverges from Netgear's other offerings via compatibility with AT&T's 3G and LTE wireless networks. In theory, then, you should have mobile access ""anywhere in the AT&T nationwide coverage area,"" or so Netgear's official press release claims. Of course, data plans are available as an add-on feature, so you'll have to pay for a subscription to use this option.

Note: Arlo Go doesn't work over Wi-Fi at all, so you need to be sure you want to go exclusively with a cellular plan before you buy.

I'm intrigued by this product, but Netgear certainly isn't the first company to announce a mobile-enabled product. Startup Canary, makers of the Canary Smart Home Security Device, introduced the Canary Flex back in September. A $199 indoor/outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's also compatible with an optional Verizon cellular LTE mount, Canary Flex seems to offer roughly the same functionality for less money up front.

As with every product we cover, we'll just have to get a couple of review units in to compare Arlo Go and Canary Flex side-by-side and see for ourselves. Loyalty to either AT&T or Verizon might help a lot of customers make this decision easily, though.

In the meantime, have a look at some other outdoor security cameras we've written about.

Turn your food waste into fertilizer in a day with Zera (hands-on)|"

Hi, I'm Megan, and I'm a grocery store junkie. See, I love food, so when I happen across a fruit I've never seen or a hard-to-find vegetable, I tend to snatch it up and ask questions later. Flash-forward a week and I've likely devoured a lot of what I bought, but those forgotten Japanese eggplants are well past prime. What to do?

Well, I could get better about meal planning, but in the meantime I have two main options: chuck the leftovers in a garbage bag bound for a landfill or toss them in a compost pile to make fertilizer. The first option is fast and convenient. The second option can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to over a year; the compost-to-fertilizer time frame can vary a lot depending on the size of the pile and your level of active involvement with it.

WLabs, the arm of Whirlpool Corporation tasked with designing, developing and manufacturing small-batch products on the quirkier side of the spectrum, has found a clever, albeit pricey, alternative to composting. The $1,199 WLabs by Whirlpool Corporation Zera Food Recycler claims to turn your food waste into fertilizer in just 24 hours.

The WLabs/Whirlpool team visited the CNET Smart Home here in Louisville, Kentucky earlier this month for an in-person demo of Zera. For now, Zera is just a prototype, but WLabs and Whirlpool Corporation plan to launch an Indiegogo campaign in early January. Depending on the success of that project, Zera will make its way to the broader market.

WLabs has set its earliest ""Early Bird"" pricing tier for Indiegogo backers at $699 -- a significant discount on that $1,199 MSRP. Previous WLabs  products include the Vessi beer fermenter and the Swash ""clothes refresher.""

Similar to GE's FirstBuild, the Michigan-based WLabs seems like a research and development fan's paradise, a place where employees brainstorm ideas and rely on the adjacent microfactory to test concepts and produce functional prototypes. Zera is simply the latest WLabs creation, one that's being officially unveiled at CES 2017  -- fortunately, we got an exclusive early look.

Zera looks like a very classy extra-tall kitchen garbage can with an integrated touch display and a related app (the software was still in development during our demo, but expect to be able to start and stop a Zera cycle remotely -- no third-party smart-home integrations are currently in the works).

Zera's exterior has a white finish and a plasticky bamboo-effect sliding top lid that gives you access to a garbage-disposal-looking interior compartment. Below that you'll find a second, slide-out compartment -- this is where you'll get your fertilizer post-cycle.

The idea is that you'll plug the included power cord into a nearby outlet and leave Zera as a 24-7 fixture in your kitchen. This device does looks pretty sleek, but it's also on the large side and not every kitchen layout will have a reasonable spot to permanently stick a Zera. It worked out pretty well in the CNET Smart Home kitchen lined up with the large center island, but some folks will have to get creative with placement.

Zera is designed to hold up to 8 pounds of food, which according to Whirlpool is the rough equivalent to the amount of waste a typical family of four creates in a week. The idea is that you'll use Zera like a receptacle over that week -- tossing in apple cores, onion skins, moldy bread and whatever is left on your plate after a meal.

Every time you throw in something new and slide the lid closed, Zera is supposed to sense it and initiate a 2-minute process to push the food to the bottom of the main reservoir. This is supposed to help make room for more food to come, but it also serves as an initial step to prepare the food for ""recycling"" later on. I got to see this in action during the demo -- you can hear it, but it wasn't as loud as my dishwasher at home.

When you're ready to begin a cycle, simply hold the start button on Zera itself (or use the app, once that's up and running). I got to try this myself after tossing in whole apples, carrots, cheese, broccoli, dinner rolls, coffee grounds, tuna salad, cottage cheese -- all sorts of stuff. We didn't run a whole cycle, but I did briefly get to experience how a production-model Zera should work. Like those 2-minute preliminary runs, the main cycle was pretty quiet, although I don't know if it gets louder at different periods throughout.

Aside from the obvious convenience of an in-kitchen composter, Zera is also decked out with tech that reduces a weeks-long process to anywhere from 16 to 24 hours. The team told me it primarily uses heat and airflow to accomplish this. But there is one other component -- a small paper baggie containing coconut husks that have been transformed into uniform little pellets that look like rabbit food. Coconut shells have been used in gardening to supplement mulch for years, as they help retain water and their fiber contributes nutrients to fertilizer. It's the same idea here, but WLabs will sell manufactured four-packs for $12 a pop. Toss in a bag (really, just throw in the whole thing unopened) before you start a cycle and then you're ready to go.

WLabs said the coconut husks aren't absolutely essential to this process, but that ""the quality of the homemade  fertilizer will decrease"" without them. Buy them or not -- it's really up to you.

WLabs brought Zera-made fertilizer to the demo so I could see exactly what the finished product should look like. For every 8 pounds of food waste, Zera makes about 2 pounds of fertilizer that's ready to be stored or to go straight to your next gardening project. A representative from WLabs listed off a variety of flowers and vegetables the team had already grown using Zera fertilizer.

Whether you're deeply concerned about your food ending up in a landfill -- or you simply want to re-purpose those leftovers into food for your garden, Zera presents a seriously smart alternative to traditional composting. But $1,199 is a huge amount to spend, especially when you can buy standard, outdoor composting bins and related accessories for well under 100 bucks. At the same time, there's a huge convenience factor here that might make the price worthwhile for some.

And, if you get in on the action early, you can snatch one up for $699 -- a solid discount for early backers. We've already requested a review unit, too, so we'll be running our own cycles to see just how fast Zera works, as well as spending time testing out the companion app."
Shortcut Labs FlicSingle Smart Button review:|"

The device that best captures the spirit of the smart home might just be the smart button. It's affordable, simple, and makes all your digital silos cooperate. One of the best smart buttons on the market is the $34 Shortcut Labs Flic ($94.50 at Amazon.com), which works magic with over 40 devices and platforms -- from controlling Philips Hue LEDs to IFTTT recipes. The big appeal of a device like Flic is the combination of its flexibility and affordability.

But Shortcut Labs is experimenting with a new smart button -- one that cuts the original Flic's price to $20, and cuts the flexibility out almost entirely. The FlicSingle series of buttons includes five products: FlicMusic, FlicLights, FlicSelfie, FlicFind, and FlicLocation. These gadgets use the same basic mechanisms to perform actions -- triggering the IFTTT-like Flic app on your phone via Bluetooth using button taps. Unlike the original Flic, however, these buttons are made to perform only one function or set of functions.

The best FlicSingle so far is easily FlicLights. It keeps just enough customization in place to make the button feel smart, but its focused purpose and reliable performance lend it an elegant simplicity.

The FlicLights button is basically an affordable connected light switch for your home. I like that the FlicLights button hasn't abandoned all flexibility: you get to map three personalized commands to the three separate button press patterns (press, double-press, long hold). That means you're not restricted to the on/off capabilities of a typical switch, but can also customize a third setting. This variety of commands works well with colored bulbs or preset scenes from the lighting apps.

Two problems impede an otherwise impressive device. First, you have to already own connected LEDs. Unlike hard-wired smart light switches, FlicLights won't turn your dumb lights smart. Second, because it relies on the Bluetooth connection with your phone, you have to always have the app running and the phone nearby. This is a minor drawback for the most part -- except if you have multiple people in the same house planning to use the button. It can only pair with one phone at a time.

But such imperfections aren't surprising with a device that costs $20. In fact, what makes FlicSingles cool is their lower price of entry. They let you try out a new smart-home gadget without breaking the bank, which is rare in the industry. Plus, they add simple labels to the face of the buttons so you know which ones perform which actions.

The FlicLights button fuses the simplicity of a conventional light switch with the smarts of app-connected LEDs, leaving users with a device much like the Philips Hue Tap ($41.84 at Amazon.com), but at less than half the price.

For anyone looking to optimize their smart LED usage, FlicLights is a solid option.

None of the other FlicSingles attain the success of the FlicLights Button.

The FlicFind button has only one simple function: it sets off an alarm on your phone when you're having trouble finding it. This button went too simple, and it suffers from a dependence on the Flic app always running -- something you can't guarantee if you're already looking for a missing phone.

The FlicLocation button essentially acts as a beacon for friends or family in case of emergency. Sure, it works, but only if the app is running in the background. And instead of tracking your location and sending updates, it simply sends a set of coordinates once. If I were looking for a device to make me feel safer, FlicLocation wouldn't be my first pick -- but it might be a backup.

The FlicMusic button is one of the more flexible FlicSingles. You can control your music via Apple Music, Spotify, or Sonos devices -- assigning any commands for those platforms to the Flic's press, double-press, or long hold toggles. For the casual listener, the FlicMusic is definitely worth considering, but only among other products.

FlicSelfie is the worst FlicSingle Smart Button released. Users can take a picture with their phone by pressing the smart button, but the app has to be running and the camera has to be up. Thus, a lot of the creative uses for the FlicSelfie are wasted. Sure, your Uncle Chris won't have to set the camera timer and race across the room to make it into family photos, but that leaves you with a device that's useful, at best, on rare occasions.

FlicSingles are a cool concept, offering a great entry point into smart-home experimentation for new users. Although not all of the current devices impress, I'm excited to see how the concept grows and whether new FlicSingles join the roster."
Kwikset Kevo Bluetooth Deadbolt (2016) review:|"

In 2013, Kwikset teamed with Unikey to bring touch-to-unlock smarts to your front door. The product was the  	Kwikset Kevo, a Bluetooth-enabled deadbolt that pairs with your phone and unlocks with just a tap when it detects you standing outside. It was a legitimately cool glimpse at a key-free future, but a high price tag and concerns about the physical security of the deadbolt made it tough to recommend.

Three years later, Kwikset is back with a second-gen Kevo. It's essentially the same touch-to-unlock smart lock as before, albeit with a couple of subtle yet important improvements. For starters, it's sturdier and more thoughtfully designed, with an interior housing that's much smaller than last time. It's stronger, too -- you can't force it open with the same brute attack that works on version one. And, in an especially welcome change, the ""eKeys"" that grant others access to your door are now free and unlimited.

All of that makes for a better Kevo, but at $230, it's even more expensive now than it was three years ago. On top of that, the second-gen smart lock also excludes a $25 key fob accessory that originally came included -- so you're getting less hardware for more money. The Kevo is still legitimately cool, but you need to  	really want that touch-to-unlock convenience in order to justify buying one.

Before you buy this smart lock or any smart lock, you're going to want to take a good look at your door. Lock it and unlock it a couple of times. Did you need to push or pull on the doorknob in order for the bolt to turn smoothly? If so, you'll need to realign the door, because smart locks can't hold the door in place as they turn the lock like you can.

You'll also want to take a look at your door's design. If it's cut to hold  a mortise-style lock, for instance, then the Kevo won't fit. Most more traditionally-styled doors should work, but download the Kevo app and check your measurements before buying just to be sure. This would also be a good time to check compatibility with your phone, especially if you're an Android user -- Kevo only works with Android 5.0 and higher.

If everything checks out, then rest assured that installing the Kevo is a pretty simple process. In most cases, all you'll really need is a screwdriver and about 15 minutes. The app is helpful here, with detailed, step-by-step instructions and easy-to understand animated illustrations. The second-gen lock is also designed for an easier installation than ever, with color-coded insides and a single-cable connection between the interior and the exterior. Credit to Kwikset.

Once it's installed in your door, the Kevo looks more or less like any other standard deadbolt you might use. It's plain and inconspicuous, only lighting up when you touch it. I'm a fan of the low-key design, as the thought of bolting flashy, expensive-looking tech to the exterior of my home gives me pause. And, with three different finishes to choose from, you shouldn't have any problem picking a Kevo that'll blend in with your home's decor.

In addition to locks at the CNET Smart Home and the CNET Smart Apartment, I installed a second-gen Kevo on the back door at my own home in Louisville, Kentucky. It's the door I go in and out of each day when I leave for work and when I come home, and I wanted to get a sense of what the Kevo could offer my day-to-day.

I started by pairing it with my phone. With the app running in the background on your Android or iOS device, the Kevo will detect when you're outside. Then and only then will touch-to-unlock let you in.

Except it didn't. At the start of my tests, I had just upgraded to the newly released iOS 10, and iOS 10 launched with tweaks to how devices connect over Bluetooth. As a result, iPhone users needed to have the app open in the foreground before the lock would let them in. I stuck with the key.

Fortunately, subsequent iOS updates corrected the Bluetooth issue, and within a few days I was able to start using touch-to-unlock like normal. It worked reliably well over the rest of my week of tests, and never failed to let me in. The only exceptions were a handful of times where I had to tap on the lock two or three times before it'd open -- it's picky about your phone's specific location.

The reason for that is a good one. It's not enough just to be in wireless range of the lock -- the Kevo needs to know that your phone is outside of the door. Otherwise, anyone could tap to unlock your door any time you left your phone, say, sitting on a table just inside.

The downside is that the lock takes a few seconds to think before letting you in, and sometimes, won't let you in on the first touch at all. And, of course, you won't be able to tap your way inside if you leave home without your phone, or if your battery dies. For these reasons, you'll still want to keep the key on your keychain.

Your other touch-to-unlock option is to use the Kevo's fob accessory. It's a small bit of black plastic that clips to your keychain, and it houses its own Bluetooth radio. Pair it with the lock, and you'll be able to use it in place of your phone to get touch-to-unlock working.

I like the fob. In fact, I prefer it. With the fob, there's no worry about a software update messing things up the way iOS 10 initially did, and no concerns about other paired devices interfering with your connection, either. It's a dedicated link between you and the lock, and in my tests, it worked just as well as my phone did.

The only problem? The fob doesn't come included. It did in generation one, but now, you'll need to pay an extra $25 for it on top of the $230 that you're already spending on the lock itself.

As said earlier, the app does a nice job walking you through the installation process. After you install the lock, you probably won't need the app very much. You can use it to lock and unlock the door remotely (provided you're within Bluetooth range), but I never had reason to do so during my day-to-day tests. If you want to connect to the lock from beyond Bluetooth's limited range, you'll need to purchase the $100 Kevo Plus plug-in gateway to get the lock on your WiFi network.

The real post-installation purpose of the app is to help you manage multiple users. You'll do so using what Kwikset calls ""eKeys."" Send one to a friend's email address, and they'll be able to sync their phone up with the lock, too. From there, they'll be able to use touch-to-unlock to get inside, and you'll be able to see when they come and go in the app's history section.

eKeys come in three varieties: Anytime eKeys, Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys. Like the name suggests, Anytime eKeys will work indefinitely until you revoke access. Guest eKeys are just Anytime eKeys that only work for 24 hours, then expire. Scheduled eKeys come with optional schedule restraints -- you can give them an expiration date, or restrict them to work only on certain days or at certain times.

Best of all, Kwikset no longer charges you $2 per eKey. All three varieties are now completely free and unlimited -- a definitive win for the user base.

On the smarts front, I was underwhelmed with the Kevo's third-party integrations. Despite being around for three years, the Kevo doesn't work with any larger home automation platforms, and instead, only connects directly with the Nest Learning Thermostat and with video doorbells from Skybell and Ring. Competing smart locks do better, especially the August Smart Lock -- in addition to Nest, it also works with Apple HomeKit and the Amazon Echo smart speaker to let you lock the door using a Siri or Alexa voice command.

The recent addition of an IFTTT channel for the Kevo helps, though. An acronym for ""if this, then that,"" IFTTT is a free online automation service that connects things that don't work together otherwise. With the Kevo, you can trigger IFTTT-compatible devices and services each time your door is locked or unlocked (you can also limit those triggers to only fire when a specific person uses the lock.) For instance, you could create an applet on IFTTT that turns your Lifx smart LED bulbs on each time you unlock the door.

One last thing: This is a stronger, more secure deadbolt than generation one, which, three years ago, we showed was susceptible to a specific brute-force attack that uses a screwdriver and a tension wrench to force the lock to turn.

That's not the case any more. For generation two, Kwikset made sure to address the vulnerability -- even going so far as bringing the independent security expert who discovered it, Marc Weber Tobias, on as a consultant to help correct it. A vocal critic of the deadbolt used in the first Kevo, Tobias now calls it one of the most secure locks on the market, and even told me that he uses one in his own home when I spoke with him on the phone.

We didn't just take his word for it, though (he's on the Kwikset payroll now, after all). Instead, we broke out the toolbox and tried the technique out for ourselves, just like we did with the first-gen Kevo. CNET technical editor and all-around handyman Steve Conaway made the brute-force entry look easy three years ago -- but this time, he wasn't successful. The lock didn't give one bit, no matter how hard he tried.

In addition to the sturdier design, the SmartKey deadbolt inside of the Kevo is nearly impossible to pick, with very high ratings from independent testers and security experts. It's also designed to prevent lock bumping, a popular and alarmingly easy way of forcing cheap locks open.

On the cyber front, Kwikset uses end-to-end encryption for all of the lock's wireless transmissions, and doesn't connect to the cloud at all unless you purchase the Kevo Plus Wi-Fi extender. It would take a very skilled, very determined hacker to trick it into opening, and they'd need to be within Bluetooth range to do so.

If I had to pick a smart lock for my door right now, I think I'd go with the second-gen Kwikset Kevo. It isn't as well-connected as smart locks that are designed to work with larger home automation platforms, and it doesn't quite get us to the key-free promised land, but it's still a unique and futuristic gadget that works as promised. Touching to unlock is convenient, unique, and undeniably cool -- the charm of it never really wore off during my multitude of tests.

Still, $230 is a painful premium for an upgraded deadbolt, and it's more than the original Kevo cost despite the fact that the key fob accessory no longer comes included. I like this lock a lot, but I don't think I'd pay more than $200 for it.

EDITOR'S NOTE, 3/3/17, 4:10 PM: Since publishing this review, Kwikset eliminated the $2 fee to send someone an Anytime or Scheduled eKey. The text has been updated accordingly, and the Kevo's score has risen from 7.9 to 8.1 out of 10."
Haiku Home Haiku Light review:|"

There are plenty of smart lighting options that you can control with an app or even with your voice, but you'll find few perfect solutions for smartening up an all-in-one, built-in recessed fixture. In many cases, there might not be any bulb at all to swap out, and most smart switches won't let you dim the lights.

Enter Haiku Home, the smart home division of Lexington Kentucky's Big Ass Solutions (known best for its eponymous Big Ass Fans). In addition to smart ceiling fans, the brand offers high-end indoor/outdoor recessed lighting fixtures with connected smarts. Along with flipping the switch like normal, you can control them using the Haiku app, using the same remotes and smart switches that control Haiku fans, or by connecting them with Amazon's Alexa for voice-activated lighting changes. They'll also change between warm and cool color temperatures, and turn on and off automatically based on motion below.

The Haiku Lights don't come cheap, starting at $149 a pop. But they look terrific and work exceptionally well, offering seamless smarts for high-end smart homes. If you're looking for something luxurious, or if you've already bought into the Haiku ecosystem with a ceiling fan or two, then they deserve some consideration.

We installed several Haiku Lights in the CNET Smart Home to test out their connected capabilities. And, by and large, they're some of our favorite things in the place. The motion sensors are swift and responsive -- whenever one of us walks in through the garage, a light in the entryway ""sees"" us and lights up the entire hallway for us. After two minutes of inactivity (you can customize this length in the Haiku app on your Android or iOS device), they dim back down, ready to light up again whenever someone passes through.

That sort of ""set-and-forget"" approach is the Haiku Light's strongest asset. It's been months since I programmed these things, and they've worked perfectly ever since. None of us have needed to use the app for anything. They just work.

Of course, you can still turn the lights on and off at the switch like normal -- doing so won't reset any of your settings. There's also a handy little remote that'll let you control any individual light you point it at. And, if you're an Amazon Echo user, you can ask Alexa to turn the lights on and off, or dim them up and down. They're compatible with the Nest Learning Thermostat  -- though Haiku's integration is obviously geared more towards its ceiling fans.

They're also nice and bright. Haiku pegs them at a healthy 1,348 lumens each, which is roughly halfway between a 75 and 100W bulb. Couple that brightness with the circular overhead design, and you get a nice, even dispersion of light from each one, and more than enough brightness for most needs (we typically keep the ones in the CNET Smart Home dialed down to about 50 or 60 percent).

Haiku's lights come in five different finishes, and prices vary depending on which style you choose. Standard white and black ""Select"" models come cheapest at $149 if you're willing to pass on color tunability and stick instead with a single, yellowy tone of light. For fifty dollars more, you can go with a ""Premier"" model -- that'll add in the cool, bluish white, daylight end of the spectrum, and let you dial in on your exact white light shade of choice.

For an additional $125, you can also pair your lights with a Haiku Wall Control. A somewhat odd-looking little switch, the Wall Control can pair with several lights at once (and with Haiku's smart ceiling fans) to offer a dedicated control point for everything. It also packs an additional motion sensor -- a handy way to, say, trigger the lights at the top of the stairs as you approach from below.

Handy as it may be, the Wall Control is a pure extra. Skipping it won't cost you any connected features.

As for security, Haiku's team tells me that they protect their products from malicious attacks using industry-standard end-to-end encryption. The lights don't use the kinds of hard-coded, default passwords that make devices vulnerable to a DDOS attack like the one from a few weeks ago that brought much of the internet to a standstill. They also require a secure home connection, and don't allow users to access their lights from outside of it. That's a bit limiting if you want to be able to control your lights when you aren't home, but the fact that you can schedule them, or set them to turn off automatically when motion stops helps mitigate things somewhat.

I can't afford to fill my home with these lights, but if I could, I'd be tempted. They look terrific and work well, offering true set-and-forget intelligence. The addition of built-in, super-reliable motion detection helps them justify the cost somewhat, and native compatibility with Alexa is a nice cherry to top things off.

Still, you don't need to pay this much for smart lighting. If your overhead lights allow you  to swap out the bulb, you can save money by going with LED floodlights from Philips Hue or Lifx, both of which are just as compatible with Alexa as Haiku is. The same goes for Stack's LED floodlights -- and on top of that, they include built-in motion detectors of their own. If bulbs aren't an option, then consider upgrading your light switches -- Lutron Caseta switches would be my recommendation, since they work with both Alexa and Siri, and, unlike a lot of smart switches, let you dim the lights, too. All of those worthy alternatives cost less per light than Haiku.

None of them are quite as classy as Haiku, though, and since lighting is an ever-important part of home decor, that's worth considering. Bottom line: they're priced like high-end lighting products because they are high-end lighting products. If they fit into your aesthetic (and your budget), then splurge with confidence."
Nanoleaf Aurora review:|"

Triangular, color-changing LED light panels you can control on your Android or iOS device, or by using spoken commands: That's the pitch for Nanoleaf Aurora, one of the most design-centric devices for the connected home that we've ever seen.

This isn't your typical smart-home gadget. It doesn't promise to make your life more convenient or your home more comfortable. It isn't even a very practical light source. Instead, Nanoleaf Aurora is a design play for the connected living space. It wants your smart home to express itself.

And you know what? All of that is fine. People buy pretty things to hang up on their walls all the time -- so why not a pretty-looking smart light setup?

At $200 (about £165/AU$260), the nine-panel Nanoleaf Aurora starter kit doesn't come cheap. But it isn't outrageously expensive, either, especially when you consider how eye-popping these panels are -- or that the cost is roughly as much as you'd pay for a three-bulb  	 	Philips Hue starter kit.

Like those Philips Hue bulbs, the Aurora panels work with Apple HomeKit, the smart home standards built into iPhones and iPads that run the latest iOS software. HomeKit lets you toggle your lights and devices right from your phone's Control Center or by using spoken Siri commands, and the Aurora panels do an outstanding job of putting it all to work. Compatibility with Amazon's Alexa is coming by the end of this year, too, so you'll soon have a second means of voice control.

All of it adds up to a cutting-edge in-home experience for out-and-proud smart home enthusiasts. You don't need these things on your walls -- nobody does -- but it's tough to deny that they make a pretty compelling case for novelty smart lighting.

If you're a fan of classic sci-fi, or if you just watched a lot of cartoons as a kid, then maybe these things look familiar. Color-changing light panels have been a mainstay of faux-futuristic pop culture for decades now, lighting up countless spaceships, alien bases, and dwellings of tomorrow. Now, Nanoleaf thinks it's time these panels lit up your living room, too.

And why not? They look terrific, thanks to a design that leans on a modular build, geometric simplicity and bold, vivid colors, all of which combine to offer a wide range of display options.

You can connect any panel to any other panel using an SD card-like connector chip to join their sides. Power flows through all of them from the base attachment, which can handle up to 30 panels. If you want more than the starter kit's nine panels, extras are available in three-packs for $60 each (about £50/AU$80).

Setting everything up is a bit of a delicate process. Those connector chips don't feel terribly sturdy and they don't snap into place. As I hung everything, I worried that I wasn't using enough of the included sticky tabs to keep everything snug and secure.

Nanoleaf doesn't provide a whole lot of guidance as far as best mounting practices go; it pretty much just tosses you an envelope of those sticky tabs and say, ""Have fun!"" Everything stayed on the wall for the duration of my tests, but I still would have appreciated some more specific instructions.

That said, I was beyond impressed with these panels once I had them up and running. They're plenty bright (about 100 lumens per panel), the hues are vivid and true, and the preprogrammed, color-changing scenes look great (you can make your own in Nanoleaf's app, too). They made a strong first impression on just about everyone who saw them, including co-workers of mine who think color-changing smart lights are kind of dumb.

With the Aurora panels affixed to your wall, your next step is to download the Nanoleaf app to sync them up with your phone. Doing so is pretty painless. The base station broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal when you plug it in. You connect to that signal in your phone's settings, then sync it up with your own home network, all of which meet   Apple HomeKit's rigorous security protocols.

"" data-image-credit=""Ry Crist/CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""nanoleaf-in-app-and-on-wall.jpg"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""Nanoleaf in app and on wall"" data-image-filename=""nanoleaf-in-app-and-on-wall.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2016/11/02"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""1074"" data-image-width=""2048"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark="""" data-lightbox="""" data-parallax="""">

From there, the app will walk you through its controls. Your panels will appear in the app exactly as you have them arranged on your wall. You can tap on an individual panel to change its brightness or color, or you can pick a ""palette"" of colors for the panels to draw from using whatever transitional animation you select. Color changes can sweep across your setup from panel to panel, fade in and out for a breathing effect, or burst out randomly at various spots. You can control the speed of all of these transition effects, along with fine details like direction and smoothness.

Once you've designed a light pattern that you like (animated or otherwise), you can save it as a scene. It'll join those pre-configured Nanoleaf scenes in the app -- you can trigger any of them with a tap on your phone, or by asking Siri to run it if you're using an iPhone, a la ""Hey Siri, set the Forest scene.""

You can also cycle through all of them by pressing a button on the base attachment (and yes, you can delete those pre-configured Nanoleaf scenes in case there are any you don't want).

Nanoleaf's app also lets you see and control other HomeKit-compatible smart lights -- an advantage of the standardization HomeKit offers. That includes color controls for Philips Hue bulbs. Group bulbs like those into the same room as your Aurora panels, and you'll be able to tell Siri to change everything's color all at once using a command like, ""Siri, set the bedroom lights to green.""

You can also control the Aurora panels directly from Apple's dedicated Home app for HomeKit. You can't create patterns or adjust individual panels, but you can adjust the overall color and brightness of your setup, or tap to run a scene you've already created in the Nanoleaf app. On top of that, you can pin those scenes into the HomeKit section of your iPhone's Control Center for a speedy way to switch scenes on the fly. All of it, including the Siri controls, worked perfectly throughout all of my tests.

I'd like to see even more features for Aurora. The first one that jumps to mind is a music-syncing mode in which the panels would change colors in rhythm with whatever tunes you're listening to. That seems like a no-brainer for a design-oriented, party-friendly setup like Aurora, but you won't find it anywhere in the Nanoleaf app. Here's hoping Nanoleaf changes that with an app update in the not-too-distant future.

Another feature I'd like to see is a wake-up mode. Though you can schedule the Aurora panels to turn on and off at specific times, you won't find many options for customizing those lighting changes. You can't, for instance, schedule the panels to gradually fade on over the course of an hour at 6 a.m. each day.

That's a trick I use with a color-changing   Lifx smart bulb in my bedside lamp, and it makes it a lot easier to get out of bed in the morning. To their credit, Nanoleaf tells me we can expect to see a sunrise/sunset feature in the app within the coming weeks.

Additional platform compatibility would help bolster Aurora's case, too. Alexa controls are already on the way, with a skill for Amazon's virtual voice assistant due out by the end of the year. Nanoleaf's team also has Google Home on their radar and says that they'll make an integration happen ""whenever the new smart speaker is ready.""

I'd also like to see an Aurora channel on IFTTT. This would let people trigger lighting changes using things like GPS location, important notifications, weather and other IFTTT-compatible smart home gadgets.

The future is bright for these colorful smart panels. There's really nothing else quite like them. They won't fit with every aesthetic, but they're still versatile enough to offer broad appeal. Art lovers could have a field day decorating their apartments with them. Parents could use them as the ultimate nightlight for their kids. College football fans could set them to shine the school colors in a man cave or a game room.

They also take full advantage of what Apple HomeKit brings to the connected living space. Aurora is better because of HomeKit -- and HomeKit is better because of Aurora, too. That's the kind of smart-home symbiosis that's worth buying into.

Above all else, Nanoleaf's Aurora panels are   fun. They take the novelty of color-changing smart light and run further with it than Hue, Lifx or anything else ever has. I'll admit it. I kind of want them."
Netatmo Presence review:|"

I have conflicting feelings about Netatmo's $300 Presence outdoor security camera and LED light fixture.

While I'm nearly sold on the Presence's motion capabilities, I'm just not ready to drop 300 bucks on a single outdoor security camera -- especially if it doesn't have much overlap with the broader smart home market. Its design wouldn't work with my more traditional-looking home, either.

If the price and strong design don't scare you off, Netatmo's Presence could work for you. I'd take a look at some other options before you buy, though.

Like the $200 Kuna Light Fixture, Netatmo's Presence pulls double duty as both a security camera and a floodlight. Weatherproofed and rated for outdoor use, this heavy, rectangular hybrid device has to be hardwired to work properly. As always, be sure to reach out to a professional electrician if you have any questions.

The easiest install method is to ditch one of your existing outdoor wall lights and replace it with a Presence. For the 100-degree field of view Presence camera to work optimally, I'd only install it where you'd typically put a porch light and leave any security lights far above eye level alone.

If you're familiar with this type of install, it should be fairly simple, but it works best with two people; you need someone to hold the camera and someone else to connect the wires. Netatmo provides a wire terminal so you can more easily connect everything, but the ports were much too small to fit the larger wires we had at the CNET Smart Home. So, I had to remove the wire terminal and use wire nuts to connect everything instead.

I ran into an issue with the length of the wires here -- they're extremely short and it was difficult to connect the wire nuts and tuck them into the terminal box without everything disconnecting. Eventually, I called for reinforcements and our technical editor, Steve Conaway, got everything connected in about 30 minutes. If you include my initial effort, the total time spent on the Presence install was close to an hour and a half.

Once the Presence is installed, download the related Netatmo Security Android or iPhone app. Create an account and follow the step-by-step tutorial to pair the camera. Assuming everything is installed correctly, the app will scan for the camera, ask you to connect to the local Wi-Fi network and name your camera -- then you're ready to start live streaming.

The good stuff: It's a highly capable 1080p live video streamer with advanced analytics that correctly labeled motion activity as a car, a person or an animal most of the time. Its internal 16GB microSD card  makes event-based video recording a breeze.

The not-so-good stuff: The Presence is really expensive and Netatmo went bold with its design -- if you don't fancy the modern aesthetic, you won't like the way it looks. It's also light on smart home partners, only featuring support for online connection service IFTTT at launch.

Here's an overview of the Netatmo Presence's main specs and features:

Throughout testing I received prompt notifications alerting me to the specific type of motion the camera detected. Almost every time, Presence accurately identified motion as a person or a car (or a person and a car). Once, however, when producer Chris Monroe and I were standing within the camera's field of view, it told me it had detected a person...and an animal. Oops.

Generally, though, this feature worked quite well.

And, you can customize when and how you use the floodlight portion of the Presence. Not only can you turn it on or off and dim it on-demand, you can also program it to turn on when it's dark -- or when it's dark and it detects a specific motion, or any motion.

As far as third-party integrations go, Netatmo is supposed to have IFTTT support at launch. (As of today, November 2, you can buy the Presence at Home Depot, Apple and on Amazon.) I did try unsuccessfully to connect the camera to IFTTT a day early, but will give it another go soon to confirm that it's working.

IFTTT is a good start, but I'd like to see even more connected home partnerships with Presence. Apple HomeKit, a software platform that lets you control devices with Siri, announced support for security cameras back in June. Presence competitors Kuna and Toucan have been similarly slow to adopt smart home partners, though.

Netatmo's $300 Presence outdoor security camera and floodlight is a curious product. It offers advanced motion detection and a simple local storage solution -- all for free. (Whereas Nest makes you pay a monthly fee for its ""Person Alerts."") The ability to distinguish between a car pulling up and a person wandering around could prove very useful when you're looking out for potential burglars.

At the same time, the upfront cost is high and I wish Netatmo had more smart home integrations and offered additional designs to coordinate with more homes.  Netatmo's Presence does work well, but the $200 Kuna Light Fixture is available in different styles and it does something similar (minus the advanced motion algorithm) for less. I'd suggest taking a look at both before you make a final decision.

Honeywell Lyric T5 review:|"

While Nest was busy rolling out next-gen versions of what is essentially the same $250 thermostat, Emerson, Ecobee and now Honeywell were hard at work developing connected models with major smart-home partnerships that cost significantly less money.

Honeywell's Lyric T5 is the least expensive Wi-Fi thermostat I've reviewed to date at $150, a whopping 100 bucks less than Nest. It works with Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa and it has geofencing functionality. Bonus: Honeywell says its updated Lyric app offers ""improved [geofencing] performance"" and I have to agree. The T5's geofencing feature worked flawlessly for me during testing.

The outdated font on the thermostat's display may look like something straight out of the 1995 Sandra Bullock thriller ""The Net,"" but I like everything else about it -- especially the price. Definitely consider Honeywell's Lyric T5 if you're on the hunt for a more affordable smart thermostat with solid performance.

There are dozens of different home HVAC systems, wiring arrangements and settings. Ask a professional or a DIY-savvy friend if you have any questions about your specific setup. That said, Honeywell's Lyric T5 is really easy to install if you already have a C-wire configuration. Not sure? Check out Honeywell's Quick Install Guide for more details.

If you already have a C-wire in place and are lucky enough not to have to drill additional holes in the wall or repaint any newly-exposed areas, you can get this thing up and running in 10-15 minutes. After that, download the Android or iOS Lyric app and either create an account or use existing credentials to log in to your account.

The app takes the pairing process step-by-step. Just pick ""Lyric T5"" from the ""Select a device to install"" page in the app and answer the questions that follow to make your way through the configuration. At one point, it will transition to selecting options on the thermostat itself -- that's where you'll start to get a feel for the touchscreen.

Like I said in the intro, the font and general layout of the thermostat display is a little wonky. I don't exactly dislike it, but it looks dated. I wasn't quite sure how it worked right away, either, because a modern touchscreen combined with a screen that looks like it was ripped from the early PC days is an odd juxtaposition. But once you get used to it, it's responsive and easy to use.

If you want, you can stop there and simply use the app to create custom  schedules for 7-day programming  (you can also create  schedules directly on the thermostat), adjusting the temperature  on-demand anywhere you have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection.

But you can also turn on Apple HomeKit, an option that lets iPhone users  control the thermostat with Siri and geofencing, an option that uses mapping software to let  you set a radius around your house. That radius acts as a Home/Away threshold tied to your phone's GPS location. When you leave, the thermostat should automatically switch to Away mode. And when you come back it should automatically switch back to Home mode.

Both HomeKit and geofencing are optional, but are easy to configure directly within the app. They worked well, too. With HomeKit, you can ask Siri to, ""Set the CNET Thermostat (the name I gave the T5 in the app) to 70 degrees"" and other related commands and she'll oblige. The same is true for geofencing.

Unlike the $200 Honeywell Lyric thermostat, which will continue to sell in stores and had very spotty geofencing functionality when I tested it, the Lyric T5 was responsive and accurate -- I got alerts every time I crossed in and out of the threshold I set, and the Home and Away temperatures it automatically defaulted to were consistently correct.

Note that geofencing performance can vary based on your location, cellular carrier and other factors. A Honeywell representative told me, ""The latest version of the Lyric app features updated Geofencing features, including the addition of a sleep setting, improved performance and triggering and enhancements to save battery life on mobile devices."" Based on my experiences with the Lyric T5, I do feel like geofencing performance has improved, but it's difficult to say how well it will work for every user.

One key reason I see the Lyric T5 as a better value than the similarly priced Emerson Sensi and Ecobee3 Lite relates to its geofencing capabilities. Where the Sensi and the Ecobee3 Lite are essentially programmable thermostats with related apps and third-party integrations, the T5 is a programmable thermostat with a related app, third-party integrations and geofencing. That puts it more in line with pricier thermostats like Honeywell's higher-end Lyric thermostat, the Ecobee3 and Nest -- all models that offer some sort of ""smarts"" that allow for more advanced automations.

If that wasn't enough, the Lyric T5 also works with Amazon Alexa products. So, if you happen to have an Echo, an Echo Dot or a Tap lying around, you can enable the Lyric Skill in the Alexa app and go about voice control that way. Like HomeKit, just say, ""Alexa, set the CNET Thermostat to 68 degrees."" Occasionally she didn't hear me clearly, but it worked most of the time.

Honeywell says an IFTTT channel is in the works, but I'd like to see even more integrations -- Samsung SmartThings, Wink and Google Home would help round out the Lyric T5's smart home partnerships.

For the first time since Nest introduced its inaugural Learning Thermostat in 2011 (now in its third iteration), the smart heating and cooling innovator has some serious catching up to do.

Sure, Honeywell's $150 Lyric T5 is just one connected thermostat, but its relative affordability is hard to overlook and it's the third manufacturer I know of to offer a less expensive smart alternative. If I can get Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa compatibility, as well as impressive geofencing performance from a model that costs $100 less, why would I pay for Nest? That question is becoming increasingly relevant, but Nest's Google Home integration could buy the startup-turned-Alphabet-brand some time.

I still prefer Nest's design and usability over all other connected thermostats, but the Honeywell Lyric T5 is my current favorite in the market for its smart integrations, performance and overall value."
The Gate smart lock is a Swiss Army knife for home security|"

Why bother with a bunch of pesky accessories when you can have a single device do all of the heavy lifting? That's the idea behind Gate Labs' Gate smart lock. As a Wi-Fi deadbolt with a built-in keypad, camera, motion detector, speaker, microphone and ""call"" button, Gate promises to do much more than your standard app-enabled lock.

Gate is in the middle of an Indiegogo campaign, and the product has already raised more than double its original $70,000 funding goal. The $179 ""Super Early Bird"" price tier is sold out, but folks worldwide can still preorder Gate for $214, with shipping slated for March 2017 (roughly £175 and AU$280 at the current exchange rate). Given Gate's projected retail price of $300, that's still a decent discount for backers.

While we haven't seen a product quite like Gate, it does remind me of a fellow Indiegogo project -- the ill-fated Goji Smart Lock. We wrote about Goji back in 2013 when a connected lock was a pretty revolutionary idea, let alone one with an included camera. But roughly three years later, Goji's backers are still waiting for their product. That means Gate has the chance to be the first DIY smart lock-doorbell-camera hybrid to make it to the mass market.

So, what exactly are Gate's claims? Check out the rundown to the right, straight from the team's crowdfunding page. Basically, Gate Labs took cues from today's smart locks, smart doorbells and smart security cameras and designed a single product to perform all of those functions.

I like that Gate relies on a rechargeable battery rather than AAs a la August's Smart Lock, but I do question its battery life. August runs primarily on Bluetooth LE to conserve power, but it does give you the option to add in Wi-Fi connectivity via either a Connect module or August's Wi-Fi Doorbell Cam so you can access the lock outside of Bluetooth range as needed. Gate claims its rechargeable battery should last for up to four months, but that could easily vary depending on usage.

And, like other smart locks available today, Gate also comes with a companion app for remotely accessing your lock, the camera's live feed and the two-way talk intercom function.

As far as integrations with other manufacturers' products go, Gate Labs says the lock will work with Amazon Alexa, the online retailer's digital, voice-controlled assistant, so you can control the lock hybrid with voice commands. Gate Labs also plans to add HomeKit, Nest and IFTTT integration in the future. All of that sounds nice, but it isn't that simple. In particular, HomeKit products, which are powered with Apple's digital assistant, Siri, require a built-in chip that necessitates second-gen hardware. Most likely, that means early Gate adopters won't have that functionality unless they buy an updated version of the lock in the future, and there's no guarantee that Gate will make a second-generation of the lock.

We'll track the Gate's progress and try to get our hands on one next year. Stay tuned."
This cute li'l security camera means serious business|"

Security device manufacturer Ezviz may not be a big name in the smart-home space, but I found a lot to like about its ultra-affordable $70 Mini camera when I reviewed it last year.

Now the team is back with the $100 Mini Plus, a next-gen model that promises to be even better than the original Mini. Complete with 1080p high-definition live video streaming and a 135-degree-field-of-view lens, the Mini Plus boasts a better resolution and a larger viewing angle than its predecessor. It also works with IFTTT via the Ezviz channel, which gives you free rein to link your Mini Plus to Amazon Alexa products, connected LEDs and a smattering of other smart-home gadgets.

The Mini Plus does share a lot of similarities with the first-generation Mini (check out the video above for more details on the Mini). It comes with a microSD card slot if you favor local storage -- select the $120 option when you check out on Amazon, and you'll get a 16GB microSD card with your purchase. You can find Ezviz's Mini Plus at Home Depot, Best Buy and other chain retailers as well. And like the Mini, the Mini Plus does have a magnetic base for effortless mounting on a fridge, filing cabinet or another magnetic surface.

If local storage isn't your thing, you can opt in to Ezviz's event-based cloud subscription, CloudPlay. Unfortunately, prices have gone up to $6 per month/$60 per year for seven days of storage or $11 per month/$110 per year for 30 days of storage (the previous rate was from $5 per month/$50 per year for seven days and $10 per month/$100 per year for 30 days). You do get a month's worth of free seven-day cloud storage with the Mini Plus, but that's disappointing since Ezviz offered Mini customers a full year of free cloud services back in 2015.

Ezviz is clearly trying to become a more prominent name in the smart-home market, but I'm not totally sold on the Mini Plus over the last-gen Mini. You can still find the Mini on Amazon, currently for just $67.87, and it covers a lot of the same ground as the new version, just in 720p HD instead of 1080p. The IFTTT channel even works with the original Mini cam, so you aren't limited to the Mini Plus for connecting to smart products from other manufacturers. Ezviz does claim improved motion sensitivity with the Mini Plus, though, which would be a significant upgrade over the many phantom alerts I received with the Mini.

In addition to the Mini Plus, Ezviz has also rolled out two other cameras -- the $80 Mini O and the $130 Husky. The Mini O is a baby monitor with motion detection and HD resolution -- head over here to check out more of our baby monitor coverage. The 1080p HD Husky comes with a 16GB microSD card and is designed for outdoor use; Ezviz claims it works in the ""snow, rain, sun and heat.""

I'm tracking down review units of the Mini Plus and Husky cams now to see how these budget options compare to pricier DIY models."
iSmartAlarm's new camera will follow you wherever you may go|"

The majority of today's DIY home security cameras come with fixed wide-angle lenses. That means you can't pan or tilt them to capture motion happening outside of a specific field of view. But what if you want your camera to actually follow the action?

iSmartAlarm ($146.11 at Amazon.com) might have your fix. The security company is in the midst of an Indiegogo campaign for its latest device, the $200 iCamera Keep Pro -- an updated version of iSmartAlarm's first-gen iCamera Keep.

Available for preorder now on Indiegogo for the reduced price of $79 in the US and roughly £80 in the UK, iSmartAlarm expects to ship the earliest batches of iCamera Keep Pro's to US backers beginning in March 2017 (April for folks in the European Union).

Here's a rundown the iSmartAlarm iCamera Keep Pro's basic specs and features:

Everything in this list looks good, but iSmartAlarm certainly isn't the only company offering this sort of camera. Traditional internet protocol (IP) camera brands like Foscam have offered pan and tilt functionality for years.

The newer 360-degree Zmodo Pivot cam is also fairly similar to the iCamera Keep Pro. At $150, Zmodo's Pivot has 360 degrees of built-in motion sensors that detect activity even when the lens isn't pointed in the right direction. That's where its 360-degree panning capabilities come in -- the camera rotates to the right spot and records activity.

Interestingly, iSmartAlarm's Indiegogo page says, ""The iCamera KEEP Pro is the first DIY smart home security camera to offer Motion Tracking."" Its original iCamera Keep had the same pan and tilt capabilities as the new Pro version, but it wasn't able to follow activity automatically. That makes the Pro's motion tracking a first for iSmartAlarm, but I don't agree that it's new for the broader DIY security industry.

There's still a month left on iSmartAlarm's iCamera Keep Pro campaign and the team has already nearly doubled its original $50,000 funding goal. I've asked iSmartAlarm for a model to test out, so check back to see how it compares to Zmodo's Pivot.

Wink Hub 2 review:|"

Wink's Hub 2 gave me major deja vu. Not only does this slab of white plastic look very similar to  	the startup's first-generation Wink Hub, it also works roughly the same.

That means you'll run into occasional in-app glitches, latency issues and connectivity woes. And, priced at $99/£80/AU$130, this smart home gizmo also costs $20 more than the original version.

Yes, Wink has made some improvements over generation one. Hub 2 has more memory, supports Bluetooth, comes with an Ethernet port and works with dual-band Wi-Fi. But that isn't enough to recommend it over the interactive voice-control platforms that have emerged since from  	Amazon and Apple.

No one has found a truly engaging aesthetic for a smart-home hub and the white plastic Wink Hub 2 is no exception. While this model feels heavier and more durable than its predecessor, it isn't much of a design improvement. The two iterations have roughly the same measurements and they're, well, seriously boring-looking.

Instead, the most significant updates are hidden inside the hub itself. There you'll find 512 MB worth of memory (up from 64 MB), an Ethernet port for connecting the hub directly to your router and support for both 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi, as well as Bluetooth-enabled devices.

Here's a list of the automation languages Wink's Hub 2 works with:

Note: You can still buy the first-generation Wink Hub for $69/£55/AU$90 while supplies last.

All of those improvements are a step in the right direction, but I didn't notice any distinct differences between testing the first- and second-generation Wink Hubs.

The good news is that it's still (mostly) easy to pair devices. I connected a  	Nest Learning Thermostat, a Nest Cam Indoor, a Lutron Serena window shade and a Lutron Pico remote. I also connected to our Chamberlain MyQ Garage door opener account, but that product isn't currently installed at the CNET Smart Home so I couldn't actually control it.

Bluetooth LE Kidde Clear Connect Z-Wave ZigBee

Select ""Add a Product"" on the home screen and follow the detailed step-by-step instructions to connect that device.

This worked well, with one annoying caveat. I was having a lot of trouble connecting the Lutron Serena window shade and learned from a Wink representative that, ""Wink-compatible products connected to other smart home platforms will need to first be unpaired before they can be used with Wink Hub 2.""

Unpairing Lutron devices is extremely frustrating, since you have to triple press and hold the reset button and then quickly triple press it again. And if you don't get the timing just right, it won't work. It took me at least a dozen tries to reset it correctly. To its credit, the Wink app was clear about what I needed to do; it just wasn't easy.

Clicking on the ""Thermostats"" category or the ""Blinds"" category on the home screen would pull up the Nest thermostat or the Lutron Serena shade so I could view their current status and make any adjustments as needed. This worked pretty seamlessly, albeit with occasional lags.

The major problem I experienced related to Wink's robots or rules. These rules should let you create  	IFTTT-style automations like, ""If my Nest Cam Indoor senses motion, then my Lutron Serena shade opens.""  Not only did this not work once, I got a consistent ""500 Internal Server Error"" that made me think I hadn't successfully created the rule. But, as it turned out, I had actually created multiple versions of the same rule -- and not one of them was working. Bummer.

Of course, Wink's Hub 2 isn't the only hub that's run into trouble. We briefly championed Samsung's open-source SmartThings Hub, only to run into serious usability issues with the app. Insteon's Hub Pro and Iris by Lowe's also had some significant limitations.

And now, integrations via Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit make it possible to adjust the temperature of your thermostat, turn on lights, open shades and more all with a simple voice command to Alexa or Siri. I had high hopes for Wink's second hub, but Wink needed to go above and beyond to compete with the seamlessness of saying, ""Alexa, set my thermostat to 68 degrees."" Right now, it just doesn't -- especially since Wink increased the price of its hub from $80 to $99.

With platforms like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's HomeKit swooping in with comparatively easy and  	fun ways to communicate with smart home gadgets, it's hard out there for traditional hubs. Yes, Wink has an Alexa Skill and HomeKit-enabled devices like Lutron's Serena shades work with Wink, but the Hub 2 comes across as more of a intermediary, and one that overcomplicates more than it simplifies.

If Wink manages to work out some of its performance kinks, the Hub 2 would make a fine smart home unifier for app loyalists. But personally, I'd reach for a $50  	Amazon Echo Dot instead."
Ecobee3 Lite review:|"

I'm not saying $169 is cheap, but it's a darn good price in smart thermostat-land. There, Wi-Fi models regularly sell for over two hundred bucks and very few work with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Samsung SmartThings, Wink and  IFTTT.

That's where Ecobee's new Ecobee3 Lite Smart Thermostat comes in. Available beginning October 31 at Home Depot, Best Buy, Amazon and Ecobee's online store, the $169 Ecobee3 Lite is the least expensive Wi-Fi thermostat you can find today that supports five major smart home platforms.

So what's the downside? Like the $160 Emerson Sensi Wi-Fi Programmable Thermostat, the Ecobee3 Lite is only semi-smart -- it doesn't come with a remote sensor or any other advanced features. Instead, it bridges the gap between $100 app-enabled thermostats with no smart home integrations and $250 high-end models with smart home integrations and tech that learns your routine and makes automatic temperature adjustments.

The Ecobee3 Lite is easily the most appealing basic 7-day programmable thermostat on the market, one I can comfortably recommend. Just be sure to consider how much these connected home partnerships matter to you before you buy.

The Ecobee3 Lite looks identical to the brand's existing $249 Ecobee3 Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat. Both have a 3.5-inch glossy black digital display with a touchscreen interface, similar to a phone. Simply tap on the various options to change the temperature, view the current forecast, set schedules and otherwise adjust the settings.

It's worth noting that the layout on the Android and iPhone app mirrors the Ecobee3 Lite's hardware, so there's little-to-no learning curve on that front.

Overall, I like the look of this thermostat and its companion app -- it's particularly great if you're a fan of integrated touchscreen panels. Personally, I prefer more tactile displays with buttons or at least some sort of haptic feedback a la Nest's $249 Learning Thermostat. But the Ecobee3 Lite's interface is intuitive, easy to navigate and extremely responsive.

Always consult a professional if you have questions about installing a thermostat. But, if you're familiar with the general process, getting the Ecobee3 Lite up and running is pretty simple.

There's one caveat: The Ecobee3 Lite doesn't offer a rechargeable battery like Nest, so you'll need to have a C wire to power the digital display or install the included Power Extender Kit.

It took me roughly 15 minutes to replace a third-gen Nest thermostat with the Ecobee3 Lite at the CNET Smart Home. You may need to use a power drill to create new holes, though, and that could add time to your install.

To visualize the process, take a look at this install video of the Emerson Sensi thermostat. It won't be identical to the Ecobee3 Lite, but you'll get the general idea.

Once the thermostat is installed and powered on, you can start adjusting the temperature, programming scheduled temperature changes and more. But, you should also download the Ecobee app on your Android or iOS device for remote access to your heating and cooling. That way, you can make adjustments and check the status of your thermostat anywhere your phone has a solid cellular or Wi-Fi connection.

But there are also a bunch of smart home partnerships to try out; I tested Alexa and HomeKit integrations to see how Alexa and Siri voice control worked with the Ecobee3 Lite. The $249 Ecobee3 is also Alexa- and HomeKit-enabled, so everything worked pretty much the same.

For Alexa, make sure you have an Echo, Echo Dot or Tap, download the Alexa app and enable the Ecobee skill. Once that's set up, you can start asking Alexa to adjust the temperature for you. The same goes for Siri via HomeKit. To configure HomeKit, you can either follow the steps in the Ecobee app or use Apple's Home app, now available natively on iPhones thanks to iOS 10.

Everything I tested worked consistently well. The temperature changes kicked in promptly, the preprogrammed temperatures updated automatically and the automations I tested out were happily glitch-free.

Well, that depends. Ecobee's $169 Ecobee3 Lite Smart Thermostat is responsive, simple to program and seriously in tune with today's smart home market. If you already use or plan to start using Alexa, HomeKit, SmartThings, Wink or IFTTT, that's very good news. But if you aren't interested in asking Siri to change the temperature for you, a less expensive app-enabled model sans smart home partners will do the trick.

Are you intrigued by the Ecobee3 Lite, but not quite sold? Take a look at the $160 Emerson Sensi or the $149 Honeywell Lyric T5 (due out this month). Neither one has as many integrations as Ecobee, but both work with select smart home partners and offer related apps."
Let Netatmo coach you to a better home environment|"

Like Netatmo's first product -- the Urban Weather Station -- the Netatmo Healthy Home Coach is a cylinder that sits in your home and monitors the conditions around it. Announced today and available now, the $100 Healthy Home Coach tracks the same things as the indoor module of the Urban Weather Station -- air quality, humidity, temperature, and noise. But, like the name suggests, the Home Coach also offers advice based on what it senses about the conditions in your home.

According to Netatmo, the advice takes your specific family into account. For instance, if you have a baby, you'll be told if you're keeping your home too cold for the well being of the child. You'll be told to ventilate rooms if the air quality is poor. And you can monitor noise levels and the rest of these measurements in real time and see their recorded history in Netatmo's iOS or Android app.

You'll obviously need to tell Netatmo quite a bit about your family to get tailored advice, and I'm sure some parents will bristle at the idea that an app knows more about how to care for their child than they do. Knowing the conditions in a specific room can be quite helpful, but that's what the indoor module of the weather station is for. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why the Healthy Home Coach is being introduced as a new product rather than a software update to the existing app.

Still, if you just want an indoor module, the $100 Healthy Home Coach will save you money over the full $180 Urban Weather Station and maybe that's what Netatmo is doing here -- rereleasing the indoor module on its own at a discount with free advice packed in. That's fine, and since the Home Coach works with HomeKit, you can also ask Siri to check the status of your home.

Hopefully, you'll also be able to use the Home Coach to set up triggers via Apple's HomeKit app, so a fan automatically turns on if the air quality dips below a certain point. That's something we'll look for when we test it for a full review.

You can buy the Netatmo Healthy Home Coach now via the company's site as well as at Lowes, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Amazon. Again, it's $100 here in the US. In the UK, you'll be able to purchase it for £100 starting October 15 on Netatmo's site. The Healthy Home Coach is not available in Australia for now.

At the very least, I expect the Healthy Home Coach to take accurate readings -- the Urban Weather Station does. If the advice actually adds anything to the experience that a person with common sense couldn't figure out by looking at the readings, then the $100 price could be well worth it."
This smart doorbell doesn't have a security camera|"

You know the drill. Someone rings your doorbell when you aren't expecting it and you immediately enter stealth mode -- tiptoeing around to catch a glimpse of the person through a nearby window without them noticing you.

If it's a solicitor, you'll want to ignore it. But if it's a delivery person bringing that cute sweater you ordered from Asos a day earlier than anticipated, you'll want to answer. What to do, what to do...

A handful of enterprising startups are already working to solve this universal dilemma with the smart doorbell. A Wi-Fi-enabled gizmo you swap in where your old buzzer used to be, smart doorbells give you more ways to ""screen"" your front door without actually opening it.

The Ding Smart Doorbell, pre-orderable on Kickstarter beginning today for a minimum campaign contribution of  $119/£92 -- roughly AU$155 at the current exchange rate -- is simply the latest iteration of this connected doorbell trend.

Here's how the whole Wi-Fi doorbell thing has worked with all of the previous models I've tested:

Assuming the internet connection at your home and on your phone is solid, you should be able to do this whether you're snuggling on your couch 15 feet from your front door or on vacation a thousand miles away.

Ding is slightly different in that it doesn't come with a camera at all. Instead, when someone rings your front door, you'll get an alert and have the option to talk to the person from your phone via the related Android or iPhone app. This isn't quite as exciting as being able to spy on your guests without peering through a peephole, but it still gives you the flexibility to ask that delivery person to leave your sweater under the doormat.

I didn't find any mention of integrations with products from other manufacturers through IFTTT or another smart-home platform. Both Ring and SkyBell HD smart doorbells work with IFTTT, so that's a little disappointing.

You do have the option of either hardwiring the Ding Smart Doorbell or using battery power (Ding doesn't specify if it's a rechargeable or a replacement battery). Your purchase also comes with an accompanying door chime, appropriately dubbed Chime. Mount it on the wall in your house or set it on a flat surface and Chime will act as a supplemental doorbell alarm.

Ding's Kickstarter campaign began today, so there's plenty of time to buy in. The funding goal is $50,000, units can ship anywhere in the world, and they are expect to reach backers in August 2017."
A smart lock to keep people out of *that* drawer|"

Startup Smart Armor Tech is bringing the connected lock indoors. Instead of a standard deadbolt, the company has announced what it calls the Smart Cube -- a two-piece device that can lock indoor enclosures. Think of it like a retrofit home safe.

You won't use the Smart Cube on your front door like other smart locks, but the device grants the ability to secure a drawer in your dorm room, a cabinet of cleaning products where your young child likes to explore, or your liquor cabinet. It's a flexible product, and Indiegogo users -- who have contributed over $100,000 to the project so far -- seem excited about its potential. But I'm skeptical that those possibilities really merit the expected price tag: $100.

The Smart Cube basically looks like a bar with threading like a screw. This bar, which is only a few inches long, slides into a second piece -- a polycarbonate sheath. Users secure the sheath inside the cabinet or drawer, and attach the bar to the door. When it closes, the Smart Cube locks, securing the enclosure. To open it, you just tap a button in the Smart Armor app.

The mechanism is perhaps a little too simple. If you're really worried about keeping something out of reach, you probably want to buy a real safe. But its app connection does bring something unique to the table: you will receive alerts if a cabinet is opened or tampered with. This lets the device double as a door/window sensor and lock. The problem is, because it relies on Bluetooth technology, you won't be able to actually control the Cube while you're out of range. This limits the benefits of Smart Cube's connected-ness.

The basic idea for the device isn't bad, but between a slightly steep price and its Bluetooth limitations, the Smart Cube will have to do a lot to win me over. The Smart Cube is available for preorder on Indiegogo now, with devices planned to ship in early 2017."
Emerson Sensi review:|"

Emerson's Sensi Wi-Fi Programmable Thermostat doesn't rely on algorithms, remote sensors, geofencing or any other high-end smarts a la Nest's Learning Thermostat, Honeywell's Lyric or the Ecobee3. In fact, it's really just a basic-looking programmable thermostat with a related app. So, why should you buy it over the competition?

Let me count the ways:

If you're on the hunt for a thermostat upgrade, but don't want or need all of the fancy extras, the Sensi's semi-smartness still makes it much simpler to heat and cool your home. I definitely recommend it.

If I were to come across the Sensi on a store shelf alongside other connected thermostats, I would assume someone put it there by mistake. This thing is pretty utilitarian-looking. It's way better than the 20-year-old, barely functioning model in my house right now, sure, but decidedly lacking in the dazzling design department.

Since the advent of the Nest Learning Thermostat in 2011, a $249 smart model designed by two former Apple employees, a number of manufacturers have turned away from the practical rectangular white box look and have instead tried to add a dose of modern design into the mix.

Emerson didn't do that with the Sensi, but it isn't all bad news -- its buttons are responsive, its display is large and it's easy to read from a distance, as well as different angles. The app and Amazon Alexa integrations, too, are simple to configure and create a number of opportunities for remote access.

But before all that, you have to install your Sensi.

First stop? Check here to see if your wiring is compatible and be sure to visit Sensi's support page if you have installation questions. As always, consult a professional if you aren't comfortable going the do-it-yourself route, but a basic familiarity with thermostat wiring should have everything up and running in minutes. It took me roughly 10-15 minutes, but the holes in my wall from the old thermostat conveniently lined up with the Sensi's, so I took a slight shortcut.

Click through the gallery below for a tutorial on how to install a Sensi thermostat; this covers everything from removing your old thermostat to pairing the Sensi to the companion app.

It's affordable -- The Sensi is widely available at stores like Home Depot for $130 and on Amazon for just $104. Nest and other connected models cost as much as $249. Amazon's UK site lists Sensi for £341 through a reseller, so it's much cheaper and easier to find in the US. It's easy to use -- Both the thermostat and the app have thoughtful, logical layouts that make usability a breeze.It works with Amazon's Alexa -- You can pair any Alexa-compatible device with Sensi for fast voice control integration.

The Sensi may not track your home and away status and automatically make temperature changes on your behalf, but it's still pretty darn smart. Here's what you can do from the app's home screen:

Click on the upper left corner of the home screen to access the rest of the app's features. Not only can you set a custom schedule for every day of the week, you can also create separate schedules for different occasions, like vacation, summer -- whatever makes sense for your routine. You can also opt-in to email alerts to stay up-to-date on temperature extremes, maintenance requirements and usage details.

Everything worked reliably, with no issues along the way.

But, that's not all. the Sensi also has an Amazon Alexa Skill, meaning you can use your Alexa-enabled device or devices to control your thermostat with your voice. I snagged an Echo Dot from the office, logged in to the Alexa app and enabled the Alexa Skill (just type ""Sensi"" in the search field) and followed the few steps to connecting the two devices.

Five minutes later I was asking, ""Alexa, set My Thermostat (the name I gave my thermostat in the Sensi app) to 68 degrees"" and ""Alexa, lower My Thermostat by 3 degrees."" It worked fine, but I'd also like to be able to ask Alexa to switch between Heat and A/C modes.

The Nest Learning Thermostat and the Ecobee3 also have Alexa Skills, so the Sensi isn't exactly breaking ground here, but this is the least expensive retail-ready model we've come across to offer an advanced smart-home integration. The Sensi also works with the Wink Hub, but I didn't have a Wink handy to test out.

Honeywell's $149 Lyric T5 Thermostat, slated to hit stores in October, is supposedly compatible with both Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa. It should also have geofencing capabilities similar to the last-generation Lyric thermostats. Since that would give it more features and options than the Sensi for roughly the same price, we're keeping a close eye on the Lyric T5 and plan to test it soon.

Emerson's Sensi Wi-Fi Programmable Thermostat isn't perfect. I wish its looks were more in-line with today's modern, design-centric smart-home thermostats. I also wish it could do a bit more in terms of connected features. Still, this $130 thermostat -- available on Amazon for just $104 -- is a definite improvement over the most basic programmable models out there. If you're still undecided, I'd suggest waiting for our review of the Honeywell Lyric T5, particularly if you're a HomeKit fan.

Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation) review:|"

Apple is rumored to be working on a Siri-powered smart home speaker with built-in cameras. The Google Home smart speaker could go on sale as soon as tomorrow, October 4.

Alexa finally has some competition.

That's almost certainly why we have a second-gen Amazon Echo Dot. With the price slashed to a near-absurd $50 (or £50 in the UK, where  	 	Alexa launched just last month), Amazon's goal is obvious -- get its virtual voice assistant into as many homes as possible now, before people have other options. That means that the Dot is designed to sell, sell, sell. And to step all over the arrival of Google Home.

Not that it needed much help. The  	original Echo Dot, launched just last March as a pint-sized follow-up to the surprise smash-hit Amazon Echo smart speaker, was by all accounts just as successful as its predecessor. It sold out quicker than even Amazon had anticipated and won rave reviews, including an Editors' Choice distinction here on CNET.

Now, after being out of stock for months, the Dot is back, and more affordable than ever. (It isn't available in Australia, but were you to import one the price converts to about AU$65.) It's just as smart as before, too, with all of the same Alexa tricks along with plenty of new ones thanks to a rapidly growing library of third-party voice app ""skills."" And, despite the lower cost, it's an even better performer than the first generation, with microphones that do a better job of hearing your voice commands over music playback or background noise.

British skills include UK services like Sky News, The Guardian and National Rail as well as control of the British Gas smart home system Hive. Unfortunately, you can't filter skills by nationality in the Alexa app so British Echo owners have to scroll through irrelevant US skills to find ones that work in the UK.

In other words, the already-great Echo Dot got a compromise-free price cut. It was an Editors' Choice-winner back in March -- now, it's close to a must-buy for just about anyone who's reading this.

""Alexa"" is Amazon's cloud-connected, voice-activated virtual assistant. She's Siri in a speaker. You wake her up by saying her name, or by saying one of your two other wake word options, ""Amazon"" or ""Echo."" The array of microphones inside of the Echo Dot is always listening, and when they hear the wake word, they'll record whatever you say next and send it off through the cloud to Amazon's servers. Those servers will figure out what you're asking for, then tell Alexa how to respond. All of this happens in about a second.

You can ask Alexa to do all sorts of things. For starters, she can stream music from Amazon Prime Music, Pandora, or Spotify. She can can play podcasts from iHeartRadio or TuneIn. She can set kitchen timers. She can look up facts. She can wake you up in the morning. She can tell your kids painfully bad jokes. She can read off the day's headlines from whatever news sources you like (including, ahem, CNET). All you have to do is ask.

On top of that, Alexa keeps getting smarter thanks to  an increasingly robust market of third-party voice apps called ""skills."" There are over 3,000 of them at this point, and each one teaches Alexa a new trick. The Uber and Lyft skills let you tell Alexa to call you a ride. The Capital One skill lets you tell Alexa to make a credit card payment. The Domino's skill lets you tell Alexa to order a pizza. A skill called The Wayne Investigation lets you talk your way through an interactive mystery set in Gotham City. You can browse through them all in the Alexa app, then pick which ones you want to enable. You can also just ask Alexa to turn one on by saying something like, ""Alexa, enable the Jeopardy skill."" And, as of now, none of them cost anything.

Alexa can control a growing list of smart home gadgets, too, including  connected lighting setups, smart thermostats, and popular smart home platforms. Ask her to turn the kitchen lights off or raise the temperature a few degrees, and she'll happily comply. Here are some of the most popular options:

We've been using Alexa to control gadgets like these  in the CNET Smart Home for over a year now, and she's terrific at it. If you have any interest in smart home tech whatsoever, then the Echo Dot is an absolute no-brainer.

One of the challenges in launching the Echo in a range of countries is making sure Alexa understands different accents and knows when words are used in different contexts.

For example, sports fans can ask for the result of the latest ""Spurs game"". The US version of the Echo will know you probably mean the San Antonio Spurs and give you a basketball result, while the UK version knows you mean Tottenham Hotspur and gives you a soccer result. The UK version also gives you British English spellings and jokey Easter eggs relating to British cultural touchstones like ""Monty Python"", among a number of uniquely UK-focused features -- this video shows just some of those British features in action.

The new Echo Dot is a little shorter than the original because there's no longer a ring around the top that you turn to control the volume. Instead, you turn things up and down using two new volume buttons on the top of the device. It's also a bit lighter, with a glossy plastic casing instead of the matte black body of generation one. And, of course, it's available in white now (which looks quite good, in my opinion). Other than that, this is the same Dot as before: same plug-and-play simplicity, same voice-activated smarts.

Like every other Echo product, the Dot is really just an access point for the Amazon Alexa cloud platform. That means that you're getting the exact same Alexa features as you would with the full-size Amazon Echo or  the battery-powered Amazon Tap. The Dot just has a less powerful speaker.

There's an ace up the Dot's sleeve, though, and that's the fact that you can connect it with existing speakers and audio setups over Bluetooth or via line-in cable. Do so, and you'll essentially make an Echo out of whatever speakers you like. The Echo and Tap can't do that -- with both, it's the built-in speakers or it's nothing.

That makes Dot the most flexible of the three, and the most intriguing, too. After all, music is a big part of the Alexa experience, and most music lovers already have an audio setup they're happy with. The Dot lets them give that audio setup a brand new brain.

Just one, small quibble: Amazon doesn't include a line-in cable with the new Echo Dot like it did with the first one. You'll need to spend five or six bucks on your own (or dig one out of your junk drawer). It's a clear sign that Amazon was trying to get the entry cost as low as possible, and a forgivable omission given that you can still connect with external speakers right out of the box using Bluetooth. Still, I'd like it better if the cable came included.

So, the Dot is an Alexa access point, and a very clever one. But is it a good one? Specifically, can its microphones hear you as well as the ones in the full-size Echo? This was a small problem with generation one, especially during music playback, where I'd often need to shout to get Alexa's attention, even at close distances. Is the new Dot any better?

This was perhaps my biggest question about Dot 2.0, so I spent a lot of time testing it out side-by-side with the original Echo Dot in a variety of settings. Impressively, at every turn Dot 2.0 seemed to be a sharper listener than the first-gen Dot, with dramatically better performance during music playback.

Just watch the video above, where I see if the Dot can hear me over the sound of its own speakers playing a Wilco song at full blast. It's the same test that the first Dot basically flunked last March, even when I was just a few feet away. The new Dot heard me from 10 feet away or more almost every single time -- no shouting necessary.

But what about external speakers, ones with a lot more oomph than the Dot? What if your TV or stereo is blasting in the background? Well, take a look for yourself at how the new Dot fares compared to the old one:

Put frankly, the new Echo Dot demolished the first Echo Dot in my tests. It's a much better listener than before, and the significance of that improvement really can't be overstated. Like I've said, the Dot's primary job is to serve as an Alexa access point. Now, it's more accessible than ever.

That isn't to say that it's perfect. There were still times where it was basically unable to hear me -- usually when I sat it right next to a speaker blasting music at a loud volume. If you can put some distance between the Dot and your speakers -- even just a couple of feet -- you'll likely be fine, but if you plan on playing a lot of loud music, spending $30 on   a separate Alexa Voice Remote to control your setup would probably be wise. (Those remotes don't appear to be available outside of the US yet, but the price comes out to about £25 or AU$40.)

The next thing on Alexa's agenda is something called ""Echo Spatial Perception,"" or ESP. It'll come in the upcoming weeks by way of a software update for all of Amazon's Echo devices (including the full-size Echo and the first-gen Echo Dot), and it'll make it so that only the one that's nearest to you responds when you say the wake word.

It's an important part of  Amazon's master plan to get Alexa not just into every home, but into every room of every home. To that end, you can buy the Echo Dot in six- or even 12-packs at a buy-five-get-one-free discount. It's a bold strategy that could yield exponential growth if it works -- I've already had one friend tell me that he preordered a six-pack, with plans of keeping one and giving the other five out as stocking stuffers.

Amazon still has work to do with Alexa, though. For starters, Amazon's Echo products still can't wrangle whole-home audio across multiple devices. Amazon needs to fix that.  A planned integration with Sonos' multiroom audio systems will mark a big step towards that goal when it arrives next year, but ideally, Amazon will find a way to make it happen with Echo hardware alone.

There are also reports that Amazon is looking into  adding spoken push notifications into Alexa's repertoire -- potentially unprompted interjections to alert you about things like upcoming appointments or bad traffic conditions in the morning. I'd welcome the addition, so long as users get plenty of control over how often Alexa pipes up, if ever.

I also think Amazon could put the light ring on top of its Echo devices to good use here, with pulsing or even color-coded lights as a sort of silent indicator that Alexa has something to share. You could then say, ""Alexa, what's up"" to hear the notification at your convenience.

When Amazon designs a product, it likes to start by distilling the pitch into a single line. With the Kindle, that line was: ""Any book, anywhere in the world, in a minute or less."" With the Amazon Echo, the pitch was simply, ""A Star Trek computer for your home.""

Tack ""for 50 bucks"" (or ""for 50 quid"") onto that pitch, and you've got the Echo Dot. Amazon succeeded in making it more tempting than ever, perhaps irresistibly so. It's just as smart as the first version, and an even better listener -- all for less money.

The ball is now in Google and Apple's court, but both of those juggernauts sat out the first quarter. Amazon has a two-year head start on each of them, and it's taken full advantage of it by diversifying the Echo lineup and by bringing eager third parties into Alexa's fold at every turn. It's hard to imagine anyone overtaking that momentum with a single device, even Google or Apple.

So should you buy the new Echo Dot? Yeah, I think you should. It's delightful, it's cutting edge, and it's as good a value as you're likely to ever see in tech. It's the future, for $50 (or £50). How can you say no to that?"
Kuna Toucan review:|"

The $199 Toucan has a bunch of the basic outdoor camera stuff: HD video resolution, a motion sensor, alerts, a related app, two-way talk and cloud storage. But the best bit is that it also retrofits to existing outdoor wall lights via a USB cable, which means no batteries, no wires and no fuss. And since your purchase includes a Smart Socket adapter to make a dumb bulb smart, you can create rules in the Kuna app that link your camera to your light fixture.

I do wish its motion sensor were less sensitive and that the Toucan integrated with products from other smart-home companies. The Toucan doesn't have infrared LEDs for night vision, either. You have to rely on the illumination from the light fixture above instead. Even so, the Toucan is easy to recommend for its fast installation, unobtrusive USB cable, clear HD feed and the added bonus of a built-in 100-decibel siren to startle trespassers.

Housed in a circular, matte-black panel, the Toucan looks more utilitarian and discreet than the design-forward models out today like Nest Cam Outdoor. When you're talking about outdoor security devices, though, I'd likely opt for a Toucan's subtlety over a Nest's shiny white finish.

Beyond its unobtrusive aesthetic, the Toucan was also built to integrate with standard outdoor wall lights. And the team came up with a clever way to harness power from your light fixture so you don't have to install batteries in the camera or deal with wiring: a Smart Socket light bulb adapter and a small USB cable. That makes it much more low-maintenance than the battery-dependent Netgear Arlo outdoor cameras or the power-adapter-dependent Nest Cam Outdoor.

The complete installation took roughly 10 to 15 minutes. Here are the steps:

*The Smart Socket is 3 inches long and might be too big too work with your current light bulb and light fixture. In my case, the light bulb hung below the fixture.

**When you reinstall the wall light housing, make sure you feed the USB cable through the housing so it dangles down behind the wall light. A section of the USB cable is wrapped with a protective plastic cover to act as a cushion at the spot when the cable and the housing meet.

***When installing the Toucan camera, you can either use the included hardware or the strong adhesive backing; I used the sticker since my installation was temporary. Toucan also provides a conduit cover to hide any excess USB cable that might be dangling between the wall light and the camera's install spot. I stuck the camera directly under the light fixture, so I simply tucked the extra cable between the camera's base and face plate during installation.

Once you've installed the camera and flipped on power to the light, you should download the Kuna app for your Android or iOS device. Follow these steps to configure your Toucan using the app:

The app will then follow similar steps to connect the Smart Socket adapter.

Once you're inside the app, you can view your live feed in 720p HD as long as your Wi-Fi connection is solid. You can also control your wall light on demand or set rules that turn it on at dusk and off at dawn -- or at any time of day you choose. And, you can program the light to turn on temporarily whenever the camera detects motion. It even has a 100-decibel siren and prerecorded messages you can play to scare away potential intruders. All of this worked very well.

Motion-related video clips are accessible in the Recordings section of the app. If you don't pay for one of the subscription services, you still get a 2-hour grace period for viewing past history and downloading up to three clips per month.

You can also opt into motion-related push alerts and adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor as needed. This part didn't work all that well for me, though. Even after making adjustments in the app, I still had loads of video clips of tree branches swaying and my dog walking around. But it will capture everything, so at least you can be sure that the clip you need is there -- you might just have to search for it.

The Toucan doesn't work with any products from other smart-home manufacturers. It doesn't have an IFTTT channel, Amazon Alexa voice commands or integration with Apple's HomeKit and Siri, Samsung's SmartThings, Wink or Nest's Works with Nest platform. That makes it less appealing for anyone hoping to connect the smart products in their homes through a single platform.

It  doesn't have infrared-LED-enabled night vision, either. Instead, it uses light from the fixture above to capture events in low-light conditions. Since you can use up to a 75W bulb (or a roughly 1,100-lumen LED equivalent), that will probably be enough light to view the live feed and saved clips (it was for me). Still, it isn't ideal.

Even with the Toucan's limitations, this $199 camera is the DIY outdoor security product I've been waiting for in many ways. You don't have to mess with batteries or wires, it doesn't stand out, it isn't easy to steal if you mount it with the included hardware and it has simple app controls that pair smartly with lighting. Buy a Toucan if you want a simple way to watch over the exterior of your home. Just keep in mind that the motion alerts aren't always reliable.

Lifx White 900 BR30 Wi-Fi LED Smart Bulb review:|"

Cloud-connected light bulbs are a terrific starting point for the smart home, but most of your options are A-shaped bulbs meant for use in lamps. That's all well and good, but it isn't terribly helpful if you're living in a home filled with recessed lighting fixtures designed for BR30-shaped floodlights.

The good news is that you've got a couple of floodlight-shaped options, too. The best of the bunch? The Lifx White 900, a smart, Wi-Fi-enabled floodlight that lets you control things remotely through the Lifx app on your Android, iOS or Windows device. It won't change colors like other Lifx bulbs, but it will change color temperatures on the white-light spectrum, which allows you to dial between a warm, golden glow and bright, bluish-white daylight tones. On top of that, it enjoys all of Lifx' third-party integrations, which include  	IFTTT, the Nest Learning Thermostat and Amazon's Alexa. The cost? Thirty bucks a pop (a little less than £25, or about AU$40).

That's not inexpensive, but it is $20 less than  	Lifx' own color-changing floodlight, and $30 less than the Philips Hue floodlight. It's also just $10 more than bottom-tier smart floodlights from names like GE and TCP that don't offer white-light spectrum controls or the depth of Lifx' third-party connections. That, coupled with strong performance, puts the Lifx White 900 right in the smart-floodlight sweet spot.

Smarts aside, a connected light bulb has to start by being a good light bulb, especially if it's asking you to spend $30 on it. The Lifx White 900 passes this first test with ease. Like the name suggests, it puts out plenty of light, with a claimed 950 lumens at peak settings. That's a noticeable upgrade from the sort of 65W incandescent floodlight it seeks to replace -- bulbs like that typically put out less than 700 lumens.

The White 900 has a power draw of just 12 watts, so you're also getting a nice efficiency upgrade. How nice? In the US (energy rates will vary from region to region), a 12W bulb will add about $1.50 to your power bill each year, on average, which is far better than the $7 or $8 you'll spend to use that 65W incandescent over the same period. Replace that incandescent with the Lifx White 900, and your new bulb will pay for itself in energy savings in less than five years, then keep on shining for decades to come thanks to a 22.8-year life expectancy.

Now that brightness and efficiency are covered, let's get to the smarts. They're fairly substantial, as Lifx has done a good job of cultivating third-party integration with the likes of IFTTT, Nest, Logitech, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa. Even if you ignore them all, the Lifx app offers easy-to-use bulb controls for brightness and color temperature, along with the ability to set timed, automated lighting changes.

Those scheduled lighting changes are especially nice, with full controls for factors like color temperature and fade duration. Setting the lights in your bedroom to gradually fade to full, yellowy brightness over the course of an hour each morning is about as easy as setting a timer on your phone.

As for reliability, the bulbs depend upon the strength of your home's Wi-Fi network. In our tests, both in the CNET Smart Home and in my home, where I use a couple of Lifx products, the bulbs, the app and the integrations with platforms like IFTTT and Alexa have all proven reliable, with occasional hiccups typically solved by closing and reopening the app.

The one notable smart-bulb shortcoming with Lifx is a lack of support for HomeKit, Apple's iOS-based platform for connected home gadgets. It's obviously a nonissue if you're an Android user (or if you like Alexa better than Siri), but it's still something worth knowing before you buy, given that HomeKit is starting to become a pretty important player in the smart-home race. If HomeKit compatibility matters to you, then you're better off going with Philips Hue.

Among cloud-connected floodlights, the Lifx White 900 offers the right mix of features, performance and value. It's a bright, efficient smart light that lets you dial in whatever color temperature you like, and it works well with Alexa, IFTTT and other systems. At $30 per bulb, it certainly isn't cheap (especially if you're hoping to replace a whole home's worth of bulbs), but it's easier to afford than competitors like the Philips Hue BR30 LED. Dollar for dollar, it's the best Alexa-compatible floodlight money can buy."
Lifx Color 1000 BR30 Wi-Fi LED Smart Bulb review:|"

If money were no object, I'd have Lifx Color 1000 BR30 LEDs all throughout my home. They're bright, they're efficient, and they offer better-looking colors than Philips Hue, plus comparable smarts thanks to integrations with the Nest Learning Thermostat, with IFTTT, and with Amazon's Alexa.

But money  	is an object, and these LEDs aren't cheap -- 50 bucks each, to be exact, or about £40/AU$65. It's a lot of money for a light bulb no matter what currency you're using, and that stops me from recommending them outright (or, you know, filling my house with them). Plus, they don't work with Apple HomeKit, which might be a deal breaker for the iOS faithful.

Still, these are very good smart bulbs, and a justifiable splurge for owners of the Amazon Echo smart speaker thanks to those Alexa controls. You don't need these color-changing smart bulbs, but it's perfectly fine to want them, and fine to buy them, too, if  you're looking for a little more color in your day to day.

As LED floodlights go, the Lifx Color 1000 is flat-out great. With nearly 1,000 lumens at its brightest setting it's a legitimate upgrade in light output over the kinds of common 65W incandescents you might use it to replace. Bulbs like those typically put out less than 700 lumens.

It's efficient, too, drawing just 11 watts (oddly even less than  the white-light version of this bulb, which doesn't do colors and isn't quite as bright). With an 11W power draw, it'll save you about six or seven dollars per year in energy costs over that 65W bulb, all while putting out significantly more light.

Lifx bulbs are also terrific when it comes to color accuracy, and capable of producing rich, vivid tones at just about every shade. They're certainly  better color-changers than Philips Hue, which struggles to put out true tones of green and cyan due to weak blue diodes.

The smarts are on point, as well. The integration with Amazon's Alexa is particularly strong (I know because I own a couple of Lifx bulbs along with an Amazon Echo smart speaker, and use Alexa to control my lights each and every day).  Sync your Lifx account with the virtual assistant in Amazon's Alexa app, and you'll be able to ask her to turn things on and off or turn them up and dim them down.

Tack ""tell Lifx"" onto your command, and she'll be able to change the colors, too, a la ""Alexa, tell Lifx to change the table lamp to purple."" It works like a charm for me, and makes it fun and easy for anyone to play with the novelty of your color-changing bulbs.

Lifx bulbs also work with the free online automation service IFTTT (if this, then that). It's one of the best lighting-related channels on the service, with lots of options for how your automated lighting changes can run, along with  a veritable plethora of IFTTT-friendly smart-home gadgets and services to sync up with.

Of course, there's also the Lifx app, available on Android, iOS, and Windows devices. Pull it out and sync up with your bulbs over Wi-Fi, and you'll be able to turn things on and off with just a tap, or adjust their color, brightness, or color temperature with a smooth, easy-to-use color wheel (two of them, actually -- one for colors, and one for white shades). You can also schedule the lights to turn on and off at specific times, complete with extra controls for things like fade duration.

These lights aren't perfect, though. The app's preset themes are pretty underwhelming, especially the color cycle option. It offers lots of specific controls for how the colors should cycle, but it doesn't let you pick specific colors to cycle through, and it often seems to get stuck after just one or two color changes.

A lack of support for Apple HomeKit is a notable omission, too. With HomeKit, you'd be able to automate the bulbs alongside other iOS-friendly smart-home gadgets in Apple's Home app, and you'd be able to control them with Siri commands, too. None of that is supported at this time, though, and that isn't likely to change unless Lifx releases an all-new generation of HomeKit-friendly bulbs. If HomeKit is important to you, then you're probably better off going with Philips Hue.

These are undeniably good smart bulbs, but they aren't a must-buy. For starters, they're off-puttingly expensive at $50 each (though, in fairness, that's the same price you'll pay for a Philips Hue floodlight). They also missed the boat on Apple HomeKit, which is becoming an increasingly relevant platform for the connected home. The white-light only Lifx White 900, which costs $20 less, seems like the smarter buy to me.

Still, it's hard to argue against the quality of these bulbs. They offer bright, efficient performance, color accuracy that's dead-on, useful integrations with IFTTT and Alexa, and an app that's easy to use. They're also just a lot of fun, especially for kids. You could splurge on worse."
Philips Hue White LED Starter Kit review:|"

There's an awful lot to like about Philips Hue's smart lighting ecosystem. It's polished. It's easy to use. It works with just about everything. The only problem? The price. A starter kit with the essential Philips Hue Bridge and three color-changing bulbs  	costs $180 -- a steep point of entry for connected lighting.

Fortunately, that color-changing kit isn't your only option. For $70, Philips also sells a starter kit with that same Hue Bridge and a pair of plain, soft white smart bulbs. They won't change colors at all, but you can still automate them to turn on and off or dim up and down, and they'll work with all of the same third-party services as the rest of the Hue lineup, including Amazon's Alexa, Apple HomeKit, IFTTT, the Nest Learning Thermostat and more. Plus, given that the Hue Bridge typically sells for about $60 on its own, you're basically getting them for $5 each if you buy the kit, which is a heck of a deal.

All of that makes the Philips Hue White LED Starter Kit a near must-have for anyone who's serious about connected lighting and a very safe purchase given how good Philips has been about keeping its bulbs up to date with the latest platforms and products.

The Philips Hue White LEDs are good light bulbs in their own right. Each one puts out over 800 lumens at full brightness, making them a fair replacement for a standard 60W incandescent. They're efficient, too, putting that light out from a power draw of just 9.5 watts. That's excellent, especially for a connected LED that's doing more than just emitting light.

If you take a look at the shape of the bulb itself, you'll see that it's nice and wide, extending out beyond the heat sink that makes up the bottom half. That gives it a nice, omnidirectional light output that can shine downward if you're using it in something like a bedside reading lamp. To me, that's a slight edge over the  Lifx White 800 LED. Though the Lifx is a brighter bulb overall, its flat-topped design that falls flush with the base of the bulb prevents the bulb from casting as much downward light as it should.

"" data-image-credit=""Tyler Lizenby/CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""philips-hue-wireless-dimming-kit-product-photos-1.jpg"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""Philips Hue Wireless Dimming Kit-product-photos"" data-image-filename=""philips-hue-wireless-dimming-kit-product-photos-2.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2015/08/24"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""780"" data-image-width=""1040"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark=""1"" data-lightbox=""enabled"" data-parallax="""">

The Philips bulb also dims exceptionally well, going all the way down to 0.9 percent brightness at its minimum setting (about 7 lumens). And because it's using in-bulb dimming smarts as opposed to relying on in-wall dimmer switches, you won't have to worry about flicker or buzz. Just be sure not to use it with one of those in-wall dimmer switches, as the two dimming mechanisms will clash and cause the bulb to strobe.

So, how do you dim a light bulb if not with a dimmer switch? You've got a couple of options. First, there's the Philips Hue app, which will let you dim lights or groups of lights on your Android or iOS device. For physical controls, you could also pick up the  Philips Hue wireless dimming remote, which nestles into a wall-mounted holder and can control up to 10 bulbs at a time.

Then, there are those third-party integrations that are so, so important to the Philips Hue pitch. You could, for instance, pair your bulbs with Alexa, the  voice-activated virtual assistant in the Amazon Echo smart speaker, then ask her to dim them down to whatever setting you like. Same goes for Siri, since the latest, square-shaped version of the Hue Bridge works with Apple HomeKit. You could also use the free online service IFTTT to trigger your lights to dim automatically at a specific time.

We've tested just about all of Philips Hue's integrations in the  CNET Smart Home, where you'll find the Philips Hue White LED in pretty much every lamp we own. After months and months of use, it's been one of the most reliable and easy to use systems that we've installed and tested.

It's a bit ironic, but I like Philips Hue best when it ditches the colors. At $70, its white-light-only smart bulb kit is a very solid value -- much, much more so than the $200 color-changing kit. And once you've got that Philips Hue Bridge hooked up to your router, you can add additional bulbs a la carte style, including a color-changer or two if that's what you want. Even if you buy two of those color-changing Hue bulbs to add to your setup, you'll still be spending less than you would on the color-changing starter kit.

The bottom line: Hue is worth buying into if you want a rock-solid smart lighting platform in your home, and the Philips Hue White LED Starter Kit is your most affordable entry point. It's an easy recommendation for just about anyone with an interest in smart lighting."
This smart candle lets you light its wick with an app|"

The LuDela Smart Candle is a real candle with a real flame -- none of that cheap-looking LED candle stuff -- but you can light it with an app. You read that right: You can now literally light a flame with an app.

The app connectivity isn't just a gimmick, though. It also features extra safety features to prevent house fires or injury to young children, as well as scheduling features. According to LuDela's CEO, voice integration is even planned for the near future.

All these features come at a price. For $100, you get the base device, including a colored wax shell and a beeswax-and-soy 30-hour candle. Each additional shell you get (for seasonal decor, for instance) costs $20, and each additional candle is $8 (or $6, if you subscribe to LuDela's service).

The mechanics behind LuDela are simple, but creative. Essentially, the device comes in three layers: The outermost layer is a purely aesthetic shell; the second layer is the silicon device itself; and the third layer is the candle, which sits in a spring-loaded cradle to keep the wick at the top even as the wax burns away. The result is a pillar candle that's only a few inches in diameter. Only when you look closely near the wick do you notice the differences between LuDela and a standard candle.

LuDela lights the flame by channeling heat between four electrical nodes that surround the wick. It extinguishes the flame with a small fan nestled right beside the wick. Other than these two mechanisms, the device consists of various sensors for safety purposes. If the candle tilts to the side, for example, it will automatically extinguish the flame. If anything passes over the top of the flame within a few feet, the flame will go out. Essentially, it seems like the LuDela's Smart Candle will attempt to diminish the dangers of regular candles.

I'm not thrilled about LuDela's price; $100 for app control and extra safety features seems a bit pricey -- especially when standard pillar candles or smart LED candles will only set you back between $10 and $40. That said, as someone who hates hunting around for a lighter or matches, I like the idea of lighting a candle with my phone.

LuDela is available for preorder beginning today, and the company plans to ship out units by the end of 2016.

Editor's note: The original article stated the device is made using silicone, when in fact it is made of silicon. The text has been changed accordingly."
SkyBell downsizes the smart doorbell with Trim Plus|"

Startup SkyBell, makers of the $199 SkyBell HD Wi-Fi Video Doorbell, unveiled a new product at the CEDIA consumer product conference in Dallas this week -- the SkyBell Trim Plus.

Similar to the brand's HD doorbell, the Trim Plus boasts 1080p high-definition video resolution, night vision and access to the related Android and iPhone app. But the Trim Plus comes with two bonus features: a smaller design and optional battery power.

This is important for a couple of reasons.

First, the current roster of connected doorbells is huge. Of course, ""huge"" is relative when you're talking about a device that traditionally goes on a doorframe, but the SkyBell HD Wi-Fi Video Doorbell, August Doorbell Cam and Ring Video Doorbell are all significantly larger than your standard push-button buzzer that's less than an inch wide.

That's partly because these devices can do a lot more than the not-so-smart doorbell you probably have at home today. Additional features like live streaming, motion alerts and recorded video clips make them much more like security cameras than your traditional entryway buzzer. Some of these features, especially the camera portion, take up space. But SkyBell's Trim Plus apparently packs all of these features into a 1.39-inch-wide frame.

Second, the battery option offers flexibility for anyone who doesn't have a hardwired doorbell, but still wants to enjoy the features offered by a connected model. In the case of the battery-powered-optional Ring Video Doorbell, taking the battery-powered route means no access to a live stream (as it would drain the batteries fast). I've reached out to SkyBell for confirmation on whether this is also the case for the Trim Plus.

In addition to the Trim Plus, SkyBell will also offer Chime, a standalone speaker designed to play a doorbell melody. Chime is outfitted with LEDs that are supposed to change colors as someone approaches, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ""for communicating with other smart home devices,"" according to the official press release.

SkyBell's Trim Plus and Chime are expected to hit retail toward the end of the year. Details on pricing and third-party integrations are forthcoming. Check back soon for updates."
Sleep no more: Sevenhugs pauses development of sleep tracker|"

Editors' note, February 10, 2017: A Sevenhugs' representative amended the company's earlier statement -- noting that production itself hasn't been paused, but feature development has halted while they work to fix a bug. The piece has been updated accordingly.

I thought a sleep tracker that worked with Alexa, Nest, Philips Hue and IFTTT sounded too good to be true. As it turns out, it might be too good to be true, at least for now.

Due to a Wi-Fi connectivity error, French tech startup Sevenhugs is halting work on updates, features and software development while the company tries to fix the bug on the HugOne system.

The HugOne is a colorful, family-friendly set of gizmos. Place one of the system's sleep sensors on the corner of your bed (one for each person sleeping in it), and it'll track your movements throughout the night. In the morning, after you've woken up, the sensor will transmit the data back to the base station using Sevenhugs' proprietary frequency, letting you track everything on your Android or iOS device.

The sensors also track the temperature and humidity conditions in each room. If anything's amiss, the base station will change from a blue glow to a pink one to let you know to take action and open a window.

I'd just started testing the HugOne but couldn't get the system's hub connected to my Wi-Fi. I worked with the company on troubleshooting and even downloaded the beta of a future app update. to no avail. As it turns out, I'm not the only one having trouble.

Per a company representative via email, the issue only affects a ""small percentage of customers."" The representative noted that for customers ""unable to resolve their issue with customer support, we provide two options: a) full refund plus free return shipping or b) free product replacement. We greatly appreciate our customers, and we are doing everything in our power to take care of them.""

A properly functioning HugOne should work with a few notable smart home gadgets. Sync it up with a Nest Learning Thermostat, and you'll be able to trigger your thermostat whenever everyone's in bed and again when everyone wakes up. You'll also be able to connect it with Philips Hue's smart LED lighting system and trigger your bulbs to turn off when you get in bed, or to fade on in the morning. Take advantage of the system's channel on the free automation service IFTTT, and you'll be able to trigger even more smart-home gadgets.

The system will also be compatible with Amazon's Alexa, which lets you ask the voice-activated virtual assistant to tell you the air quality in each bedroom.

This isn't the first we've seen of Sevenhugs. Back in January 2016 at CES, the startup offered CNET a look at a prototype of a touchscreen remote for the smart home, with contextual controls that change depending on what you're pointing it at. The Sevenhugs team has had it on hand again at several shows since then, including this year's CES, but it's still only available for preorder.

The HugOne sleep tracking system is available through Amazon Launchpad. Though the company clarified that production as a whole hasn't stopped, I'd still recommend waiting on a purchase until we've confirmed the connectivity issue is fixed."
Nest Cam Outdoor review:|"

If you like Nest Cam Indoor, you're probably going to like the $200/£150 Nest Cam Outdoor, too. That's because Nest essentially took its wide-angle high-definition indoor-only camera, wrapped it in a weather-friendly finish and offered it up to folks looking for a DIY outdoor camera.

That may seem a touch lazy to some, but Nest's indoor camera is great, so the team simply applied its core specs to another product. That's not all the Google/Alphabet property did, though.

Nest also updated its app to give every user 3 free hours of event-based cloud storage -- a significant upgrade that makes it more competitive with other DIY cams on the market. Now available for sale in the US with plans to expand internationally later this year, Nest Cam Outdoor is an outside-rate security camera I can comfortably recommend.

There are quite a few outdoor-rated DIY security products on the market. Here's a non-exhaustive list of of the field today:

The vast majority of the products listed above are specialty outdoor products. The SkyBell HD Wi-Fi Video Doorbell, August Doorbell Cam, Ring Video Doorbell, Ring Video Doorbell Pro and Bird Home Automation DoorBird Video Doorbell, for instance, are all doorbell cameras. That means you'll have to replace your existing buzzer to set up one of these camera-equipped Wi-Fi versions. Similarly, you'll have to replace an existing wired outdoor light to install the Kuna Light Fixture.

Panasonic's Outdoor Home Surveillance Camera Kit worked fine, but was quite dated and we haven't yet reviewed the Panasonic Nubo, Ring Stick Up Cam or Kuna Toucan. But the Netgear Arlo is a solid competitor to Nest's Outdoor Cam. Take a look at the two cameras side by side:

While these cameras do share a lot of similarities, they have one major distinction -- their power source -- and it's really up to you whether you want to deal with a power cord or batteries. The Outdoor Cam's 25-foot power cord is long enough to give you quite a bit of leeway if your outdoor outlets aren't near your ideal installation spot. Still, you have to find a way to minimize the look of a long white cable hanging outside your house.

A battery-powered model like Netgear's Arlo makes installation easier, but you'll have to grab the camera from its installation spot periodically to swap out those hard-to-find CR123's.

I also have a question about theft with both of these units. Both Nest Cam Outdoor and Arlo look nice, but they have white finishes that aren't especially discreet. They also attach to their bases via magnets, making them simple to steal. For Nest Cam Outdoor, I'd suggest using the included clips to secure the power cord as a minimum precaution. Presumably you'll also get video footage of any thieves.

When Nest announced the US retail availability of its Nest Cam Outdoor on September 8, it also launched a pretty major software update for both Android and iPhone. You can check out this post for the full details, but here's the gist:

Netgear ArloKuna Light FixtureKuna Toucan SkyBell HD Wi-Fi Video DoorbellAugust Doorbell CamRing Video DoorbellRing Video Doorbell Pro Ring Stick Up Cam Bird Home Automation DoorBird Video DoorbellPanasonic Outdoor Home Surveillance Camera KitPanasonic Nubo (Europe only)

Nest introduced 3 hours of free activity-based snapshots via a new feature called Sightline. Previously, you had to subscribe to Nest Aware for at least $10 per month to view past activity, but this 3-hour feature option at least gives users some glimpse into past events.

You can do even more with Sightline if you Subscribe to Nest Aware:

Nest also added Person Alerts for Nest Aware subscribers. Person Alerts isn't the same as facial recognition in that it can't tell who it sees, just that it sees someone. Still, it's a pretty significant addition.

Since everyone gets a one-month free subscription to Nest Aware from the date they set up their camera, I was able to test out all of these feature. Everything worked consistently well, with one frustrating exception. You still don't get an alert every time activity is detected. Nest says this is supposed to keep you from getting inundated with too many alerts. Fair enough.

Instead, it tries to determine what activity is the most important for you and uses Sightline's algorithm to show you the highlights. That could be a huge problem if you don't get an alert during a burglary, but a lot of people want complete control over their alerts so they can decide what's important and what isn't.

In terms of third-party integrations, I programmed Nest Cam Outdoor to send me a text when it detected either sound or motion via IFTTT. Nest Cam Outdoor doesn't show up as a dedicated IFTTT channel, but my camera still appeared in the list of available products via the general Nest Cam channel.

Nest's Outdoor Cam is a top contender as far as outside-rated DIY security products go. Its HD live stream is solid, its new 3-hour cloud storage adds significant appeal for folks who aren't interested in paying for Nest Aware and its magnetic base makes it easy to install.

On the other hand, that magnetic design also makes it easy to steal, and the power adapter could be a major eyesore depending on where you install it. I would also like to see more options in terms of alert customization rather than having to rely on Nest's algorithm to handle everything for you. Still, the $200/£150 Nest Cam Outdoor is a very strong outdoor security device that I highly recommend.

Not sold? Take a peek at the battery-powered Netgear Arlo.

Yale's new doorbell lets you see who's at the door|"

Video doorbells have gotten a lot of attention over the past year. Now Yale, best known for its locks and deadbolt, wants in on the action.

Its product is called Yale Look, and it's a $170 video doorbell that you'll mount directly onto your front door. When someone walks up, a built-in motion detector will see them and start broadcasting the video feed to a touchscreen on the inside of your door. When they ring the chime, you'll get a notification on your phone, along with the ability to view the feed or engage in two-way audio.

That's not too much different than what you'll get with similar smart home doorbells from names like Skybell, August, and Ring, but Look sets itself apart with the addition of that dedicated video monitor on the inside of the door. It seems handy for people who don't want their smart homes to tie them to their phone, but it looks a bit clunky, and also requires you to drill through the door to stay connected to the exterior camera. Good luck selling your spouse on that -- let alone your landlord.

The video monitor includes a rechargeable battery that promises to last anywhere from six months to a year depending on usage. When it runs low, you can pop it off of the mount and recharge it via USB. It also comes with an 8GB SD card to store motion-activated video clips.

Yale tells us that the Wi-Fi version of Look will arrive at retail in October, with a second $240 version due out by the end of the year that'll add in a Z-Wave radio to let it sync up with larger smart home control platforms like SmartThings or Control4. We'll keep an eye out for both."
People Power gives its Presence app a 360-degree view|"

People Power, the folks behind the Android and iPhone Presence app and the Presence Security Pack, are introducing a new piece of hardware today via Indiegogo: Presence 360.

Available to pre-order worldwide now starting at $99/£75/AU$130, Presence 360 is a plug-in phone stand designed to rotate 360 degrees. Like the Zmodo Pivot camera, Presence 360 is supposed to be able to capture activity happening throughout a space -- not just within a fixed field of view.

Here's a quick rundown of Presence 360's features and capabilities:

Combine that with the Presence app's motion alerts and video clip storage and this seems like a fairly solid alternative to a traditional camera. I have just one question -- if you're spending $99 on this thing, why not go ahead and invest in a traditional security camera?

The whole appeal behind camera apps like Presence, Manything (featured in the video above) and Salient Eye is that you can turn a spare phone into a makeshift security device for free. $99 is less than most of the security cameras I've tested, but People Power plans to bump up the price of Presence 360 to $140 after the Indiegogo campaign ends.

Given that the Zmodo Pivot costs just 10 bucks more at $150 (and is currently on sale on Amazon for $100), I'm not convinced that Presence 360 offers a good value. We'll just have to test it out to be sure. Presence 360's are expected to ship to backers in December 2016 whether or not its $20,000 funding goal is met on Indiegogo.

TP-Link introduces affordable, Alexa-ready smart bulbs -- no hub needed|"

By this point, there are plenty of smart lighting options that work with Alexa, Amazon's voice-powered virtual assistant, but a new trio of smart bulbs from TP-Link are some of the most affordable yet. Dubbed the LB100, the LB110, and the LB120, the new Wi-Fi bulbs start at $20 each, don't require a hub, and promise to work with Amazon's Alexa right out of the box.

The LB100 (the $20 option) offers 600 lumens of plain, white, dimmable light from a power draw of less than 10 watts. Upgrade to the LB110, which costs $25, and you'll bump the lumen count up to 800, putting it right on par with what you'd expect from a standard 60W incandescent.

The LB120 adds in ""color tunability,"" which lets you dial the bulb's color temperature between a low, yellowy glow and a hotter, more bluish-white daylight tone. It's the priciest of the three at $35, so the other two are the better buy if you aren't picky about color temperature. If you are, then I'd recommend checking out the Lifx White 800 -- it offers the same tone-shifting smarts and Alexa-compatibility as this TP-Link bulb, and it also supports third-party services that TP-Link doesn't, like IFTTT and the Nest Learning Thermostat. Plus, you can currently get it from retailers like Target for about $30 -- a few bucks less than TP-Link is charging.

All three of TP-Link's bulbs connect directly with your router over Wi-Fi, so you don't need an additional hub to use them. There's some nice appeal there, given that low-cost competitors like the GE Link LED, the Cree Connected LED, and the Philips Hue White LED all require you to plug a hub into your router to translate their Zigbee signal into something your home network can understand. No such hassle here with TP-Link -- just screw the bulb in, download the free 'Kasa' app to your Android or iOS device, and let the smart lighting begin.

Best known for making router hardware, TP-Link is no stranger to offering Alexa-compatible gadgets at a discount. It already offers a pair of Alexa-ready smart switches that work like the Belkin WeMo Switch does, but cost less. These bulbs are taking the same undercutter approach, and if they work as advertised, they stand to be a good option for folks looking to save some money on their smart home build-out.

At any rate, we'll be sure to screw a few in at the CNET Smart Home and let you know how we like them. In the meantime, you can find the bulbs for sale on TP-Link's website, on Amazon, or at Home Depot."
Emerson 1F78-151 review:|"

Of the five affordable programmable thermostats I've reviewed to date, Emerson's $43 1F78-151 -- sold on Amazon for $26 -- is the least interesting. Sure, it will dutifully adjust the temperature for you four times a day, but it really doesn't have much else going for it, and that makes it hard to recommend for purchase over most of its competitors.

To begin, the 1F78-151 doesn't come with a backlight like the Lux TX500U, the Hunter 44157, the White-Rodgers P200 and the Honeywell RTHL2310B. Of course, not having a ""nightlight"" feature isn't exactly a deal-breaker at this price range, but it would definitely make the small display easier to read -- especially in low-light situations.

This thermostat also feels cheaply made from its white plastic casing to its buttons and its display. I know, all of these thermostats cost at or under $30, so what should I expect? But some of these competitors really do stand out by comparison, especially the streamlined, backlit Lux TX500U.

To appear more minimal, many manufacturers attach a plastic covering to their thermostats. That way, you can flip open the covering when you need to access certain buttons and can otherwise keep them covered. Instead, Emerson's 1F78-151 displays everything up front in a way that looks cluttered.

Its default is also to flash the time and the current ambient temperature reading, something I find slightly annoying. I would much rather the thermostat display stay fixed and not alternate between different types of information. The Emerson 1F78-151 is decent, but I would consider the Lux TX500U or the Honeywell RTHL2310B instead.

Note: This thermostat is compatible with basic heating and cooling systems; click here for more details. If you have questions about installation, consult a professional."
Window cleaning robot vacuum is a little ridiculous, a little adorable|"

Spring cleaning just got easier...maybe. Attach the Windowmate to each side of your window, and it'll make its way in Zamboni-like rows until both sides of the pane are clean. It's essentially a robot mop with sponges attached to the base that works vertically.

The Windowmate is on display here at the IFA trade show in Berlin this week. And it chugged along diligently during a demonstration. Apparently, the Windowmate can clean for 90 minutes straight on a full charge, though it takes two and a half hours to charge.

It cleans both sides of the window simultaneously  because it attaches to the glass with magnets. One half of the body sits on either side of the pane, so they hold each other in place. The advantage of that is the robot won't fall off your window if it loses power. The Windowmate representative at IFA told me the magnets are strong enough to withstand wind as well. The disadvantage: You have to be able to reach both sides of the glass simultaneously to put the Windowmate in place.

If you have a window that doesn't open, you're probably out of luck unless you send someone outside with the other half of the robot. Plus, the Windowmate orients itself by the frame, so you have to detach it and put it back up for each different pane of glass you want to clean.

I can't think of a window in any home I've ever lived where using the Windowmate would make more sense than grabbing some paper towel and Windex. Store owners, though, might find it more useful, and that's the primary intended market for the bot. Still, it's a cool concept -- I'd certainly like a robot to take window cleaning off my plate.

The model on display at IFA is the second edition of the Windowmate. The first launched in Japan only, but this one's coming to Europe as well, where it'll retail for 500 euros, which converts roughly to $560, £420 or AU$740. A Windowmate representative told me of plans to bring the bot to the US as well, perhaps in 2017.

Maybe the product will be a little more refined and make more sense as a consumer device by the time it launches in the US. Regardless, I'm happy to know window cleaning robots are out there.

Swann's latest security kit comes with four HD cameras|"

Swann has sold DIY security kits globally for nearly 30 years and today marks the latest addition to the company's roster -- the $500 Smart Series system.

Packed with four 1080p HD cameras, an outdoor siren, two door/window sensors, a key fob and an 8-channel digital video recorder (DVR) with a 1TB storage drive, it certainly seems like a great value. For a quick comparison, popular standalone 1080p security cameras like Nest Cam cost $200 each. You could only get 2.5 Nest Cams with the same amount of money you'd spend on Swann's complete Smart Series system, so why am I not rushing out to buy one?

The sheer number of accessories makes Smart Series seem tempting, but I'm not sure about its quality.

""Swann is a forward thinking DIY security and smart home technology company that provides innovative yet cost effective solutions for consumers,"" a Swann spokesperson told me in an email.

Not so fast, Swann. The previous Swann systems we've gotten our hands on feel cheaply made. One Swann system I began testing, SwannOne, was so difficult to get online that I ultimately gave up on it. SwannOne also had limited overlap with the burgeoning smart-home market. That means it didn't play well with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, IFTTT, or any other mainstream connected platforms.

The new Smart Series system seems more connected to the broader automation industry than SwannOne, though. It claims compatibility with devices from brands like Kwikset, Yale, Philips, Nest and Samsung's SmartThings platform. Smart Series also offers a related Android and iPhone app for remote access to the system's basic functions.

Here's an overview of the Smart Series' accessories, features and specs:

Swann has some convincing to do to prove that its systems add anything innovative to the security and smart-home space, but I'll reserve final judgment until I get my hands on a Smart Series.

Have a radiator? This thermostat wants to make it smarter|"

The era of the smart thermostat is here with Nest, Ecobee and Honeywell leading the charge worldwide. But there's one type of connected home heating that's been largely overlooked: radiators.

Of course, some of the Wi-Fi thermostats on the market today can work with select radiator units. The majority, though, are optimized for forced-air systems that rely on ducts to carry warm and cool air from a centralized source around your house.

Tado, a startup based in Munich, Germany wants to change that trend with its new Smart Radiator Thermostat exclusively for the European market, announced today at the IFA 2016 consumer electronics conference in Berlin.

Available now on Tado.com, the team will offer a Smart Radiator Thermostat Starter Kit for £179/€199 with two thermostats and one Wi-Fi hub, as well as standalone Smart Radiator Thermostats for £59/€79 a pop.

In addition to smartening up your radiator setup via a related app, Tado says its thermostats are also compatible with Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa, as well as IFTTT.

With HomeKit and Alexa, you can literally command your thermostat to do your bidding. Phrases like ""Alexa, set the living room to 23 degrees [23 degrees Celsius converts to 73 degrees Fahrenheit],"" and ""Siri, switch on the A/C in the bedroom"" give you even more ways to access your thermostat remotely. And with IFTTT, you can create a variety of custom automation rules linking your Tado Smart Radiator Thermostat with connected products from other manufacturers.

Tado told me it has no immediate plan to sell this thermostat or its new £199/€249 next-generation Smart Thermostat V3 overseas, but its Smart AC Control, announced at last year's IFA show, is available in the United States.

Watch your door wherever you are with Bosch's Eyes|"

If you're looking for a better way to monitor the front porch of your home than peering through the peephole, then the €350 Bosch Eyes Outdoor, unveiled at IFA 2016 in Berlin, just might be the ticket. Designed to function as a light, motion sensor alarm, and intercom all in one handy contraption, the Eyes Outdoor will also have its camera peeled for any activity that happens outside your door.

If the Eyes Outside sounds familiar, it should since it mirrors practically all of the capabilities of the $199 Kuna Light Fixture. The same is true of the Netatmo Presence, announced this January.

As for when and where you'll be able to purchase an Eyes Outside camera, Bosch expects the product to arrive by the end of 2016, initially in Germany, Austria and the UK. Company reps did say a US launch of the product is in the works but declined to disclose specific timing or a price. (For reference, the announced cost in Euros converts to about $390, £300 or AU$520.)"
Don't look now: Bosch's security cam can recede into its shell like a turtle|"

Capable of seeing everything and nothing, the Bosch 360 indoor camera can turn and look in any direction. The lens also recedes into its shell with a tap, should you need some privacy.

Introduced today at the IFA trade show here in Berlin, the camera's part of a trio of new Bosch smart home products announced as the appliance manufacturer pushes further into connected convenience.

The indoor connected cam includes motion sensors, an intercom for two-way audio and infrared night vision so you can watch over your house at any hour. When it senses something, it records HD footage to local storage, and you can use your phone to watch clips, or live footage.

If you don't want it spying on you when you're home, you can tap the top or tell it to recede via the app, and the top of the cam will duck into the body. The demo of this tickled me -- the camera reminded me of a shy turtle when it pulled its head down.

The camera will roll out starting at the end of this year in Europe. A Bosch representative promised it'll come to the US at some point down the road after that. The recommended price is 250 euros, which converts to roughly $280, AU$370 or £210. That's a little pricey, as it's more than our current favorite smart home cams -- the Nest Cam and Piper -- so it'll need to be more than cute to keep up with the competition.

False alarms be gone -- Bosch's smart smoke detector hopes to reduce annoyances|"

Bosch is refining the sense of smell on its Twinguard smoke detector with the goal of reducing false alarms. The Twinguard not only includes photoelectric smoke detectors, but senses air quality to help determine when there's a real emergency.

When the alarm sounds, the Bosch Twinguard will send you a push notification on your phone, and it can trigger other smart devices in the Bosch Smart Home system. You could have your Philips lights blink when the smoke alarm sounds, for example.

Outside of emergency situations, the Twinguard monitors temperature, humidity and general air quality by detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so it stands to be the most knowledgeable smoke detector on the market. The Nest Protect similarly offers app-enabled smarts, and both the Nest and Bosch detector distinguish between different types of smoke to help make an informed decision about when to sound the alarm. The Nest Protect, however, doesn't monitor VOCs.

Bosch's Twinguard is one of three new smart home products Bosch introduced today at the IFA trade show here in Berlin. The company best known for its dishwashers is clearly making a concerted push into the fully connected home. When Bosch first announced the Bosch Home Connect app, the goal was to encompass everything. Now, with a wider variety of devices, we're starting to see that plan come to fruition.

My main concern for the smoke detector is implementation. The First Alert OneLink Smoke Detector showed what can go wrong when a company throws half-baked smarts onto a safety product. The Bosch Twinguard looks to be taking a simple approach, with the app serving as a monitor and a notifier. I'll be keen to test its responsiveness once it launches in the US.

The Twinguard will debut in parts of Europe at the beginning of 2017, though a representative promised me it would make its way to the US at some point in the future. Expect more details on when it'll come to the US at CES. The recommended price in Europe is €150, which converts to roughly $165, AU$225 or £13o.

Philips Hue's new motion sensor will light up the room|"

This is typically the time of year when Philips tells us what's new with Philips Hue. And, sure enough, here we are with a new Philips Hue motion sensor accessory. Sync it up with your smart-lighting setup when it arrives this October, and you'll be able to trigger your color-changing smart bulbs just by walking into the room.

The device doesn't look much different from other motion sensors on the market. It's a small, square gadget that you can hide under the bed, mount on the ceiling or stick to the fridge thanks to an included magnet attachment.

Also included: a built-in daylight sensor that promises to save energy by activating lights only when you actually need them. That's a smart little extra that you won't find in most other motion detectors.

The motion sensor is completely wireless, and runs on a pair of AAA batteries. You can pair up to 12 of them with the Philips Hue Bridge, then program which lights each one should control within the Philips Hue app. Once you've got everything set up, Philips promises that the lights will come on within a half-second of motion being detected.

All that said, you could argue that the motion sensor isn't the biggest thing Philips is announcing today. The company also claims that it'll soon start selling new and improved versions of its signature White and Color Ambiance LEDs -- specifically ones designed to shine a little brighter, and to do a better job with greens and blues. That's a welcome fix for one of Hue's biggest flaws, but people who spent $200 to buy in with the second-gen bulbs last October might be justifiably peeved that Philips didn't fix it a year ago.

You'll be able to spot those new bulbs in packaging that carries a new ""richer colors"" badge. A Philips spokesperson tells us, ""Existing Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance bulbs will continue to work as before; however, to get the benefits of the richer colors consumers will need to purchase the new bulb.""

In addition to the new motion sensor and the improved White and Color bulbs, Philips is announcing the arrival of some new skews for its Philips Hue White Ambiance LED. That bulb offers adjustable tones from the white-light spectrum -- now, you'll be able to get one with a GU10-shaped base, as well as a BR30-shaped floodlight variety.

The Philips Hue Motion Sensor will cost $40 when it arrives this October (international pricing isn't available yet, but that price comes out to about £30/AU$55, converted roughly). You'll find it on the Philips Hue website, as well as on Amazon and at Best Buy. We'll be sure to test it out in the CNET Smart Home and let you know how we like it."
Project Nursery Video Baby Monitor System review:|"

One of the perks of having an app-connected video baby monitor is that you don't need to carry the base station screen around the house with you. Instead, you just pull up the app on your phone and get an instant update on your napping kiddo.

Project Nursery wants to bring together the best of both worlds -- a secure, non-app-connected camera with a base station monitor that isn't a hassle to carry around. Its solution: a 1.5-inch monitor that straps to your wrist like a smart watch. This mini monitor is included with the typical camera, a 5-inch base station viewing screen and a slew of great features. This creative design positions the $300 Project Nursery Video Baby Monitor System as one of the best on the market -- and one of the most expensive.

The first thing customers will probably notice when looking at Project Nursery's product is the $300 price tag. This video baby monitor costs more than most wearable monitors, video monitors and even things like automated infant seats and computerized changing pads.

But Project Nursery's monitoring kit will be worth the price for many parents. First, it has solid-but-not-incredible 800x640 resolution, a reliable connection, clear two-way audio, and plenty of extra features like motion alerts and lullabies.

Project Nursery really stands out because of its mini monitor, which shares all the features of the full-size base station. The 1.5-inch screen with a well-designed user interface is perfect for a wearable-type device. I used that monitor more often than the full-size one, especially when I did chores that required moving around the house.

This new monitor system isn't perfect, though. The $300 price will be prohibitive for many customers, no matter how many cool features are available. While the dedicated 2.4 GHz radio frequency keeps a consistent resolution, it has an 800-foot radius, which means you can't do any remote viewing -- a feature that would seem natural on a wearable wrist monitor like Project Nursery's. Even within that radius, there is minor latency when panning and tilting the camera. Finally, the wearable wrist monitor is pretty bulky -- especially for anyone who's accustomed to sleeker smart watches.

For all its minor shortcomings, Project Nursery's new monitor is a standout on the market. If parents can get past the price tag, it'll be a solid investment."
Summer Infant In View Digital Color Video Baby Monitor review:|"

With so many video baby monitors and smart cams that cost between $200 and $300, finding a product with both a camera and base station monitor for $130 seems like a steal. And that's exactly how much the Summer Infant In View Digital Color Video Baby Monitor will set you back.

Of course, for a lower price, you'll also get fewer features. That means no app connection, no pan/tilt control, and most notably, no night vision. The device still works, but the missing features definitely limit the use cases.

For instance, you can really only use Summer Infant to monitor your child from another room, because there's no remote viewing via an app. Again, most people use monitors when they're just a room away, but I like having app connection, so you can check in with your child when you've left them with a sitter.

The Summer Infant also won't monitor a whole nursery very well, because you can't move the view to follow your child around a room. Finally, the room must always be at least somewhat well-lit. Otherwise, you can't see anything.

All these limits mean Summer Infant is best suited for monitoring your napping kiddo from a room or two away -- and only if that room has some light. In that capacity, it works well. I especially like one design feature: a small LED strip along the top of the base station monitor. The strip lights up as the camera senses sound, so you don't necessarily need to keep the monitor volume up -- you can just keep an eye on the lights.

Besides the lacking features, Summer Infant works pretty reliably. Its streaming resolution is too low to see if your child's eyes are open or closed from a short distance, but you can see major movements and hear sounds. Similarly, the connection between the monitor and camera sometimes cuts out, but in my time with the device, such cuts were rare and brief.

Overall, Summer Infant's Monitor is basic, but reliable. You'll need to make sure the crib has some light around it at night, so you can still see the baby, but getting a camera and base station monitor for $130 isn't a bad deal."
Panasonic Wireless Home Baby Monitor Kit KX-HN6001W review:|"

What makes a smart baby monitor ""smart?"" Some devices are wearable, measuring heart rates and oxygen levels. Some are app connected. The Wireless Home Baby Monitoring Kit from Panasonic, shows off its smarts by integrating with a larger system -- the Panasonic Home Network.

At $180, Panasonic's video baby monitor is more affordable than much of the competition. Part of the way it cuts that cost is by excluding a standalone base station monitor. Instead, users can pull up the app on their phones to live stream their sleeping child. Like competitor iBaby, Panasonic maintains an impressive app and reliable connection.

The problem is, when you just use the monitor around the house, your phone gets tied up with the app, which can be frustrating if you're hoping to multitask with it.

Panasonic's Kit also includes a hub that can connect with devices like door/window sensors, motion sensors, and more -- all for a more integrated and secure nursery environment. Without those additional purchases, the hub really only functions as an audio alarm when the camera senses motion. But for customers interested in setting up a DIY monitoring system for their child, the hub adds a lot of potential.

Panasonic's device has a few major drawbacks. Most notably, the camera is one of the few in its price range without pan/tilt controls. In other words, once the camera is pointed in a direction, that's where it stays until you physically move it. The second issue is the lack of sensitivity personalization when it comes to motion and sound alerts. Under the default settings, I was able to walk across the whole field of view for the camera. As long as I went slowly, the alarm never went off.

The final problem with Panasonic was actually my first impression. Setting up the hub and the camera, connecting them on my Wi-Fi, and installing the multiple firmware updates required -- the whole process took over an hour (yes, you read that right). I'm glad to see Panasonic updating the firmware on these devices, as it shows at least some level of ongoing support. But setup for a baby monitor shouldn't take more than a few minutes, let alone 60.

Panasonic's baby monitor isn't the best device for its price. But for parents with an interest in DIY setups and large monitoring systems, it could be a good foundation for future investments."
Motorola MBP36S Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor review:|"

When I first unpacked the Motorola Baby Monitor and powered it on, I was surprised to see the base station screen on which you watch your baby immediately sync with the camera's view. Talk about a quick setup. The next week of testing it out, however, slowly chipped away at that first impression, and left me with an overall negative opinion of the product.

For $180, the Motorola Baby Monitor should feel like a solid mid-range video monitor. Sadly, half of the features listed for the device barely function thanks to a terrible app and a consistently low-performing connection.

Motorola's greatest strength is its out-of-the-box usability. Like the comparable VTech Monitor, it's perfect if you want to use the monitor mostly in-home. Leave the camera pointing at your child, run to the next room to do a little work, and you've got a screen right there with two-way audio and night vision. You can even pan and tilt the camera using the base station, albeit with noticeable latency.

You start running into problems when you download the third-party app that allows for monitoring via your mobile phone. In theory, this should add all sorts of features, like push notifications, motion and audio sensing, and video recording for later viewing. And Motorola would be one of the only companies offering both a base station and app. The problem is, the app's connection is so intermittent, I could barely even try out those features, let alone use them with any sort of consistency.

Despite the features the company boasts on its box, the Motorola Baby Monitor boils down to a very basic product. Despite the problems with the app, I could've recommend the monitor if the connection between the camera and base station were perfect. But even that connection suffers often, which leaves the product with almost no viable audience."
VTech Safe & Sound Owl Digital Video Baby Monitor review:|"

For anyone browsing baby monitors, it quickly becomes evident that VTech is a mainstay of the market. The company has developed many of the smartest audio-only monitors, and more recently, it has introduced video monitors to the mix. The VTech Safe & Sound Owl Digital Video Baby Monitor, VTech's most feature-rich offering, sells for about $200 online and at retailers.

The Safe & Sound Monitor might fall in the middle of the market when it comes to price, but its feature list is one of the shortest around. While the basics of two-way audio, pan/tilt control, and night vision are there, there's no app connection. Without app connection, there's no push notifications or remote viewing on your phone. The device doesn't offer any lullabies or stories. In fact, there's no real special features that stand out at all.

The simplicity of the Safe & Sound Monitor is also a strength, though. While the bells and whistles of other monitors might not be part of this device, neither are the connection problems or latency issues. The streaming, although at a strange PlayStation Portable-level resolution of 480x272, is consistent. The pan/tilt control of the camera is responsive. All around, it's a solid device.

One other strange design choice is worth noting: The camera that looks like an owl is a fun design feature for kids, but when the lights turn off and night vision is activated, the owl's eyes turn red. My infant son was too young to really notice, but for older toddlers, having an creature with glowing red eyes watching them at night might not go over so well.

The VTech Safe & Sound is worth checking out if you know you'll primarily use the monitor for in-home monitoring, and only on the most basic level. In that context, it's reliable. But if you're looking for fun features for the kid, or remote monitoring, look elsewhere."
Samsung SEW-3043W BrightView HD Baby Video Monitoring System review:|"

Buying a video baby monitor can be tricky. These gadgets range from $100 to $250, and their features are all over the place. Some have recorded stories to read to your child as they go to sleep; others don't even have night vision. Either way, finding the right product is always a balancing game between the price and the device.

The Samsung SEW-3043W BrightView HD Baby Video Monitoring System is certainly more expensive than many competitors' products, clocking in at $230. But it also offers one of the best suites of features. While a few major design limitations hold Samsung's device back from greatness, it is still one of the better high-end video baby monitors out there.

Samsung has all the requisite features for a higher end video baby monitor: pan/tilt control, consistent 720p resolution, night vision, two-way audio, and sound alerts. Navigating the settings on the base station monitor to take advantage of those features is also quick and easy, as opposed to Motorola's monitor.

A few feature omissions stand out to me, though. Most notably, there's no additional app for remote viewing or video recording and playback. While that means the device is likely more secure, it also means you can only use it around the house.

The second problem with Samsung's monitor is the base station screen itself. Unlike most competitors, Samsung boasts a touchscreen interface. But the touchscreen is so outdated that anyone with a smartphone will quickly feel frustrated using it. You have to press hard on the screen for it to register, and there is no swiping or scrolling. Instead, the buttons are located on the screen, rather than beside it. In the end, the touchscreen detracts from the quality of the user interface rather than enhancing it.

Despite those problems, Samsung's device works well. I only experienced a few connection hiccups during the days I tested it, and none of them lasted more than ten or fifteen seconds. While $230 does feel pretty pricey for a video baby monitor, it's a fair price for reliability."
iBaby Monitor M6S review:|"

When it comes to smart home tech, you can usually go one of two directions: the big-name company route, or the startup route. For baby monitors, either way you go, you'll get the same basic product: a smart camera with two-way audio, night vision, and a couple distinguishing features thrown in. The real differences lie in performance.

iBaby is probably the most notable startup in the video baby monitor market. Its premiere product, the $230 iBaby Monitor M6S, is just a camera -- foregoing the standalone monitor for a well-designed app. At a consistent 1080p, the M6S's video and connection quality is some of the best on the market. Plus, the device includes small but thoughtful additions to its feature list, like recorded stories and lullabies.

The iBaby Monitor M6S stands out in a few technical areas. It streams reliably even when you're away from home, and also remains responsive to pan/tilt control. You can look around the room with an easy touchscreen interface (as opposed to competitor Samsung's clunky touchscreen) on the mobile app, and the two-way audio is high quality.

Of course, iBaby isn't perfect. While receiving push notifications based on sound and motion detection is a cool idea, it stops being cool when, even at the lowest sensitivity settings, every shadow or switch of the A/C has you checking your phone. I ended up disabling push notifications while I was at work, simply because I was receiving one almost every 5 minutes.

The second problem with iBaby is its reliance on an app. Sure, the app works a lot better than much of the competition, but without a standalone base station monitor, parents using iBaby to monitor a child who's just a few rooms away will either constantly be checking their phone, or draining their batteries by leaving it on.

In other words, it might seem low-tech to have a standalone monitor, but it's really handy -- especially if you use your phone for work, and can't simply relegate it to background baby monitoring.

The iBaby Monitor M6S is one of the best cameras on the market, but its lack of a standalone monitor leaves a hole that a mobile app can't fill. Between that and the more expensive price, iBaby ends up being just good, when it could've been great."
Automatic's back with a new fitness tracker for your car|"



Automatic's plug-in driving gizmo is like wearable tech for your car. Plug it into the diagnostic port beneath your car's steering wheel, and you'll be able to track mileage and maintenance needs on your phone over Bluetooth, or even trigger your smart-home devices to turn off and on as you come go.

Now, Automatic is back with the new and improved Automatic Pro. The pitch is the same as before, but the price has gone up 30 dollars, to $130. For the extra money, the device now includes a fee-free cellular connection that allows it to log your miles even when you don't have your phone on you.

Automatic also pitches the cellular connection as a means of beefing up the gadget's smart-home chops. The device already boasts integrations  with Amazon's Alexa, the Nest Learning Thermostat and the free online automation service IFTTT. In those last two cases, Automatic can act as a trigger -- telling your Nest thermostat to shut the air off when you leave for work in the morning, or telling your smart lights to turn on when you arrive home at the end of the day. With an unlimited 3G connection, Automatic should be able to make those inter-device connections a little more reliably.

You'll also notice a newly refreshed Automatic app, available for both Android and iOS devices. It's largely a cosmetic overhaul, though Automatic is promising deeper controls for things like notifications and diagnostics, along with an improved Crash Alert feature that can automatically send alerts if the airbags ever deploy. You can also expect to see suggested IFTTT recipes built directly into the app, part of  IFTTT's recent push for native third-party controls.

Automatic Pro is on sale starting today, and available online at Automatic's website and on Amazon, or in store at Best Buy. We'll be sure to test it out at the CNET Smart Home just as soon as we get our hands on one."
Snuza Hero SE review:|"

There is no publicly available statistical evidence that wearable baby monitors protect young infants from health concerns like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). And yet many companies are selling them for as much as $250 -- what seems to many an absurd price for a device without proven effects.

And yet, between anecdotal evidence online and simple logical reasoning, many parents have made the decision to shell out for wearable monitors. It makes sense: a monitor that alerts you if your child stops breathing should at least improve your response time during a potential crisis.

The Snuza Hero SE is another in the long line of wearables. Like those before it, Snuza is not an FDA-approved medical device, and for legal reasons it won't claim to prevent SIDS or infant asphyxiation. But it's a device that reliably tracks your infant's breathing, alerts you if it stops and attempts to rouse the child with vibrations in case of emergency. And for $120, those simple features make it one of my favorite gadgets in this market.

The Snuza Hero SE strips the wearable monitor concept to its core, and nearly perfects it. Here's how it works: you take Snuza out of the box, flip on the switch and clip it to your baby's diaper. That's it. It literally takes 20 seconds to set up, and it's ready to go.

Essentially, the rubber sensor of the device rests on your baby's belly, registering their breathing. If the sensor doesn't detect any movement for 15 seconds, it vibrates to rouse the baby (this is important, since SIDS often occurs when natural arousal processes fail). If Snuza has to rouse the baby in this way three times, it will start beeping. And if the child doesn't move for more than 20 seconds, it will set off a loud alarm.

While Snuza, like every other major wearable monitor in the US, doesn't have FDA approval, its European equivalent (Snuza Hero MD) is certified as a medical device according to European standards.

While Snuza isn't app-connected, I actually don't mind it. First off, it means a lower price than competitors. Secondly, the data gathering of other devices can distract from their core purpose: to monitor the child and alert parents if something goes wrong.

Of course, the lack of app connection means you can't get a push alert if you're out of earshot. Snuza might work independently in smaller living quarters, but for a larger house, you'll need to use it with a standard audio or video monitor -- which you'll require to hear your baby wake up anyway.

The best parts about Snuza are the vibration and audible alarm features. While these certainly won't guarantee infants' safety, the attempt to intervene in the case of an emergency -- arousing a child whose breathing might be impeded while asleep -- distinguishes Snuza from devices that simply monitor and send alerts, like Owlet or MonBaby. Plus, I never have the fear that a push notification failed to warn me of a potential crisis.

Snuza Hero is the wearable monitor, streamlined. While $120 still feels a little too pricey for a gadget that won't stand alone as an all-in-one monitor, Snuza is far more affordable than its competitors."
Purify the air your baby breathes with the iBaby Air|"

I love raising my baby in a city, if only because I'm able to maintain a life without too much trouble. But with cities often comes pollution, and air-quality problems have been linked to major long-term health concerns -- especially for young children. It's not just an outdoor problem, either. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found indoors, including carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia, and plenty of others.

But now iBaby, a company that's built a name as a popular developer of baby monitors, has a solution: a smart air-quality monitor and purifier called the iBaby Air. The device just reached full funding on Indiegogo, but I got my hands on one before it launches later this year. Here are four things you need to know about iBaby Air.

Sure, plenty of gadgets monitor your home for carbon monoxide or smoke. Some even track dust, pollen, and CO2 levels. But few devices offer the sort of all inclusive air-quality monitoring that iBaby says it does. Of course, how well it tracks VOCs still has to be tested. But it's at least trying something few consumer devices in the past have done.

Aside from tracking air quality in the moment, the iBaby Air maps your home's air quality over time, letting you see improvements as you make them. While another recent crowdfunding project called Wynd is doing something similar, iBaby Air sweetens the deal with a speaker for music and two-way audio, a full RGB color nightlight and other features in the app.

The white finish looks fine, and the additional optional wood finishes will fit nicely with different home aesthetics. Plus, unlike those conventional air purifiers that take up a whole corner of your house, the 6-inch-tall iBaby Air can just perch on a mantle, out of the way.

That's not expensive, but it's not cheap either. Standard air ionizers cost around $60 to $80. The iBaby Air adds a lot of smarts to the package, but whether that merits the extra 70 or 80 bucks will depend on what users are looking for."
Fisher-Price 4-in-1 Smart Connect Cradle n Swing review:|"

Sometimes the only way to soothe a baby is by holding her. But if you want to have a life (or just some sanity), an alternative means of soothing the kid is really important. I have personal experience living at the whims of a teething child, and I'm a strong believer in buying some sort of rocker, swing or seat that'll give parents a little relief when they need it. The question is, which one should you buy?

It's not an easy question, in part because every child is different. Some babies like to ride in cars, some like to be rocked in cradles. But Fisher-Price's 4-in-1 Smart Connect Cradle 'n Swing tries to solve that problem by doing it all. I love the flexibility, but between a high price of $200 (about £150 or AU$270) and a giant frame, the Cradle 'n Swing loses some of its appeal. It's still worth considering, but only if you've already got the budget and the floor space.

Setting up the Cradle 'n Swing isn't as easy as I'd hoped. It took me between 30 and 40 minutes, and by the time I'd screwed together all the metal bars and fastened the plush cushion to the bed, I needed a break.

While initial setup isn't that big a deal, once the Cradle 'n Swing is assembled, it's also hard to move. This is a beast of a device, with the largest footprint of any baby-related tech I've tested. While it isn't too much larger than comparable non-smart devices, I still feel like its frame could be a little more compact. Additionally, it doesn't collapse well for travel or storage, so expect a permanent fixture in your home.

If you can get past the size, Fisher-Price's machine introduces some cool features. First off, it doubles as a swing and a rocker. You can automate the swing via the Bluetooth-enabled Smart Connect app, and you can also set it on a timer or with different swinging speeds. The rocker, on the other hand, involves no smarts -- it's just a cradle you can detach from the swing to rock your child to sleep.

Add in the standard music and ambient noise from the speaker, a mobile with light-up birds, and basic app control, and you're left with a pretty solid product.

The problem is, despite a compelling combination of features, I still want more out of the Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swing. The Editors' Choice Fisher-Price Sleeper costs half as much, and feels about equivalent in its feature offerings. I want the Cradle 'n Swing to rock automatically. I want it to provide vibration settings. I just want more.

I know what you're thinking: ""Why are you complaining about having to rock your own son to sleep?"" I have no problem coaxing my child off to dreamland, but if I'm going to shell out $200 for a device that can soothe him so I can clean the kitchen, then I want it to self-rock.

The Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swing isn't a must-buy product, especially given its price and features, but it performs reliably and my son genuinely enjoyed swinging in it for up to 30 minutes at a time. Many parents who need the relief of a rocker or swing will definitely get it from the Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swing -- and for less money than some competitors, like the 4moms MamaRoo. But on its own merits, can the Cradle 'n Swing justify a $200 price tag? I'm doubtful."
iDevices Socket review:|"

Lighting is one of the easiest and most affordable entry points into smart-home gadgetry. Connected LEDs, switches and plugs typically slide in around or under 50 bucks. But now a new type of device is available -- a retrofit Socket that lends smarts to any bulb screwed into it. Sure, crowdsourcing hopefuls have proposed similar products in the past, but this is different. iDevices is an established company, and the Socket integrates with Apple HomeKit and Amazon Echo.

On its surface, the Socket functions as advertised: it smartens up almost any standard bulb, adding dimming, scheduling and voice-activated controls with both Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. It even includes an RGB color changing nightlight. But there's a fundamental question I've been unable to answer: When is the Socket consistently more useful than a smart switch or bulb? The $80 price tag only adds to my befuddlement, since you can easily find more feature-rich lighting devices for considerably less cash.

Until I find a unique use case that justifies the Socket's otherwise outrageous asking price, I can't recommend iDevices' newest product.

Taken as it is, the Socket actually works pretty well. The iDevices app has always been one of the better third party HomeKit apps out there, and it continues to support its devices with an intuitive interface and easy setup process. Getting the Socket up and running takes barely a minute, and operating its dimming, scheduling, and nightlight capabilities is slick the whole time.

The iDevices app also connects to the Socket using both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so the connection is reliable whether you're home or away.

The big problem with the iDevices Socket is that it doesn't fulfill any particular customer need. If you want a bulb that can dim and schedule, buy a smart LED -- you'll get more lighting features than the Socket. If you want to keep your current retro bulbs, but also want smart features, buy a smart switch or plug -- you'll avoid the strange look of old bulbs hanging from a white plastic device.

I asked the developers at iDevices what exactly distinguishes the Socket from other devices on the market, and they responded with two primary features: it's easy to install (meaning it doesn't require a hub), and it works with Apple HomeKit (meaning you can control it remotely and using Siri).

But look at the Socket versus the Philips Hue White bulbs on the chart above. They're almost identical. Sure, Philips Hue bulbs require a hub, but that added cost and hassle stops looking so bad when each light bulb afterward costs only $15 -- $65 less than a single Socket.

Across the chart above, you can see that, yes, the iDevices Socket has a unique feature set. But that doesn't make it a unique product. Plenty of devices do scheduling and let you keep your original bulbs. Plenty do dimming, work with HomeKit or do hubless setup. If you need this exact combination of features, and you almost certainly don't, then you should consider the iDevices Socket.

But for most consumers, finding a gadget that offers a marginally different feature-set isn't worth 80 bucks."
BloomSky's new weather station has even more ways to log your backyard climate|"

Weather-centric startup BloomSky plans to track even more of your hyperlocal climate data with its new kit, the $249 BloomSky Plus. The BloomSky Plus bundle consists of two new gadgets, the Sky2 and Storm, which combined should be capable of sensing local weather conditions. Solar-powered, the setup uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless radios to send the info it captures to home networks, cloud-based servers and ultimately a companion mobile app,

At the heart of the BloomSky Plus package is the Sky2, a weather station and camera system bristling with sensors that measure everything from temperature and humidity to barometric pressure. An orb about the size of a grapefruit, the Sky2's body has a series of moisture sensors to detect rain events as they happen.

Fans of the original BloomSky device, the Sky, which shipped to customers in spring 2015, will find this latest station extremely similar. In fact, BloomSky says the Sky and Sky2 products are almost physically identical, with the primary difference being the Sky2's integrated Bluetooth LTE radio. According to BloomSky the added component is meant to lean on smartphones and tablets to aid the initial configuration of the weather station and link to your home network with fewer hiccups. Hopefully this will also mean less climbing on ladders to tap the Sky2's buttons if you place the machine on a lofty perch.

In addition to promising smoother deployments, the Sky2 will perform the same tricks as its predecessor, the most notable made possible by its onboard HD camera (1,920x1,072 pixels). During daytime hours the gizmo snaps still pictures every 3 minutes, which it them stitches together into short motion clips for your viewing pleasure.

The more interesting part of the BloomSky Plus bundle is the Storm device. Tucked away inside the Storm is an anemometer designed to measure wind speed along with a weather vane for detecting wind direction from eight compass points.  The Storm has a tipping-cup rain collector as well that provides an unlimited range for assessing rainfall in 0.2mm increments.

The Storm, like the first Sky device, has a UV light sensor, and it's equipped with its own solar panel. Without solar power, BloomSky claims the Storm's 3.7-volt (500-mAh) rechargeable battery has one week of staying power with a full charge.

The BloomSky Plus is no ordinary weather station that's walled off from the growing universe of internet-connected objects and appliances either. BloomSky pledges that both the Sky2 and Storm will support IFTTT integration like the current Sky device. The company also claims the weather station is ready to mesh with other smart-home platforms such as Nest and SmartThings, though as of yet neither has listed BloomSky as an official partner.

BloomSky plans to launch the Sky2 and Storm along with the BloomSky Plus ($249) combo on Kickstarter July 19, and the earliest Storm units ($99) are supposed to ship to customers in late October. The same October goal applies to BloomSky Plus kits, while the Sky2 bundle ($199 including its solar panel) could arrive as soon as August. BloomSky says the products will ship globally, though prices haven't been provided. Converted, the Storm's price would be about £75 or AU$130, while the BloomSky Plus bundle would be about £190 or AU$330."
Fisher-Price Smart Connect 2-in-1 Projection Mobile review:|"

Buying toys for infants and toddlers is more complicated than it sounds. How much does it cost? How much clutter will it add? Will your child play with it in six months? Will they play with it at all? That's what makes legos and blocks so special -- they have a long entertainment lifespan. A conventional mobile, by contrast, often stops entertaining kids within a few months.

But Fisher-Price has a solution: a device that includes a mobile and a projector, plus a slew of extra features to sweeten the deal -- all for the surprisingly affordable $70. It certainly isn't a must-buy product, but for most parents, the Fisher-Price Smart Connect 2-in-1 Projection Mobile offers a solid long-term investment.

The Fisher-Price Projection Mobile has it all. First off, it's got the standard-issue lullabies and ambient sounds preprogrammed into it. It also has a dim light for checking on your child in a dark room without waking them. Plus, the mobile can spin automatically, and the projector can shoot images onto the inner dome of the mobile. The device also listens for your child's cries, and will send you push notifications if it sounds like the kiddo is waking up.

If that sounds like a lot of features for $70, that's because it is. And you can even control all those features and set them on timers via Bluetooth using the iOS and Android app.

During my time with it, I used most of the Smart Connect Mobile's features. My son Idris loved watching the mobile spin automatically. I appreciated getting push notifications when he woke up after a nap. Even the light helped me check on him while he slept. Overall, while it can't do everything -- and definitely can't replace a standalone monitor -- the Mobile takes advantage of an impressive suite of features.

The Smart Connect Mobile isn't perfect, though. It attaches to cribs, for instance, but you can't really use it anywhere else. My son would've loved it on his sleeper or over his car seat, but that would've required considerable effort, jerry-rigging the setup every time.

The projector also misses its full potential. I love that you can remove the mobile and just project images directly onto the ceiling for older children. But kids will get bored of the same three or four animals floating above them every night. The projector's images are surprisingly sharp, so I would love to see it project star systems or the alphabet for educational purposes. Sadly it uses only one reel, so your child will quickly get familiar with the bunny, fox, squirrel and assorted birds on it.

Despite these minor limitations, the Smart Connect Mobile is a solid gadget for infants and toddlers. If Fisher-Price adds more projection reels and a flexible attachment in the future, this 2-in-1 Mobile could really do it all."
Wynd says it will measure and clean the air you breathe|"

If you live in a city, the air you breathe probably isn't doing you any favors. Most American urban areas maintain an Air Quality Index (AQI) score of under 100, meaning low-to-moderate risk of airborne pollutants. But prolonged exposure even to this decently clean air is still linked to long-term health problems. If you live in an industrial center like Beijing or New Delhi, the risk is far worse.

A new Kickstarter project, which has been gaining support for a few weeks now, might have a solution. The device, called Wynd, is a small cylinder that looks a lot like Amazon Echo -- only it sucks in particulate matter and expels 8 liters of purified air per second, creating a personal clean-breathing bubble for the user. Although it will sell for $189 (about £146, AU$252) and ship worldwide when we hit the expected release date in November, Wynd is currently available for preorder on Kickstarter for $139 (about £108, AU$186).

Besides air purification, Wynd has some tricks up its sleeve. First off, a detachable sensor on the bottom of the device can moonlight as a standalone wearable, constantly assessing the air you breathe. You can purchase this wearable sensor by itself for $69 (about £53, AU$92), but the developers are clear that the real magic of Wynd isn't its sensing tech, but its cleaning tech.

Wynd was assembled by engineers with backgrounds in jet turbine design, and it shows. The form of the device is elegant, and its function impressive. Air is sucked into the sides of the cylinder, and blown out the top to create a sort of bubble of clean air. The fan is designed to keep the clean air from dissipating. Of course, we'll have to wait and find out how well it actually works -- but the idea is still cool.

Although the device is easily branded as an individualized air purifier, Wynd has the possibility of doing much more. The Bluetooth-connected app includes software that tells you about the air Wynd cleans, like its AQI and the size of its particulate matter. According to Wynd's developers, this data could be a valuable crowdsourcing tool for the future, allowing users to see which public spaces are cleaner and which more polluted. Plus, by tracking the size of the particles, Wynd should be able to code the data on a basic level, indicating more and less dangerous types of pollution (such as finer material resulting from combustion, versus larger matter like dust).

Every crowdfunding campaign involves risks. For a young startup, bringing a new product to market on a short timeframe can prove far more complicated than anticipated. But Wynd has at least achieved the support of a sizeable community, and prototypes of the device look impressive. Here's hoping Wynd can hit its goals, because this little gadget looks pretty promising."
Ozmo Active Smart Cup review:|"

The Ozmo Active Smart Cup is an intriguing concept that gets bogged down by its high price and lack of features, ultimately making it tough to recommend. Here's the gist.

To combat dehydration, Hong-Kong-based startup Ozmo developed a $60/£45/AU$80 16-ounce Bluetooth-enabled cup available worldwide (also called Ozmo). Of course, you can put any drink under 176°F (80°C) in this sturdy-lidded drink holder, but it's specifically designed to auto-log your water and coffee consumption via built-in sensors. Initial question: Do we really need this much help remembering to drink water?

The Ozmo app walks you through the simple initial configuration then asks for some basic information -- your age, your height and weight, and your activity level (from low to extreme). From there, it arrives at an optimal amount of water you should drink every day. Mine was 108 ounces or 13.5 cups. That seemed high, but it's probably because I grew up with the ol' 8 cups of water a day adage and never really questioned it.

The software also decides on a maximum daily caffeine intake for you, 21 ounces in my case -- just over 2.5 cups.

Ozmo's durable Active Smart Cups weigh 12.7 ounces and are made of ABS plastic with a ""Tritan BPA-free"" inner coating. They come in blue, purple, red and gray finishes, along with compatible lids and USB adapters. (The lid has to be on tight for the cup to correctly log what you drink.) There's a removable rubberized tab at the bottom of each Active Smart Cup that conceals the reset button (needed for the initial configuration) and the Micro-USB charging port.

The cup is also outfitted with LED lights; it's fully charged when all three are illuminated. Charging from 0 to full took me roughly an hour -- a definite inconvenience when you're thirsty. It's supposed to last for up to three weeks on a single charge, but the user manual says that, ""Battery life may deteriorate over time with frequent use.""

You can follow the app to track your progress, but the LED alerts can also clue you in. When the first, second or third LED blinks on its own it means you've reached 20, 50 or 90 percent of your daily goal. When all three LEDs blink, you've reached your daily goal. Ozmo has various vibration-based alerts as well -- it buzzes once when you connect the cup to its power adapter and it buzzes six times when you haven't had anything to drink in over an hour. I got that alert at least twice today. Must. Drink. More. Water.

So yes, apparently I do need help remembering to drink water and Ozmo was kind of useful in that regard, but the cup's actual water- and coffee-tracking abilities weren't always on point. Occasionally, the app didn't  log the water or coffee I was drinking at all, making me wonder why I was using it.

Other times, it nailed it -- even when I tried to confuse it with warm water and iced coffee. But that lack of consistency makes Ozmo questionable as a serious hydration tracker. And if you're really trying to limit your caffeine intake, you'd likely need something that can also track sodas, teas and other no-nos. Given its $60/£45/AU$80 price tag, it's hard to get past these flaws; I'd look elsewhere for a solution."
iLumi's outdoor Smartstrip lets you landscape with light|"

iLumi, the company that got its start on Shark Tank and funded its first smart LED on Kickstarter, is back with another product. This time it's a $89 smart light strip called the iLumi Smartstrip.

The Smartstrip is doing a couple new things: first off, iLumi's newest product has outdoor-rated materials, and individually controllable LED lights within the strip. That means you can use the strips to landscape, and you can create much more dynamic lighting patterns that with other products.

The Smartstrip will also be on a Bluetooth mesh system with other iLumi products. That means, even if you're out of Bluetooth range, if you have other iLumi lights that are within range, you can still communicate with the Smartstrip. Think of it as a more reliable version of the game telephone.

The Smartstrip has solid specs to back up its design. The LEDs will shine RGB colors and white light, with 1500 lumens at max brightness. That's not quite as bright as the Philips Hue light strip, but it's close.

The default length of the Smartstrip will be 2 meters (about 6 feet), but the strip is also modular, so you can add single meters to lengthen it. This in combination with the individually toggleable LED's, makes it clear that iLumi's No. 1 goal is personalization. How well it works still remains to be seen, but the Smartstrip looks like a promising device.

The iLumi Smartstrip is live on Kickstarter now for a preorder price of $59. Once the product ships in December, the price will bump up to $89 -- which is more in line with products from the competition.

Crowdfunded projects can be a little unpredictable, but since this isn't iLumi's first rodeo, chances are the December release date will stay put. For more info, check out the Kickstarter page."
Switchmate review:|"

Switchmate is a $40 AA-battery-powered magnetic light controller that clings to the screws holding up your existing switch plate. Snap it on and you're done with the installation. The sheer simplicity of setup is intriguing -- who wants to deal with a big mess o' wires when you can just enlist magnets to do the heavy lifting?

But because it isn't hard-wired, Switchmate relies on batteries. And because it relies on batteries, it uses low-power Bluetooth tech rather than Wi-Fi. That means you can only control your lights from the related Android or iPhone app when you're standing within a limited range of roughly 150 feet.

Switchmate also doesn't work with dimmers or have any third-party integrations (although an Amazon Alexa skill is in the works). If circuit breakers and electrical wiring aren't your cup of tea, the easy-breezy Switchmate would serve you well -- just keep in mind that it can't actually do a whole lot.

Switchmate measures 4.9 inches tall by 2.5 inches wide, with a 1-inch depth. It weighs 4 ounces and is powered by two included AA batteries that the team claims can last anywhere from 8 to 12 months (I wasn't able to test this out, but I imagine it would vary a lot based on usage). It looks fine, but it's quite bulky compared to a standard switch plate.

Switchmate started out as an Indiegogo campaign with a couple of different color finishes, but the final version, available on Amazon, comes in white or beige for either toggle or rocker switches (these are sold separately, as the adapter on the back is different). Configuration is as simple as inserting the batteries, picking out a light switch to control and snapping it on. Fortunately, the magnets are strong and I can't see someone dislodging it easily by accident.

Note: Switchmate is only compatible with 1-gang switches. It can attach to multi-gang plates, but Switchmates are too wide to fit side-by-side. I really wish the team offered 2-, 3- and 4-gang options, since standalone 1-gang switches aren't incredibly common (in my house, at least) and it looks a little odd as a standalone 1-gang controller on a multi-gang panel.

Once you've attached Switchmate, download the Switchmate app and follow the steps to use your light switch -- it should only take a minute or so to connect. There wasn't a plus/minus battery indicator on my review units, so I installed the batteries upside down the first time -- if you're having trouble connecting, you might need to rotate your batteries, too.

The app itself is extremely bare bones, but simple to use. You can have up to 12 Switchmates installed on one account -- and the home screen displays all of the controllers you've installed. I tested two units, one toggle model and one rocker model, labeled Hallway and Living Room.

Touch the icon to manually turn a light on or off when you're within Bluetooth range or simply press the switch itself for the same on/off control. The back of each Switchplate has an adapter piece that fits to either a toggle or a rocker. When you turn a light on or off, the batteries power a motor that moves the adapter up or down. This worked reliably, but was loud -- almost loud enough for someone in another room to hear. Not great.

There's also a timer function so you can schedule lights to turn on and off when you're at work or away on vacation. Just make sure you program these in advance -- you won't be able to access them on the road. The good news is that Switchmate has internal storage that keeps track of the programmed timers so they will work even when your phone isn't close enough to pair to the device.

Switchmate also has a Welcome feature that will turn on your connected lights once a day when you enter Bluetooth range.

The timers and the Welcome function both worked very well, but Switchmate is limited in terms of features. It doesn't send you notifications when a timer-enabled light turns on (something I'd like to have on an opt-in basis for peace of mind during travel), keep a log of activity, let you group switches by room, or attempt to estimate energy consumption. It doesn't work with dimmers, and it doesn't have any integrations with products/platforms/services from other manufacturers.

That puts Switchmate behind competitors like the $50 Belkin Wemo Light Switch or Lutron's $60 Caseta in-wall dimmer switch.  Yes, you have to install them, but they also work remotely over Wi-Fi and the proprietary Clear Connect standard -- well beyond Switchmate's 150-foot maximum range. They also boast integrations from Amazon, HomeKit, and other smart home leaders.

Switchmate may only cost $40 and be ridiculously easy to install and control, but it also has a lot of limitations. I want a connected light switch that integrates seamlessly into an existing panel -- or replaces it entirely. I also want to be able to control it beyond Bluetooth range, have dimming capabilities, and the option to  connect it with third party products.

Switchmate says it's developing an Amazon Alexa skill and its original Indiegogo page says it's working ""to expand the range of Switchmate so that it can be used from anywhere you have an internet  connection."" This product is decent today (especially if you want to stay away from the wires lurking behind your current light switch -- a definite bonus), but those few updates would give it more appeal."
VersaMe Starling review:|"

Stanford psychologists have spent years tracking the effects of verbally engaging infants and toddlers. Kids who get consistent interaction and those who don't are divided by a so-called language gap. This gap in speech and comprehension is evident in children as young as 18 months, and by the time kids enter kindergarten, there can be as much as a 2-year developmental disparity.

Enter Starling by VersaMe: a $200 gadget that aims to close that gap. Starling clips to your child's clothes and tracks how many words they hear each day -- a good indicator of later success. On the iOS app (an Android app is on the way), you can follow your hourly, daily, weekly and monthly patterns of interaction, and also receive notifications suggesting activities to increase it.

I love the technology behind Starling, and I'm excited for its future. But until it develops further, Starling will just feel like a $200 reminder to talk to your child.

The Starling device is well designed and sturdy. It clips to clothing easily, and its drool- and waterproof frame won't break when young children chew on it.

I also like the app, which lets you set daily goals and measure your success over time. Its daily tips offer variety, so one-way conversations with your infant don't start to feel repetitive. One tip, for instance, suggests talking your child through the emotions they're expressing, and giving them a vocabulary to articulate those feelings as they grow.

Starling is a great resource for parents who want to set their kids up for future success. But after a few weeks of using it, I can't help but wonder if the price tag is justified. Practically, the Starling's greatest value is simply its presence. Even if the goal-setting and daily tips fall by the wayside over time, as they did for me, the device itself will remain a clear and helpful reminder to consistently engage with your child.

But is that reminder really worth $200? I mean, a sticker that says ""Speak to me"" on it would have nearly the same effect, and it would cost far less.

And speaking of cost, when I began researching language development in infants for my own benefit, I found one of the most important revelations by the Stanford Center for Infant Studies: the language gap is closely connected to socioeconomic status (SES). Put simply, kids from lower SES backgrounds tend toward the lower end of the language gap.

That means the kids most in need of Starling's technology aren't the ones whose parents can afford a $200 gadget. And conversely, the parents willing to buy Starling probably will benefit less from it than others. On its website, VersaMe acknowledges the need for Starling's technology in lower SES homes, and says it plans to partner with community organizations to meet this need. Its ""Our Social Efforts"" page is currently under construction, though, so how those partnerships will actually look remains to be seen.

These critiques aren't to say Starling's technology doesn't have promise for parents interested in baby-related tech. I'm impressed that it works with all languages. I only tried it with two -- English and Spanish -- but VersaMe says it's tested it with English, Spanish, French, Polish, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese, Hebrew and others.

But just counting words won't dramatically improve how I parent. Ditto for many parents -- especially those who are intentional enough to consider buying a gadget like Starling.

What would help? Recording my word variety to help me develop my child's vocabulary over time. Giving me tips based on my speech patterns and speeds, to help me optimize my son's speech acquisition. It might seem like I'm asking too much, but developers at VersaMe say such features are within reach. It might just take updated hardware to make them a reality.

Starling was one of the devices I most looked forward to reviewing this year, but after working with it, the technology still seems to be in its infancy. The potential hasn't left Starling, but until some of the features on the horizon become realities, I'd wait to shell out $200."
Owlet Baby Monitor review:|"

When you hear the phrase ""baby monitor,"" the first thing you might think of is a set of old walkie-talkie-type devices that let you hear your sleeping child (along with some static). But the Owlet Baby Monitor, along with a wave of new devices like it, are redefining that term.

The Owlet is a two-part device. It includes a small bootie that fits on your child's foot and a base station that sits next to your bed. These two components communicate, so when the monitor senses abnormal oxygen levels or heart rate for your child, the base station then sets off an appropriate alarm. After working with the Owlet for a few days, I love the concept and performance. My wife and I really did sleep easier knowing our son's vitals were being monitored.

That said, I can't recommend the Owlet to everyone, simply because the $250 price tag is so much higher than what its straightforward features seem to justify. Plus, it just won't replace more traditional monitors that let you know if your kid wakes up at night.

The Owlet's components are well designed and durable. The socks are comfortable for babies, and they fit snugly and reliably even on squirmy children. They measure heart rate and oxygen levels with pulse oximetry -- a technology used in many hospitals.

I like the dual devices of the system. The plug-in base means the bootie recharges, rather than using replaceable batteries like some other monitors of this sort. Plus, having a separate piece for alarms lets me leave my phone silenced at night, so I don't mix up alerts regarding my son's well-being with, say, a retweet or favorite on social media.

Still, I want to see more smarts for the price before I'll be comfortable spending $250 on the Owlet. Right now, it doesn't include alerts if your child flips onto their stomach, or if your child has woken up and is crying. It also doesn't help you track any sleep patterns over time. All of these features can be found in other monitors for lower prices, and most of them wouldn't take significant changes to the Owlet's hardware.

So while I like the Owlet Baby Monitor, I can't recommend it as a priority purchase until the price drops or the feature list grows."
This Indiegogo baby monitor will let new parents return to work worry-free|"

It can be tough to leave infants or toddlers with a caretaker while you're out, whether they're family members, friends, or hired help. But that's exactly what millions of parents have to do when they go back to work soon after delivering a child. One developer, launching their Indiegogo campaign today, is hoping to make that prospect just a little less scary for new parents.

The $159 BabyBit Baby Monitor isn't like other monitors. Instead of offering information to caretakers who might just be a few rooms away from a sleeping child, the device sends information to parents who are away from the house while their child is under another's supervision.

Here's how it works. The monitor clips to a child's onesie and connects via Bluetooth to the caretaker's phone. From there, it can offer some basic information -- like if the child is crying -- for the caretaker who's watching the child. But the app also monitors things like a caretaker's distance from the child, whether the child has been crying inconsolably for a longer period of time, and other important reasons for concern. Then, in the case of any of these, the app sends a notification to parents, who can check in with the caretaker to find out how they can help.

It's a pretty simple mechanism, but it's one no other device has done. And if it works, it could be an important addition to the current market. One of my biggest fears as an absentminded parent is accidentally leaving my son in the car while I'm thinking about a work project or talking on the phone with someone. And as research has indicated, it's a mistake that can happen to anyone.

But with a device that not only notifies me if my phone goes out of close range with my son, but also notifies my wife if I stay out of range for more than, say, 3 minutes -- that could actually save lives. And if BabyBit's prototype car integration, which turns on the AC in the case of a child being left inside, also comes to fruition, the smart monitor could be a must-buy for many parents.

One of my big questions for BabyBit is whether the Bluetooth technology that responds to the proximity of users' phones will be reliable. If the notifications for parents are simply based on signal strength, then depending on the quality of the signal and the nature of the environment, it could lead to too many false alarms, or too few real alarms. I'll just have to wait to actually test BabyBit before knowing how well this feature works.

Crowd sourced projects always involve risk for investors, but according to the BabyBit team, they have a working beta unit of the monitor, and an app that is being tested and honed right now. That in combination with their backing by Jaguar Land Rover's start-up incubator gives me hope that the November release date for BabyBit is attainable. Of course, it all depends on whether the project gains support."
Roost shifts from fire to water with new smart detector|"

If something goes wrong in your home, Roost wants you to know about it wherever you are. Place the Roost Water and Freeze Detector in vulnerable spots in your house, and you'll get a push notification if it senses water, or if the temperature goes below a warning threshold.

Roost announced the $50 sensor today. You can head to the Roost site to preorder the US-only device. The Smart Water and Freeze Detector should ship out this fall.

The California-based startup's previous product, the Roost Smart Battery, fits inside your smoke detector and sends you an alert when the alarm sounds. The company also has a standalone smoke detector on the way.

With the Smart Water and Freeze Detector, Roost wants to help your smart home be ready for any potential disaster. With three years of battery life and a humidity sensor built-in with the temperature and water sensor, you'll be able to place Roost under your sink or toilet, or in the laundry room.

The Smart Water and Freeze Detector has built-in Wi-Fi, so it'll talk directly to your router and that should help keep setup time to a minimum. And it has an IFTTT channel, letting you create recipes to trigger other smart devices when something goes wrong. So if Roost senses water, your Philips Hue bulbs can flash red, for instance.

For now, the $60 Fibaro Flood Sensor is our leak detector of choice, but we've been impressed with Roost's take on smart home safety, too. If the new sensor is responsive and reliable enough to warn you before pipes freeze, before mold builds up, or before a leak has time to do serious damage, then it might make for a worthwhile addition to a connected home setup."
Philips' new location-aware Sonicare Connected toothbrush knows which teeth you're brushing|"

There are connected toothbrushes that track how long you brush. Philips Sonicare's newest model also wants to build a 3D map of your mouth.

The Philips Sonicare Flexcare Platinum Connected toothbrush, announced today, is the company's first adult brush with an app. And it has nearly as many features as its product name has letters. In addition to Bluetooth (of course), the brush adds accelerometer and gyros plus pressure sensors so it can tell what direction and angle the brush is facing, and how hard you're brushing. It shows this data and maps it against a 3D tooth map on an iPhone or Android app for real-time feedback as the brushing happens. I went to check out the brush, briefly, because I was curious. But I didn't get to brush with it.

The brush and app can handle personalized dental hygiene regimens, according to Philips. You can customize areas to target in the connected tooth-map phone app. This will also track your brushing habits over time. The brush senses which tooth you're near, and advises accordingly in-app. A dental hygienist could go over the personal tooth-map with the patient and address the trouble areas, and the brush would incorporate that extra coaching in the daily guidance. Extra attention to one tooth, or maybe taking it easy on the rear ones that just got crowns.

Besides location sensors, Philips' connected brush has features of the existing top-end Sonicate brush, the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Platinum Sonic: pressure sensors with vibrating feedback, three brushing modes with different intensity levels, and a two-minute timer.

Away from a phone the toothbrush won't handle the location-based brush guidance, but will do everything else and sync back to the phone app (it can last two weeks on a charge).

The brush costs $199.99 and is coming out later this summer. International pricing isn't available but this converts to about £138 or AU$267. I didn't get a chance to brush with one, but I watched a brief demo of how the brush recognizes location and position. I'm a pretty lax brusher, and I have no idea how my dentist would feel about this brush. Philips claims that people who have tested learned to brush better. Will it train me? I have no idea, but I'm curious. I'm just not sure I could put up with the hassle."
Philips Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit review:|"

On one end of the smart bulb spectrum, you've got relatively inexpensive lights that don't change colors. On the other end, you've got fancy lights that do. Philips Hue makes both, but for what seems like ages, they've been ignoring the middle ground: reasonably priced ""color tunable"" bulbs that don't change colors, but instead, offer a full array of natural, white-light tones. In the meantime, competitors like Lifx, GE, Osram, and Stack have all beaten Philips to the punch.

The Philips Hue White Ambiance LEDs aim to change all of that. They won't put out light in pink, purple, or green like other Hue bulbs, but they will shift color temperatures within that white-light spectrum: warm, candle-like tones at one end and cool, bluish-white daylight tones at the other. The cost per bulb? $30, with a two-bulb starter kit available for $130 (the White Ambiance LEDs aren't available outside of the US just yet, but other Hue products are -- those prices convert to roughly £20/AU$40 per bulb, or £90/AU$180 for the kit).

For the extra cash, the starter kit comes with a handy wireless remote as well as the second-gen Hue Bridge, which brings Apple HomeKit support into the picture. That means you'll be able to control the bulbs with Siri commands alongside other HomeKit-compatible smart home gadgets. And, if HomeKit isn't your platform of choice, you've got a number of other Hue-compatible third parties to work with, including IFTTT, Wink, SmartThings, Nest, and Amazon's Alexa.

That broad compatibility has always been one of Hue's best selling points, but keep in mind that the competition has done a lot of catching up in the last year or so. And, as for brightness, almost all of them have flat-out passed Philips by. Specifically, I'd point to the sensor-powered Stack LED downlights and the Lifx White 800 LED as strong alternatives -- and arguably better ones if you aren't married to HomeKit.

Oh, you know, not too much. The new bulbs look like the old ones, and the new white light spectrum controls have actually been a feature of the full-color Hue bulbs since the very beginning. At $30 a piece, they're essentially taking the place of the soft-white-only Philips Hue Lux bulbs, which were phased out last year.

There is a new Philips Hue app, available for both Android and iOS devices. It adds in new lighting scene presets for your bulbs, including white-spectrum-specific presets like ""Concentrate"" and ""Relax."" It also borrows a page from the HomeKit playbook and lets you group bulbs by room. Aside from that, a lot of the differences are purely cosmetic -- though to its credit, it is a better-looking app than before.

More than anything, the new app seems to be optimized around Hue's integration with HomeKit. There's an expanded section in the settings that'll hand control of your bulbs and scenes over to Siri, complete with instructions on how to help Siri understand your lighting commands. When you want to add a new room in the app, it asks if you'd like to import a room from your HomeKit setup. You can run HomeKit-esque lighting ""routines"" for things like waking up and heading to bed. If last year's debut of the second-gen Hue Bridge represented a marriage of sorts for Apple and Philips, then the new app reaffirms the vows.

You can change the color temperature of the Philips Hue White Ambiance LEDs with just a few taps in the app. Like in the old app, you'll drag a little cursor to the specific tone that you want, though the new app omits the full RGB color spectrum with these white-light-only bulbs, and gives you a full-screen white-light spectrum, instead. Nice touch.

But a good smart lighting setup shouldn't be too reliant on an app -- ideally, you'll be able to automate lighting changes that anticipate your needs, saving you the trouble of pulling your phone out of your pocket. To this end, Hue's new timed routines are a good step in the right direction, especially the location-aware routines that track your phone to run automatically as you leave and come home.

It also helps that Hue's LEDs are about as bullish on voice control as bulbs come. Aside from the integration with Siri, Philips Hue setups enjoy native support from Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled virtual assistant. Philips is wise to position itself at the front of the curve here -- voice-activated lighting can quickly make app controls feel antiquated.

I've got just one qualm here: Siri doesn't have a vocabulary for the white light spectrum. Ask her to set a bulb to ""daylight,"" or ""soft white,"" or ""2,700 K,"" and nothing will happen. She has no idea what those terms mean.

That's a bit baffling, frankly. Philips Hue was an early and enthusiastic member of the HomeKit bandwagon, and that white light spectrum's been there from the beginning. Maybe teaching Siri to recognize thousands of specific color temperatures is a bit much, but would it have been so hard to let her know what ""daylight"" means? The color tunability and the Siri compatibility are the two top selling points here -- why is there a wall between them?

Fortunately, there's a workaround: Hue's scenes. Tell Siri to run one of those scenes, and she'll fire it off without incident, even if it includes color temperature changes. This includes those native Hue scenes, like the ""Concentrate"" mode I mentioned before. Still, that means you have to have a scene ready before the mood strikes to ask Siri to change up your lighting, which obviously isn't ideal.

I asked Philips about this, and a company spokesperson told me that it's something they're working with Apple to fix. On the Apple front, the company declined to comment.

As for the hardware itself, the Hue White Ambiance LEDs are 10W bulbs that list the light output at 800 lumens -- roughly what you'd expect from an ordinary 60W bulb.

But scroll down to the specs on the Philips Hue website. You'll see that the brightness level varies by color temperature, and that you only get to 800 lumens at a setting of 4,000 K. At 2,700 K -- the setting the bulb defaults to every time you switch it on -- the lumen count is listed at 570.

It was even lower than that when I tested the bulbs out using our spectrometer and integrating sphere setup. At 2,700 K, the bulbs came in at just 451 lumens, putting them right in line with a 40W incandescent, not a 60W one.

At the warmest setting (roughly 2,200 K), the brightness dipped all the way to 290 -- definitely dim, but forgivable since you're basically emulating candle-light at that point. At the other end of the spectrum, the bulb clocked in at 403 lumens at its hottest color temperature setting (roughly 5,600 K).

With the default color temperature and both extremes sorted out, I set out to see if I could find that 4,000 K setting and the 800 lumens that are supposed to come with it. After several minutes spent scouring the spectrum in the Hue app, the brightest setting I could find manually came in at 616 lumens.

These are pretty bad results across the board -- so much so that I made sure to repeat the tests with each of the two bulbs in my starter kit. I then went back and retested some old bulbs to make sure my equipment was calibrated correctly. It was. Bottom line: the Hue Ambiance LEDs aren't as bright as they probably ought to be given the numbers on the box.

The Philips Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit is yet another avenue into the larger Hue ecosystem, and that's probably the point. Philips wants that Hue Bridge in as many homes as possible, and putting out a variety of different starter kits with different feature sets and price points seems like the right strategy.

Still, the White Ambiance kits might be in a tricky spot. If you just want the cheapest kit that comes with a Hue Bridge, then your best bet is to skip the color-tuning ambiance and go with the $80 Hue White kit. And, if you want to splurge on something a little more feature rich, then the full-color, $200 kit that comes with a third bulb is probably worth your while.

And, of course, Hue isn't alone in the category -- not with color-changing bulbs, and not with color tunable ones, either. In fact, it faces some fairly strong competition from the likes of Lifx and Stack, both of which offer comparably-priced color tunable bulbs that outperformed the Hue White Ambiance LEDs in my tests. Neither one will work with HomeKit, but each one has a lot to offer in its own right, and deserves a look before buying in with Hue."
Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper with SmartConnect review:|"

I started reviewing baby-related technology a few weeks after my wife delivered our first child. But dealing with the forced frugality of early parenthood (our ""Friday-night-movie"" money has been reallocated into ""diapers-and-wipes"" money) at the same time as testing the trendiest and priciest infant tech has made me reluctant to label any products ""must-buy.""

Then I put my infant son in the Fisher-Price Deluxe Newborn Auto Rock 'n Play Sleeper with SmartConnect (or if you hate long product names like I do, the SmartConnect Sleeper). It's a simple sleeper that works during the first year or so of your baby's life. It keeps them comfortably on their back to avoid SIDS, and features a curved base so parents can rock their children to sleep. More notably, the SmartConnect Sleeper offers automated movement that helps soothe your child as well as a Bluetooth-connected app so you can do so hands-free. And did I mention the cost? The sleeper is $100, a surprisingly reasonable price when similar products without the smarts can cost as much as $150.

Every baby's needs are different, but the SmartConnect Sleeper offers enough features to appeal to most parents. Personally, after testing and living with the sleeper for a couple weeks, my family's having a hard time adjusting to life without it. It's well worth a $100 investment if you're in need of a little calm in the hectic life of new parenthood. For that reason, the SmartConnect Sleeper has earned CNET's Editors' Choice Award.

The Fisher-Price SmartConnect Sleeper has a pretty standard basic design. The plush material that cradles your baby is comfortable and breathes well. The sleeper rocks on the curved tracks at its base. You can even attach the included textured plastic rings to the harness so your baby can receive tactile stimulation while falling asleep.

Here's where the smarts come in: On the side of the sleeper, a control panel allows you to queue music, ambient sound, vibration and rocking. This control panel is replicated on the iOS and Android-compatible app with more precision -- you can control vibration patterns and intensity, rocking speed and even specify particular environmental sound effects.

Other devices feature vibration and speakers (although SmartConnect's are better than most of the competitors' I've tried out). The novel addition is the automatic rocking. A short leg extends from the bottom of one of the sleeper tracks and rocks the baby. It's a simple mechanism, but it moves the baby like you do when you're rocking them to sleep.

While some devices, such as the 4moms MamaRoo, have attempted to replicate parental movements to nominal effect, the SmartConnect Sleeper consistently calmed my 10-week-old son and kept him asleep much more reliably. Whether this was due to the better seat design or the rocking pattern, I didn't really care -- the important thing was, I got more sleep at night and was more alert during the day.

The last feature I love is a small one on the app: the ability to set timers for the settings (however, the timers only work for 30-minute increments). For example, you could set the music to play for 30 minutes and vibration to continue for 60 minutes. Sure, this is a simple mechanism, but it's these small touches that make the SmartConnect Sleeper so consistently meet the needs of parents and reduce the chances that you might accidentally wake the baby.

I can think of a few features I'd like to see SmartConnect add in the future. First off, you can't play your own music through the speaker. There's no auxiliary input, no Bluetooth playability -- nothing. Custom music should be standard for devices of this sort, but almost no developers are doing it (and when they do, the speakers are worse than my phone's).

I'd also like to see some kind of basic movement monitor, so if your baby starts kicking like they're waking up, the sleeper automatically begins rocking.

Small additions like these wouldn't dramatically raise the overhead of the sleeper. And given the already modest price for a device of this sort, these are less critiques than suggestions for making a great product even better.

Short answer: absolutely.

When you have a baby, two basic products will make you shell out the big bucks: a car seat and a sleeper. My wife and I have tried out five different bassinets, co-sleepers and sleepers that ranged from $50 to $150. Of those five, the Fisher-Price SmartConnect Sleeper kept our son comfortable and asleep the most consistently. He even enjoyed sitting in it while awake -- even more so than both our baby seats.

Sure, Fisher-Price's sleeper doesn't do everything, but it does the important things well, and for a reasonable price. If you're a new parent looking for a sleeper, this is the one for you."
Stack LED Downlight Starter Kit review:|"

About 17 months ago at  	CES 2015, we got our first look at a prototype of Stack Lighting's Nest-compatible, sensor-equipped smart bulb, known at the time as the Alba LED. Since then, Stack has ditched the ""Alba"" moniker (it's just the Stack Downlight now, with A-shaped ""Stack Classic LEDs"" on the way this September). The price of a two-bulb starter kit is lower now, too, down from $150 to $99, with additional bulbs selling for $45 a piece.

That makes Stack more affordable than both  	Lifx and Philips Hue -- and I'd argue that Stack's bulbs are smarter than both. No, they won't change colors, but they will change color temperatures, offering a yellowy 2,700 K, a bluish-white 6,500 K, or anything in between. Put the bulbs into ""Auto Mode,"" and they'll automatically adjust their own brightness and tone throughout the day using built-in ambient light sensors. There's also a presence sensor in each bulb -- if they see you walking into a room, the lights will fade on automatically to light your way.

There's really not much to dislike about these bulbs. They offer a good mix of features that all work as promised, with app controls that do an admirable job of hitting the sweet spot between comprehensive and easy-to-use. What's more, they'll work with your Nest thermostat, cleverly telling it to crank the heat a little higher if they spot you in a room that tends to stay colder than the rest of the house. You can also automate the bulbs on  	IFTTT, which lets you sync them up with a wide variety of other popular smart home services and gadgets, including Amazon's Alexa. At $45 a piece, Stack's bulbs aren't cheap, but they still make one of the strongest cases for smart lighting we've seen to date.

Getting started with Stack is pretty simple -- just download the app and plug in the hub (it's yet another hunk of white plastic, but hey, at least it's hexagonal). From there, the app will ask you to name each room where you'll be installing smart lights. Once you do, you'll add bulbs to each one.

And that's how the app keeps things organized: by room. That applies to the controls, too. Instead of controlling individual bulbs, you control an entire room's worth of bulbs 	 at the same time. I'm not a fan of this blanket approach -- there are definitely times when you want to be able to turn one light on in a room without turning all of the lights on. Of course, you could list each individual bulb as its own ""room"" as a workaround, but that's a pretty clunky solution.

Once you've gotten your lights organized, you can dial the brightness and color temperature of each room up and down or assign them to one of three color temperature presets. There's also an Auto mode that will let each bulb adjust its own brightness and color temperature settings throughout the day based on the time and the ambient light conditions in the room.

By default, the lights will automatically turn on when they detect motion, then automatically turn off after motion is stopped. If you want, you can tell certain rooms to stay lit for longer after motion stops, or just disable the auto-off feature altogether.

You'll find a similar depth of control with the rest of Stack's features. An alarm feature lets you set the lights to wake you up at a certain time each morning -- you can customize things like the quality of light, the range of brightness and the amount of time it'll take to fade to full blast. In the app's scheduling mode, you can program the lights to behave in different ways at different times of the day. Put the app into sleep mode, and any bathroom or hallway lights will switch into a fully customizable nightlight setting when they detect motion.

The controls aren't perfect, though. I couldn't find a way to set that sleep mode to run automatically each night, for instance, or a way to trigger it from outside of the app. And manually adjusting each room's lighting felt sluggish to the touch, with narrow, over-sensitive sliders that make it tough to hit precise settings.

Still, the idea is that you shouldn't need to use the app very much at all once you have things set up the way you want them. For the most part, Stack's bulbs lived up to that promise. For instance, I installed a few in a hallway that leads to the garage at  the CNET Smart Home -- whenever I'd come and go, the bulbs worked as I had programmed them to work. I also appreciated that as soon as one bulb's motion detector spotted me, all of the bulbs in the room would fade on at once, and in perfect synchronization.

The bulbs also did well when I tested them out using our lighting lab's  spectrometer and integrating sphere. Stack claims that its floodlight puts out 750 lumens -- at its brightest setting (roughly 5,000 K), I clocked it at 723 lumens, which is well within our setup's margin of error. The color temperatures were also mostly accurate, though more so at the lower, yellowy end of the spectrum than at the high, bluish end (the app claims you can go as high as 6,500 K, but I couldn't get a reading any hotter than 5,000 K).

The Stack LEDs also did very well in our dimming tests, where they dropped smoothly down to 0.3 percent brightness (just 2 lumens) at the app's lowest setting, all without flickering one bit. Heat management was another notable strong point -- after 90 minutes in the sphere, the Stack bulb's brightness had only dipped to 94.2 percent  of the initial reading.

Anything above 90 percent in that test is a terrific result, and 94.2 percent is better than any smart bulb I've ever tested. It tells us that the bulb performs well even after it gets hot, which means it might be an especially good pick for an enclosed fixture, where heat gets trapped.

The last things I tested were Stack's integrations with Nest and with IFTTT. Both were a cinch to set up. Just go to the ""Integrations"" section in the Stack app, tap the service with which you want to sync up and enter your password.

The Nest integration opens up a new screen in the Stack app where you label each of the rooms you've set up with a temperature rating -- cooler, average, or warmer. If you set a room to cooler or warmer than average, then Stack's bulbs will tell your Nest thermostat to crank things up or down as needed when their motion sensors sense you in that room. It's a really clever little trick -- and a legitimate functionality upgrade for Nest owners. And if you use  Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, you can set the the lights to flash a warning if anything's ever amiss.

On the IFTTT side of things, you can use any IFTTT-compatible service or gadget to trigger a lighting change. You could, for instance, create an automation recipe that flashes your lights whenever it's time for an appointment on your Google Calendar, or one that lets you turn things on and off by asking Alexa.

Stack's LED Downlights are a big step in the right direction for the smart lighting category. At $45 each (or $99 for the two-bulb starter kit) they cost less than Lifx and Philips Hue's smart floodlights, and they arguably have more to offer thanks to the on-board sensor tech in each bulb. I didn't have any trouble setting them up or using them, and I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the app's controls. Integrations with Nest and with IFTTT only helped take things to the next level. If you're looking to buy into smart lighting, keep Stack on your shortlist."
Aquanta will help your water heater learn your habits|"

The second largest energy suck in residential homes is the water heater -- nearly one-fifth of your monthly power bill, according to one study. Turns out it takes a lot of energy to keep hot water on standby for when you need it.

Enter Aquanta. At $150, it's a retrofit gadget that connects to your water heater to make it more energy efficient. How? By learning user patterns -- like when you tend to shower or fill up the dishwasher. The result? Hot water when you need it, less wasted energy when you don't.

It's a simple idea, and one that's been applied successfully to other parts of the smart home, like thermostats. If it works, Aquanta could have a shot at Nest-like success.

Aquanta Inc. (the company and the product share a name) says water heaters are simpler in some ways to automate than thermostats. The simplicity is a result of their binary nature. Either they're on or off. So the Aquanta device doesn't have to do much automation other than control the power switch or ignition.

Where the smarts come in is with energy monitoring and device scheduling. Aquanta Inc. uses what they call an Enthalpy Sensor, which measures the changes in energy inside the water heater. This sensor lets the device gauge how much energy is lost by maintaining the heat of standing water. Aquanta also tracks water entering the water heater to help measure how many gallons of water are being used.

Together, these two sensors help Aquanta learn your hot water usage, and over time lower your energy waste. Ideally, that could mean plenty of hot water for showers in the morning, but during the day with kids at school and parents at work, hot water will be kept at a reasonable minimum -- enough for an impromptu shower, but not an excessive amount, according to the developer.

Adding smarts to water heaters is a patently good idea. Especially if, as the company claims, Aquanta really works with up to 85 percent of American water heaters, and if it really cuts enough wasted energy to significantly affect your electricity bill. That said, Aquanta has me asking a few questions.

First off, the app to control the device isn't an app at all. It's a website you have to access via Web browser. Sure, users shouldn't have to log into the control center often if everything works as planned. But if something does go wrong, I want solutions and control at my fingertips in seconds.

The other question I've got is about performance. Nest, the thermostat that popularized learning algorithms in smart home tech, worked well -- but when it didn't work, it wasn't a huge deal. If Nest turned the temperature too low during the evening, you could just adjust the thermostat in the hallway. If Aquanta runs low on hot water when you stop at home to shower before an afternoon meeting, it could be a lot more inconvenient.

Both of these problems could be minor, though, depending on the execution of the product. And I can afford Aquanta a little breathing room on some of these features, because nobody else is attempting what it is. If this device can surmount these flaws, it could be a must-buy for the eco-conscious smart home owner."
This is the smartest makeup mirror we've ever seen|"

Simplehuman, a manufacturer of everyday household items ranging from a $26 paper towel holder to the $400 Wi-Fi Wide-View Sensor Mirror, just released a new product -- the $250 Sensor Mirror Pro.

The Sensor Mirror Pro has a lot of the basic stuff you'd expect from a pricey vanity mirror. It comes with 5x and 10x magnification for applying things up close and personal -- think liquid eyeliner, eyelash curling, foundation contouring -- and any other makeup application or general personal grooming that would be easier in tight focus.

It also has a ""tru-lux light system"" with a color rendering index (CRI) of 90. Check out this overview of CRI scores for more details, but generally the closer the number is to 100, the better a light approximates natural light. Professional hair and makeup artist Cynthia Laws told me that daylight is the best case scenario for applying makeup, so a CRI score of 90 seems like a very good sign for this mirror.

In addition, the mirror's built-in LEDs are designed to light up automatically when it detects your presence. This feature is also available with the Wide-View Sensor Mirror, but it didn't always work. The lights would shut off unexpectedly when I was applying makeup on occasion (see the video review below). Hopefully Simplehuman made some improvements with this latest iteration.

This new mirror also does some things you wouldn't expect. It has an app and an IFTTT channel so you can create custom rules like, ""If it's overcast out, then set the Simplehuman Sensor Mirror Pro to overcast preset."" Nest also added Simplehuman to its Works with Nest smart-home integrations platform on May 17. With this partnership, you're supposed to be able to sync the light settings from your Nest Cam to the LEDs in your Sensor Mirror Pro.

Simplehuman also has plans to add Amazon Alexa integration into the mix in early June. While this isn't available just yet, you should be able to say things like, ""Alexa, ask the mirror to set brightness to 50 percent"" and ""Alexa, ask the mirror to use the office setting."" I'm not convinced that these smart features add much value, but it will be fun to test them out all the same. Stay tuned."
Cane Wireless Cliki review:|"

Smart buttons are hard explain, partly because they look so different depending on who's using them. You can control the music on your phone, toggle the smart lights in your house, order a pizza, and more -- all with the press of a button. At it's best, using smart buttons can feel magical.

But when it comes to reviewing any particular smart button, the process is strictly scientific: How flexible is it? How many functions can it perform? How many platforms does it work with? These are the simple building blocks that construct the user experience.

Cliki, a new smart button by Florida-based Cane Wireless, is Android-exclusive and can perform thirteen distinct functions. It sends commands to your phone -- to take a picture or toggle tethering -- and it does so reliably. The problem is, for a $39 product, Cliki should do so much more.

Cliki does a few things well. First off, you can attach Cliki to your keychain and use it as a fob. To me, that feels much more useful than the adhesive strips that other smart buttons have used. The Cliki app is also efficient. Rather than programming the button one command at a time, the commands are grouped into sets. That way, when you select the music icon, your button will automatically be able to play/pause your music with one press, and skip to the next song with a double press. Grouping commands in this way makes transitioning between button uses really easy.

The problem is, these pros are minor when compared to the shortcomings. To get at the heart of Cliki's problems, let's compare it with another smart button that costs a little less -- the Shortcut Labs Flic.

On every level, Flic outperforms Cliki. An especially important note is Cliki's lack of IFTTT integration. What IFTTT allows is vastly increased flexibility, and further device reach. Rather than simply controlling your phone's functions, IFTTT allows you to connect a smart button to home devices like smart LEDs or a smart garage door opener. It also lets you integrate uncooperative apps, adding a whole new web of potential connections. And Cliki can't access any of it.

At this point, you might be wondering if there's any reason to buy Cliki. And the answer for now is no. But Cliki is adding IFTTT integration, iOS compatibility, and more features later this year. These additions, in combination with its quality app, will make Cliki much more competitive with buttons like Flic.

While it's hard to recommend Cliki to anyone right now, it's a device to watch. In under a year, it could be competing with the best smart buttons on the market."
Knocki believes the ideal smart home is just a tap away|"

Houston, Texas-based startup Knocki wants to simplify your smart home. Rather than switching feverishly among apps, voice control devices and assorted multifunction buttons to keep your connected home in check, the team of two instead came up with Knocki, available for preorder now on Kickstarter starting at $69/£45/AU$95.

A puck-shaped Wi-Fi gizmo with built-in vibration-sensing tech, Knocki is designed to go pretty much anywhere inside your home. Use the included adhesive tape to stick one under a table, attach one to a wall, hide one inside a cabinet -- or behind a door. I'm a little skeptical about the staying power of an adhesive-mounted product that looks slightly larger than palm-size, but the team also provides mounting hardware for a more permanent installation.

Knocki promises an easy configuration that's as simple as downloading the companion app on your Android or iPhone and entering your Wi-Fi credentials. From there, you're supposed to be able to assign up to 10 custom ""gestures"" to a single Knocki.

Since the team claims upcoming support with the likes of IFTTT, Nest, Belkin WeMo, SmartThings, Philips Hue and other smart-home brands at launch, one Knocki can seemingly control a whole lot of stuff.

A double tap, for instance, could turn on your LEDs, two taps followed by a triple tap could unlock your integrated deadbolt, and a triple tap could dim your LEDs and turn on your TV. And that's only 3 of the 10 possible gestures you can create per Knocki device.

This quirky gizmo is also supposed to be able to know the difference between a deliberate tap and an accidental tap (I can't wait to test this out). And even if you don't have smart products at home, Knocki should be able to control music or find your phone, too.

We haven't seen anything quite like Knocki before. Sure, Shortcut Labs' $34 Flic button is similar, but Knocki is using vibrations to determine which device or devices to control rather than Flic's button presses.

The campaign ends on July 2, so there's time to get an early production version of Knocki. The $59 price tier is already sold out, but you can still snag one for $69/£45/AU$95 (the price will jump up to $129 when it officially hits retail). Knocki units will ship worldwide and are slated for delivery this December."
Withings Smart Kid Scale review:|"

Tracking your newborn's growth is one of the best ways to make sure they're staying healthy. Many people use rough estimates -- stepping on the bathroom scale with and without the child and calculating the difference -- or frequent trips to the pediatrician. With the hopes of cutting down on parents' concerns and the medical bills that come with undernutrition, Withings is offering the $180, app-connected Smart Kid Scale.

What makes the Kid Scale so smart? It connects via Bluetooth to your phone, so you can track your child's growth over time. The Withings Baby app not only tracks weight gain and loss, but also feeding patterns. This isn't as comprehensive an app as, say, Hatch Baby's. But using it is intuitive, and you can follow the progress of multiple children at once.

The Scale itself, despite a clever design, feels a little less smart. You can remove the attached cradle once your child can stand, so they can just step onto the scale like a grown-up. This flexibility means you can use the device for at least a few years. But the 55-pound limit means it won't last as long as I'd like. And that's about the extent of the device's smarts.

When you can buy a reliable bathroom scale for $30, it's hard to justify spending $180 on a scale for young children. The Withings Smart Kid Scale might appeal to parents of children with known health concerns, but most parents will be better off with the periodic pediatric visits they already have written in their calendars."
Black+Decker launches new Bluetooth-connected batteries|"

Black+Decker, the company known for its power drills and other tools, has just announced a new smart product: the Smartech Battery. This Bluetooth-connected battery will work with all current Black+Decker 20V MAX tools, and the company says it is available now at Menard's, Lowe's, and on Amazon for $70 (converted, that's about £50 or AU$95; international retailers haven't been confirmed).

Smartech Batteries will work with the Black+Decker iOS and Android app, meaning people can control the batteries and, therefore, their tools, wirelessly. First, you can enable and disable any of these batteries while in range. That means no one can use any battery-powered tools lying around the garage during a project unless you enable the batteries via the app. You can also use the app to view battery life, use a ""locate"" feature to find missing batteries and activate each battery's USB port. The app has other components like a message center for notifications from batteries and a ""Projects"" section that is supposed to offer insight into construction and ideas for DIYers.

This new Bluetooth connectivity seems promising. The disabling and location features could be welcome additions for anyone with kids around the house and a garage that sometimes falls into disarray. But for many people who don't want to fiddle with an app in the middle of a project, these devices could just be a hassle. Will Bluetooth features contribute to the quality of Black+Decker's products without making them less easy to use? We'll have to see for ourselves."
Home8 prioritizes security with its Smart Garage device|"

Many people use their garage as much as their front door, so buying a device to remotely control or automate it seems like a pretty logical investment. But a new company called Home8 says simple app-connectedness isn't enough -- security is just as important. Enter the Smart Garage Starter Kit.

At $230, the Starter Kit costs about $30 more than Garageio and $100 more than the Chamberlain MyQ. But unlike both of those competitors, Home8's kit includes security gadgets, like a camera and an alarm. For anyone worried that the garage isn't just another door, but also another home security vulnerability, the Home8 Smart Garage Starter Kit could be a useful solution.

The Kit will contain three devices. First, you'll get the garage door opener itself. This will connect with the electric opener already in place, adding smarts retroactively. The second device is the Shuttle Intelligent Hub, which will act as a bridge between your phone and the opener. That means you'll be able to control your garage remotely. In addition, the Hub contains an alarm, so you'll be alerted in the case of a break-in.

The final device in the package is a Mini Cube HD camera. The camera itself is proprietary, so how well it works remains to be seen. But with 720p resolution, a ball-and-socket mount for manual swiveling, motion detection, night vision and two-way audio, it seems to have its bases covered.

While the $230 price tag feels a little high at first glance, for a high-quality camera and a connected garage door opener, it could be a great deal. The Starter Kit also works with integration platform IFTTT, and Home8 is working on Amazon Echo compatibility as well.

Between these strategic smart-home integrations and the security-centric approach to garage door automation, Home8 is taking a big step in the right direction. Now the question is whether the Smart Garage Starter Kit's performance will match the idea behind it."
4moms Infant Tub review:|"

If you've had a baby, one of the gifts you probably got at the shower was an infant tub. They're bulky, usually colorful, plastic bins that might feature netting to cradle the baby, or a foam pad to keep them from slipping around. And if you've tried to use one of these before, you probably know it doesn't make baby baths much easier. Once you're a few weeks into parenting, with sleep running low and stress running high, you're probably as likely to just use the sink as a bathtub as you are to pull out one of these tubs.

Enter 4moms, the maker of MamaRoo, with a $50 (£35 or AU$68) smart Infant Tub. This device is as bulky as competitors, and it costs about twice as much, but it benefits from really clever design and simple but well implemented smarts.

First, you start the faucet over the thermometer.

Once the screen turns green, indicating a comfortable temperature for your child, you can plug the bottom of the first pool. This will redirect the water into the tub where your baby sits.

Finally, with your baby secure on the foam pad that keeps them from slipping, you can use the included cup to pour water over any body parts that need cleaning and aren't submerged.

I like the basic design of the Infant Tub -- it keeps your baby in place pretty well, and it keeps the water at the perfect temperature, taking that extra concern off your mind while you try to hold a wiggling baby. The screen and temperature sensing are also helpful. For the future, though, including some sort of tool to clean harder-to-access places like clenched fists could help the $50 price tag feel like a better deal. And reducing its size would make storage much easier.

Although some of its shortcomings mean the 4moms Infant Tub isn't quite a must-buy product yet, for anyone who needs assistance washing their baby, the 4moms Infant Tub is a solid investment."
Tikteck Multi-Color Bluetooth LED review:|"

Color-changing smart bulbs are often stupid expensive, but the $10 Tikteck LED is an exception. At a fraction of what you'd expect to spend on bulbs from Lifx or Philips Hue, Tikteck's Bluetooth LED offers app-enabled color control, along with a scheduling feature that'll program the bulb to turn on or change colors at a specific time.

Mind you, this is a simple, unexceptional smart bulb we're talking about, with a generic-looking app that won't work with Nest, IFTTT, Alexa, Apple HomeKit, or any other notable third party. If that's the sort of smart-home integration you're after, then you're better off splurging on a better-connected bulb. That said, as far as basic, bargain-priced novelties go, Tikteck gets the job done better than you might expect. And hey, ""Hue for cheapskates"" isn't the worst pitch I've ever heard.

The Tikteck LED's packaging pegs it at 600 lumens, but I clocked it at 424 lumens at its default white-light setting (about as much as you'd expect from a 40W incandescent), with a color temperature of roughly 3,500 K. You can dial the color temperature up to around 5,500 K or down to about 2,800 K, but the brightness dips either way. You can also dim the bulb cleanly down to zero right in the app.

The Tikteck app also gives you a color wheel. Tap one of its colors, and the bulb will follow suit. I don't like that the app gives no indication of the currently selected shade, but it's quick and responsive to use, and the bulb's colors are vivid and more accurate than I'd honestly expected. They weren't very bright, though, none of them registering above 100 lumens. That's good enough for mood lighting, or maybe accent lighting at a party, but not much else.

Aside from the controls for brightness, color and color temperature, the app has a variable-speed color-cycling mode that works fine, a nightlight mode that simply dims the bulb way down, and a music syncing mode that I couldn't get to work at all. You can also schedule lighting changes that will run even if your phone is out of Bluetooth range, or out of battery -- a nice touch for anyone looking to use this thing as a wake-up light. And sure, Tikteck's smarts are nowhere near as sophisticated as what you'll get with Lifx or Philips Hue, but at $10 a pop, that really doesn't matter too much. If color-changing lights have tempted you in the past, but the high prices have turned you off, then maybe this is the bulb you've been waiting for."
4moms mamaRoo review:|"

In the weeks before the birth of our first child, my wife and I emptied our bank accounts buying every baby accessory we could imagine using even once or twice. After our son was born, we spent hours repackaging and returning a lot of them, because we found out the kid had his own preferences. He hated the first bassinet we bought for him, but loved the swaddling cloths. He hates to be cold, but he likes baths. And during this process, figuring out which devices to invest in took some experimentation.

At $270 (about £186 or AU$361), the 4moms MamaRoo is an expensive experiment -- especially for new parents being bombarded with medical bills and nighttime diaper runs -- but it's one that could pay off. Essentially, the device is a Bluetooth-connected chair that, according the advertisements, ""moves like you do."" 4moms attempted to replicate the range of movement patterns and speed that parents use to rock their children to sleep. Whether it calms your child will depend on his or her particular preferences, this base mechanic works really well.

The MamaRoo isn't a perfect product. It has major technical shortcomings --particularly with its basic mobile app and terrible speakers. Even in light of these issues, I like the MamaRoo. Unless you've got $270 lying around, though, you should wait to buy it until you're sure it's what your baby needs.

The 4moms MamaRoo is basically an adjustable seat that can rock your baby in various patterns at a few speed levels. The seat can sit up for babies getting a handle on balancing, and it can lie back for newborns. The seat itself is made of a soft multi-plush material that is gentle on the skin (though a slightly less expensive model just has a rough nylon material that you'll have to line with your own blanket), and it's machine washable.

Setting up the MamaRoo is a breeze. The instructions are clear, the pieces fit together simply, and connecting it to your phone with Bluetooth will take a minute at most. I had my MamaRoo up and running in less than 10 minutes.

MamaRoo also features a hanging mobile, speakers, and sound effects to calm the baby. You can control the volume, select the sound effects, adjust the movement speed, and choose the movement pattern, all from an app. It's like you get an extra pair of arms to rock your baby, and it's mostly hands-free for you.

My wife parents full-time, I help as much as I can, and our son is surprisingly relaxed. But we still felt the relief of having a device that rocked and engaged him. For fussier kids or busier parents, MamaRoo could be a lifesaver.

For its creative and well-designed base, MamaRoo's extra features are disappointing. When I first set it up, I could imagine using it to rock my son to sleep, engage him with the mobile, stimulate him with music, and calm him with ambient sounds like a heartbeat, the ocean or rain. Besides its basic function, none of these added features worked well.

The mobile has high potential for a smart baby seat. This one not only looks flimsy and basic, with three suspended balls of different color and design -- it also requires you to manually spin it. Yet the whole idea of this device is to distract kids while parents can finish a little work (or just rest). My son is curious and loves watching new and interesting things, and he was bored with the mobile in under a minute.

The second big weakness is the sound system. If I didn't know what ambient sound I was selecting, I would probably have thought they were all just slightly different patterns of white noise. When using the speaker for music instead, I was even more disappointed. Not only is the top volume about equivalent to my iPhone at 30 percent volume, but the sound quality is terrible. I could barely hear any individual strand of music besides the most percussive mid-levels.

Finally, I love the Bluetooth app control of the MamaRoo, but for some reason, even if I wanted to use my phone's music with the speaker, that doesn't have Bluetooth functionality. So to connect my music to the speaker, I have to walk over to the device, plug in my phone with the included auxiliary cord (which is only a couple of inches long), and leave my phone beside it. Given the issues with sound quality and the lack of Bluetooth speaker connection, after a day or two, I just started using my phone's speakers for music.

If you're looking for good speakers or a device to visually engage your child, then MamaRoo won't cut it. The last thing you want is a $270 investment gathering dust in a corner.

But for parents who can't seem to find any seat or bassinet that their baby likes, the 4moms MamaRoo could make those first few months manageable."
Utilitech Pro 60W Equivalent LED review:|"

I'll make this quick. This 8.5W LED from Utilitech Pro isn't the best replacement for a 60W incandescent that I've tested, but at less than $5, it's a respectable one.

Unlike a lot of other sub-$5 LED options (most notably, the Philips 60W Replacement and the GE Bright Stik LED), Utilitech Pro's bulb promises to work with dimmer switches. Sure enough, it worked with our dimmer rig, albeit with a few caveats. First, it flickered very slightly on an old rotary knob dimmer designed for use with incandescents. With newer, more LED-friendly switches, it didn't flicker at all -- but it also wouldn't shine any brighter than about 75 percent at the highest settings.

That problem is compounded by the fact that the bulb isn't terribly bright to begin with. It promises 800 lumens on the box (roughly what you'd expect from a 60W incandescent), but in our spectrometer and integrating sphere setup, it clocked in at closer to 650 lumens. That's plenty bright for an accent light, but as a sole source of illumination, you might rightly want a little more.

If I needed a dimmable LED, I'd probably spend a few dollars more on the Cree 4Flow LED, or grab a dimmable Ledare LED during my next Ikea run. Still, it's hard to be mad at a dimmable LED that's this inexpensive. At less than $5 at Lowe's (it's model 740062), Utilitech Pro's 8.5W LED isn't a bad pick in a pinch."
DuPont Corian Charging Surface review:|"

DuPont's Corian Charging Surface countertops sound like the perfect marriage of kitchen design and contemporary technology. The concept conjures the idea of a whole countertop that acts like a wireless device charger. Sounds great.

You'll need to replace your counter wholesale to add the wireless chargers, so it's no small upgrade. Once you find a local fabricator that offers the charging tech, you can expect to pay between $150 to $200 per charger, plus $60 or more per square foot of DuPont's Corian or Zodiaq countertop material. Between the costs and the commitment for prospective buyers, DuPont's charging tech has to be perfect. Our experience with a charging Zodiaq Quartz counter in the CNET Smart Home was anything but.

The charging technology isn't responsive enough even with phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7 that support wireless charging natively (both the Qi and PMA standard that the DuPont chargers support). With the plug-in rings that grant wireless charging to iPhones and other devices without native support, you'll spend so much time searching for the exact, pin-point spot that makes the charging connection, you're better off just tracking down a cable.

As much as I like the idea of a carefree, countertop-charging existence, DuPont's Corian Charging Counter Surface will only bring frustration and regret. Stick with standalone charging mats.

This was my first question when I heard how much it cost to install a DuPont Corian Charging Surface. The Corian countertops themselves aren't too expensive, comparatively. Sixty bucks per square foot is about midrange, and like any surface, it comes with pros and cons. From a design standpoint, the countertops look fine. It's an acrylic material, and surface-level scratches can be buffed out easily. But it's susceptible to heat damage, unlike higher-end stone counters.

We installed Zodiaq Quartz countertops at the Smart Home, which will set you back $75-$90 per square foot, but it looks sharper and boasts better durability. Deciding whether to purchase DuPont Corian or Zodiaq surfaces will just depend on your budget and particular kitchen needs.

The price that really stands out to me, though, is that of the chargers. Ostensibly, the high price of up to $200 per charger is earned by the convenience of wireless charging in a countertop. But that doesn't explain why the chargers cost so much more than the quality, standalone wireless chargers you can find online for $30-$60. Even chargers embedded in furniture from online stores like IKEA cost significantly less than DuPont's.

The DuPont chargers also offer almost nothing special, besides their incidental attachment to the countertop. Although DuPont says the charger is made to have greater range than most others (since it has to connect through a countertop), they end up taking more of your time than usual trying to find a charging connection. And it's not just finding the sweet spot above the charger; it's also finding the exact orientation necessary to maintain that connection.

While finding the perfect spot is usually quicker for phones with either Qi or PowerMat charging receivers built-in, (think 5 to 10 seconds), one of the two chargers in our counter took consistently longer to connect to our  Qi-based Samsung phone. At times it seemed  like both charging spots in our Charging Surface disappeared altogether. As you quickly realize using any wireless charger, it takes awhile using it to find the exact spot to get a good connection. The DuPont chargers were far worse than usual.

To use the Charging Surface without additional accessories, your phone must have wireless charging built in. Corian works with more devices than many other wireless chargers, since it's compatible with both Qi- and Powermat-enabled devices, the two big wireless charging standards. Newer Android phones don't have any issues here, but older models and all current iPhones require a Qi or PMA adapter to make the connection.

Corian offers a pack of three adapter dongles (Apple 30-pin, Mini-USB, and Apple Lightning) along with the chargers, and additional packs for $40 each. The need for adapters isn't Corian's fault, but it's an issue that will need to be solved before wireless charging becomes mainstream.

While DuPont Corian's Charging Surface does connect directly to new Android phones, it doesn't offer a Quick Charge function, a feature with which new charging cords have significantly reduced charging times. That means until such a feature is added, users making a brief stop home between errands will find more use in a Quick Charge cord than a standard-speed wireless charger like DuPont's.

Even if you're already interested in Corian countertops and see the chargers as a small added perk, reconsider. To keep track of the tiny spot where the charger makes a reliable connection, you may have to mark the countertop like we did, which will likely look tacky. For those who want wireless charging, you can get it elsewhere for much less money and commitment. For those who want convenience of furniture-embedded charging, you can find it for considerably lower prices -- just look at this $60 wireless charging nightstand.

You might be asking, ""Is it really that bad? I mean, it at least works, right?"" And that's the problem. Even against the lowest standard of performance -- whether it charges a phone -- the DuPont Corian Charging Surface is unreliable. Yes, if I stand above the counter, find the spot and place the phone carefully, I can get it to connect somewhat consistently (though less so when I'm using a Qi or PMA ring). But if I place the phone on the counter naturally, say, while walking by, I am rarely successful at achieving a connection.

None of this is to say charging countertops are a bad idea. In fact, done right, they'd be one of my favorite parts of the CNET Smart Home. DuPont Corian Charging Surfaces just don't do it right. Don't splurge on this until either the tech or DuPont's design improves."
The One Smart Piano review:|"

I played a lot of piano as a kid -- first, by figuring out how to bang out crappy versions of movie scores and TV theme songs on my grandma's Steinway, then, eventually, with actual piano lessons (my family could only tolerate my rendition of the theme from Indiana Jones so many times).

So, forgive me if the One Smart Piano gets me all nostalgic. It's a $300 compact keyboard (or a $1,500 full-size electric piano) that leverages the power of your phone or tablet to give you a more feature-rich experience. Plug your device in and open the companion app, and you'll be able to follow along with video lessons, song tutorials, and Rock Band-esque games on its screen, with LED lights in the piano's keys lighting up to guide you along the way.

If you're just looking for a keyboard that best approximates the feel of a genuine piano, you can find better than the One at both the $300 and $1,500 price points (roughly £205/£1,025 or AU$390/AU$1,965). Still, there's an awful lot to like about those app-enabled smarts -- especially if you've got kids with a budding eye or ear for music. I know 7-year-old Ry would have had a field day with the thing (and my family would have definitely appreciated the headphone jack).

The One Smart Piano is all about the app. Take that app away, and you're left with a very, very basic keyboard that offers just a volume knob and three buttons: a power switch, a button to tap through different instrument tones, and a sustain setting.

This is at least partly by design. The One's website touts the clean, minimalist look of the thing, with the usual controls stripped out and relocated into the app.

The problem with this approach is that those in-app controls aren't that easy to find. They aren't anywhere on the app's home screen -- it takes a couple of not-terribly-intuitive taps before you'll find them tucked away in a settings menu.

Outside of those core keyboard features, the One Smart Piano focuses on teaching you how to play it. For example, you can pull up interactive sheet music that highlights the notes on the screen (and with those LEDs in the keys) as you play. You can also watch one of 105 video lessons with a virtual instructor -- again, the keys will light up as he coaches you on what to play and how to play it.

There are also song tutorial videos geared towards people who prefer to play by ear. The app has a wide collection of popular songs from everyone from Ben Folds to Beyonce to the Beatles, with videos that show you exactly how to play each section of a song (and yep, the piano's keys light up to make it even easier to follow along).

Typically, the first video for each song is free, with the additional sections costing a few bucks a piece. Yep, this keyboard comes with in-app purchases. This felt a bit cheap to me -- especially considering that the exact same ""HD Piano"" videos are available on YouTube for free.

The same goes for that interactive sheet music I mentioned earlier. You get plenty of classical selections to practice with for free, but if you want to learn how to play the latest Taylor Swift song, you'll need to fork over a couple of bucks.

The good news is that there's plenty of free content across all of the app's features -- enough so that I felt more or less satisfied. I wasn't willing to pay to learn the outro to""Hey Jude,"" but since the intro/verse was free, I didn't come away feeling too upset about it.

As for the game mode, I found it to be a fun and clever way of testing your skills. There are dozens of songs to choose from, which felt like plenty, but most if not all of them are folk songs or holiday songs aimed at kids. I'd prefer a greater diversity of options.

You'll also find additional practice games hidden in the settings menu. The ear training mode offered an especially interesting twist on training: the piano plays you a note (or, if you're up to the challenge, a chord), then asks you to go and find it. That's typically a pretty tough skill to develop on your own -- with the app, you have a helpful partner.

I like this thing. It isn't going to beat the one-on-one instruction you'll get with a good piano teacher, but it will provide you with a way to gradually improve your skills, and a way to have fun doing so. It's better for kids than it is for adults (I couldn't help but cringe during the first lesson, when the instructor sang ""Hot Crossed Buns"" to me), but still offers enough to encourage anyone with an interest in learning piano to sit down and do so.

At $300, it's far from the nicest keyboard that money can buy, so if you have more serious musical aspirations, then look elsewhere. But if you or your kid is a beginner looking to learn, well, there's an app for that, and a keyboard that goes with it quite nicely. Give it a shot."
Triby shows another side of Alexa|"

We've been waiting for Alexa, the smooth-voiced, Amazon-powered digital assistant from the Echo line of speakers to make her way into other products. The first test case is a device called Triby, branded by its creator, Invoxia, as a ""smart speaker."" If that makes it sound a lot like the Amazon Echo, that's because it feels a bit like an alternate universe take on the Echo, doing much of what an Echo does -- but not everything -- while adding a handful of its own unique features.

But no one will mistake this for an Echo, which has a distinct tube-like shape with a light-up activity ring on top. Instead, the $199 Triby (£159 in the UK, not currently available in Australia) looks a bit like a vintage radio, with an e-ink screen in place of the tuning dial, and shortcut buttons for contacts and streaming radio stations in place of radio band and tuning controls. (We saw pre-production versions last November and at CES this year.)

The back panel is a giant magnet, which makes it perfect for slapping on a refrigerator or other metal surface. It's battery-powered, too, making it closer to the Amazon Tap, and Invoxia says the battery could last for up to one month between recharges.

The way Alexa has infiltrated so many lives, controlling playlists, light bulbs, and thermostats, I can see a real appeal to having easy access to her cloud-connected brain from a wide array of devices. The setup process to connect the Triby to my Alexa account was trouble-free, despite the Triby app lacking polish or detailed instructions.

But once connected to my Amazon account via the Triby and Echo apps, I could indeed ask it questions, pull in music from my Amazon library, and yes, control my Philips Hue lightbulbs. It's both reassuringly familiar and also jarring to hear Alexa's familiar voice come from this retro-looking metal box.

But the Triby never felt as smooth and responsive as an Echo. When it works, you get an awkward-sounding bing to indicate Alexa has heard her activation word, but she didn't hear me as regularly as the Echo version, and I had to repeat my requests much of the time. And for some reason the Triby was convinced we were in Seattle, and I could find no way to correct it to New York, making accurate weather reports a pain to ask for.

Sound quality is decent for a kitchen radio, but not quite as good as the Echo itself, which is already not a favorite of audiophiles. For news and talk radio streams, it was fine, but music lacked depth and character.

Using the Triby as a speakerphone was an exercise in frustration. When placing a call, the remote party often could hear me only intermittently -- even after I selected the Triby as my Bluetooth device, the call didn't always transfer to the device. After several test calls, I'd call it generally unreliable as a speakerphone.

I had better luck using the two built-in telephone-shaped buttons to call contacts on my approved Triby list -- using the device to make an VoIP call via the Triby app. But that's impossible to use for making a quick one-button call to a contact who is not already using the Triby app and part of your circle or approved group. If there is a way to expand the functionality of the call buttons on the device via the app, I have yet to find it.

Despite all this, I kinda love this thing. And that's because it has one killer feature that sounds pointless on paper, but shines in real life.

The ""doodle"" function on the app takes anything you draw on your phone or tablet, and sends it to the small e-ink screen on the Triby. Even better, when a new message comes in, a little yellow flag pops out from the side. You can push the flag back in, or respond with one of a handful of pre-set emojis by pressing a button on the side of the unit.

Yes, it has an emoji button.

This seems like an overly complex way to send a message, something we have no shortage of tools for. But, here's the kicker -- kids love it.

This ridiculous idea of sending drawings to the e-ink screen on a smart speaker kept my 4-year-old occupied for the better part of a weekend, sending doodles to himself. Then his friends came by, and I had a hallway filled with a half-dozen youngsters sending sketches through the Triby app and watching the little flag pop up, over and over again.

Listen, $200 is a lot for a glorified babysitter, especially when so many other parts of the system don't work all that well. But if you want a no-nonsense opinion of whether a gadget is fun, just ask a 4-year-old.

We'll follow up with a rated review soon, once Triby has a chance to work some of the bugs out of its software."
August Smart Lock, HomeKit-enabled review:|"

Startup August announced back in October 2015 that a second-generation Smart Lock would be heading our way soon. Fast forward to, well, right now and the August Smart Lock 2.0 is finally here for $229 on August's site, Amazon and Best Buy. While this is technically a US-only product because it's ""optimized to work in North America,"" Amazon will ship the Smart Lock internationally -- the price coverts to roughly £150 and AU$315 at the current exchange rate.

Smart locks are a fickle category. Because they're securing your front door, you want something durable and reliable that will actually make your life easier. But that hasn't always been our experience during testing. Some models are hard to install, others have confusing apps or hit-or-miss performance. The next-gen August Smart Lock has none of that nonsense. It looks good, it's reliable, the app is easy to use and this version works with Nest, Logitech Harmony, Comcast's Xfinity Home and Siri. So even if you aren't an iPhone user, I'd still strongly recommend August's Editors' Choice award-winning HomeKit-enabled Smart Lock.

Like August's original Smart Lock, which is available for the reduced price of $199 while supplies last, version 2.0 retrofits to existing deadbolts. Be sure to check out the full list of compatible deadbolts before you buy, but it will typically work with most thumb-latch models from Baldwin, Kwikset, Schlage and other widely available brands.

Overall, the Smart Lock's aesthetic doesn't deviate much from the original model. It's available in either a silver or a dark gray finish, with both copper and red finishes planned for future release. And, at 3.39 inches tall by 3.39 inches wide, with a depth of 2.22 inches (8.6cm round by 5.6cm deep), it's larger than a standard doorknob, but unobtrusive nonetheless.

You won't notice any major design updates, but August did smarten up its configuration to make the physical hardware easier to interact with. A new easy-grip pattern and rounded edges improve the ergonomics of manually locking and unlocking the Smart Lock. The team also added magnets and a tweaked design to better secure the faceplate which hides the four included AA batteries. The plate on the original model tended to slip off when you turned the lock. (Battery life will vary a lot depending on usage, but August says it should last about 6 to 9 months.)

Beyond ease of use, the Smart Lock also looks slick and feels durable -- especially compared to a similar design like the Poly-Control Danalock. It's a little tougher to compare style when you venture over to models like the Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt, which require a full replacement of your existing deadbolt. Even so, the second-gen August Smart Lock holds its own as a clean-looking piece of hardware on your front door.

August's design is also discrete since you install it on the inside of your door. Since you keep your old deadbolt in place, your original keyhole and house keys will still work the same way. And everything will look exactly the same from the exterior of your house -- a plus if you want a smart lock, but don't want people to know you have a smart lock.

It's extremely easy to install the August Smart Lock. If you're someone who's interested in do-it-yourself smart home projects, but is new to DIY in general, this would be a great place to start. Assuming your deadbolt is compatible, you should only need a screwdriver (I needed a Phillips-head, but I supposed this could vary depending on your deadbolt) and about 10 to 15 spare minutes to swap out your old lock.

Here are the steps:

1. Make sure your deadbolt is compatible. Again, check this compatibility chart to make sure your hardware will play well with August.

2. Remove the thumb-latch on your old lock. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws on your existing thumb-latch; remove the thumb-latch.

3. Attach the August mounting plate to your deadbolt. Line up the mounting plate August provides with the tail piece of your deadbolt (that's the bit of hardware sticking out that rotates your deadbolt open and closed) and use the screws from your old lock to secure the mounting plate to the door.

4. Attach the adapter to the back of the lock and lift the wing latches. Select the adapter that's compatible with your tail piece, attach it to the back of the lock and lift up the wing latches on the lock. (August provides three adapters; I used the green one because it works with my Kwikset deadbolt, but you can figure out which adapter is best for your deadbolt in August's detailed installation guide.)

5. Connect the lock to the mounting plate and flip down the wing latches. Fit the lock over the mounting plate on your door (you'll feel it snap into place) and close the wing latches to secure it in place.

That's it, you're done. Again, it feels a little unfair to compare this setup to models that require a full deadbolt replacement. Even so, this lock is by far the easiest to install out of all the models we've reviewed so far.

After you've successfully installed the Smart Lock, remove the magnetic faceplate and throw away the plastic battery separator tab so it can enter pairing mode. August is a Bluetooth lock, which means that you can only control it via its app when you and your phone are within roughly 30 feet (10m) of it (there are exceptions if you add compatible accessories, which we'll discuss later on).

Download the Android or iPhone August app, create an account and select the ""Set up lock"" option. From there, the app will scan for and find your lock, and you simply have to name the lock (I named mine ""Front Door""), add a house name (in our case, ""CNET's House"") and it should connect.

Then, you'll be instructed to ""calibrate"" your lock, which just means you need to open and close it one time each manually so August can learn how much the motor needs to work and how far it needs to turn to lock and unlock. That's it for setup if you're only using August's basic Bluetooth functions and nothing more.

For some, this functionality will be more than enough. It means that you can lock and unlock your door from the app when you're within Bluetooth range, send virtual keys to friends, family members and anyone else you'd like to grant either permanent or temporary access to your house. It also means that you can opt-in to the automatic locking and unlocking geofencing features that, as the names suggests, will lock and unlock your door for you based on your (and your phone's) comings and goings.

To opt-in to geofencing, select Auto-unlock in the settings section of the app. Toggle the switch over to enable the feature. If your phone's location services are switched on, the geofencing map should automatically adjust to your current location. You can also customize the detection perimeter to any distance from 100 to 5,000 meters.

Unlike the auto-unlock feature, auto-lock is timer-based. That means the Smart Lock will automatically lock the door anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes after you unlock the door. Just specify your preferred time frame in the app and you're set.

Auto-lock features were available with the original Smart Lock and worked quite well, and they continued to work well (if not better) this time around. They were both responsive and worked consistently. While it's easy to see the value of hands-free access to your front door, it's also worth noting that geofencing performance can vary user-to-user by location and even by phone carrier. Here are August's troubleshooting tips if you run into any issues.

There's a bit more to this story, though. August also sells a $79 Connect accessory (about £55 or AU$105, converted) that gives your Smart Lock Wi-Fi smarts for true remote access from anywhere you can get your phone online. In addition, an August spokesperson confirmed that the all-new $199 August Doorbell Cam (converted, £135 or AU$260) can also act as a Wi-Fi bridge for the lock. If you're interested in August's doorbell and its lock, you won't need the separate Connect accessory for remote integration via Wi-Fi. These are excellent add-ons if you're looking for longer-range remote control, but don't care about Apple's Siri-based smart home platform.

That brings me to HomeKit. Apple's HomeKit smart home platform gives select connected home products access to Siri so you can control devices straight from your phone using your voice. August's second-gen Smart Lock is one such device. Similar to the HomeKit-enabled Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt, you can ask Siri to ""Unlock/lock the Front Door,"" and even assign a room name so you can simply say, ""Unlock the living room door.""

This requires additional configuration from the August app, including scanning an eight-digit code inside the Smart Lock's faceplate, naming your lock and naming the room. This part of the HomeKit setup is seamless, as it's integrated directly into August's software and the steps are easy to follow. But this only allows for local Siri control, meaning within range of your local Wi-Fi network.

If you want to use Siri to control your August Lock when you're away from home, things get slightly more complex. Currently, you need a fourth-generation Apple TV to act as the Wi-Fi/security bridge connecting your phone and Siri to your lock. Theoretically you only need to be logged in to the same iCloud account and have the Keychain function turned on in your phone's settings.

Unfortunately, because there isn't a dedicated HomeKit app or other sort of built-in software tutorial for figuring out remote Siri access via your Apple TV, getting it to work takes maneuvering. Troubleshooting suggestions from both Apple and August include tips such as restarting your phone; logging out of and back in to your iCloud account on Apple TV; and making sure the software is up-to-date on both devices. It isn't exactly difficult to see if your phone has the latest software, but it can be time-consuming to test out various scenarios before finding the culprit.

It can make the overall experience a little trying, but he potential frustration might be worth it if you have a new Apple TV handy and want remote Siri access. Once I got it to work, it was very reliable. August's second-gen Smart Lock also integrates with iDevices, Insteon+ and Lutron HomeKit apps if you happen to have multiple HomeKit devices.

While this lock doesn't integrate with Samsung's SmartThings or Wink, it does work with Logitech Harmony and Comcast's Xfinity Home. It's also a Works with Nest partner. That means you should be able to program your Nest Learning Thermostat to switch to either Home or Away mode when you unlock or lock your door and see the current temperature in your home from the August app. You should also be able to see activity-based video clips the Nest Cam records from the August app.

All of that's to say that you have a lot of options in terms of how you connect to the second-generation August Smart Lock and how you might integrate it into your wider smart-home setup. The Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt is one of August's closest competitors due to its HomeKit integration, but you only get remote access with that product if you buy the Apple TV. August, on the other hand, has the Connect accessory and the Doorbell Cam that can also perform that function.

In addition, a lot of Schlage and Yale locks require third-party hubs to work and don't come with dedicated apps as a result. The Schlage Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt, for example, doesn't have a software component. Instead, you have to use the SmartThings app as your access point for installation, set up and general use. That's great if you like SmartThings, but it can also be limiting if your smart-home hub of choice happens to go kaput.

Even with the clunky remote Siri setup, the second-gen August Smart Lock is excellent, and deserving of a CNET Editors' Choice award. From the easy installation to interacting with the app and the hardware itself, the entire process was straightforward, simple and, best of all, worked very reliably. Given the number of Smart Lock accessories available and the option of adding Siri into the mix via HomeKit, I can easily recommend this lock as a truly smart addition to your front door."
Klug Home will turn your router into a smart home hub|"

Making a connected household is one thing, but getting all the devices in your home talking to each other in a meaningful way is where the smart home ideal often breaks down. The challenge only grows once you throw in industry competition and a patchwork of company partnerships. But a small device, seeking funding through Indiegogo and developed by Singapore startup Intraix, claims it has a solution.

Klug Home looks like a small USB drive, but instead of plugging into your laptop or TV, it connects to your Wi-Fi router. From there it coordinates all sorts of devices, from wearables to smart home tech. And the kicker is, when it lands in October, it will integrate Google's Nest, Amazon's Echo, Apple's HomeKit, and a bunch of gadgets besides -- all for the low price of $109 (roughly £75 or AU$140). If it works, it could be a must-buy dongle for smart home aficionados. Of course, as usual with crowd-funded tech, that's a big if.

Klug Home (pronounced ""kloog,"" from the German word for ""smart"") is notable for a few reasons. First off, it cleverly turns your router into a smart home hub, like SmartThings or Lowe's Iris. Hubs translate the low-energy communication protocols of smart home devices into a language your phone can understand, and vice versa. While Klug Home certainly can't speak every language, it does work with Zigbee -- one of the most common protocols.

Intraix hopes to do more than provide another hub and app, though. Klug Home will learn patterns of use over time to see how individual devices are activated in the context of other devices. Although Intraix shared few details about the learning algorithm they plan to employ, Klug Home is clearly meant to be a lifestyle smart home integration device, not simply another gadget that coordinates your recipes from the Web service If This Then That (IFTTT).

Between its Wi-Fi and Zigbee communication, Klug Home could compete with other smart hubs. What sets it apart, though, is which major platforms it will integrate. Intraix says Klug will work with HomeKit, Amazon Echo, Nest and IFTTT, among others.

Unifying those platforms could mean making adjustments to your Nest Thermostat with Siri, or getting a Zigbee flood sensor to alert you through Echo. Klug would be the first to bridge the gap between some of these large platforms, and that potential is huge.

Such ambitious claims pique my skepticism as much as my interest. For devices to work with the HomeKit platform, they must receive hardware certification from Apple. Intraix plans to bypass this requirement by connecting the Klug Home app to other HomeKit devices, rather than connecting the devices directly. Whether this will affect latency or reliability remains to be seen, especially since third-party HomeKit apps have been such a mixed bag.

In addition, Klug Home doesn't work with Bluetooth devices, which make up a large number of smart home gadgets -- connected locks in particular. For a device attempting to unify the smart home, this is a major hole.

Intraix's vision of seamless integration despite industry divides is exciting. It's cool to imagine my Fitbit or phone telling my vents and thermostat that I'm 5 minutes from home after a morning run. An integration system that learns your preferences as you live in your home -- that's a dream scenario for anyone who's spent hours trying to make two devices play nice. I'll believe it when I see it."
Stack's new smart bulb detects motion even through lampshades|"

It's been a little over a year since Stack Lighting debuted its app-enabled, Nest-thermostat-compatible LED floodlights. Now, at the Lightfair 2016 lighting industry convention in San Diego, the California-based manufacturer is opening up preorders for a new smart bulb called the Stack Classic LED. During the preorder period, you'll be able to pick up a two-bulbs-and-a-hub starter pack for $89, with additional bulbs costing $28.

Built to replace the common A-shaped bulb, the Stack Classic LED offers the same integrations with Nest as Stack's original BR30 smart bulbs, and it uses the same ZigBee radio to communicate with the same plug-in hub. Sync that hub with the Stack app, and you'll be able to control the new bulbs alongside Stack's old ones right from your phone.

Aside from tapping the things on and off, dimming them up and down, and tuning the color temperature from warm tones to hot ones, those controls include timed lighting changes and automation settings. Thanks to the ambient light sensors built into each bulb, you can set them to automatically dim up and down as light levels change throughout the day.

Like the original Stack floodlights, the new Stack Classic LEDs will also track you as you come and go, using built-in motion detectors. However, unlike the original bulbs, the new Stack LEDs use tomographic sensors that are based on disturbances in transmitted radio frequencies (RF). Stack claims that this approach allows the lights to detect motion with greater precision -- even when the bulb is hidden behind a sconce or lampshade.

Stack also has plans to license that RF technology out to third parties through a ""Stack Enabled"" program. The only names on board so far are Lunera, Brilia and Plumen, a company that makes fancy-looking designer fixtures out of fluorescent light bulbs. Expect to see smart, Stack Enabled versions of those bulbs at some point in the future.

In addition to Nest, Stack's smart bulbs work with the online automation service IFTTT, which seems like a handy way of putting those motion-detecting smarts to use. A Stack Lighting representative tells me that the brand plans on adding voice controls in the future by way of Apple HomeKit and Amazon's Alexa, though there isn't a timetable for when that might happen.

As for the bulbs themselves, Stack expects preorders to start shipping by September 2016."
Kuna Light Fixture review:|"

The $199 Kuna Light Fixture has a secret. From a distance it looks like a plain ol' mild-mannered porch light. But when you get closer, you can see that it's actually equipped with a security camera -- and an impressive one at that, including 720p high-definition live video, motion detection, two-way talk, an on-demand siren and optional cloud recording beginning at $60 per year.

Since this DIY device is also a functional outdoor fixture (you do have to buy your own bulbs, though), you have access to advanced light control options that work in tandem with the security camera -- all accessible via the straightforward Kuna Android and iPhone app. The downside? There's no night vision or third-party integration and Kuna only has a 2-hour free storage ""grace period"" for video recordings, versus the minimum of 24 free hours most competitors offer.

Even so, the Kuna light-camera hybrid is a product I can comfortably recommend to anyone interested in something discreet that's rated for the outdoors and connects seamlessly to your old wall-mounted porch light's wires for steady, continuous battery-free power (it won't work with ceiling-mounted entry lights).

The Kuna is an interesting concept, one that got its start on Indiegogo back in 2014 and raised a grand total of $229,373 -- well over its original $50,000 goal. Now it's available for sale in the US on  	Amazon, as well as on Kuna's online store. Note: The Maximus Smart Security Wall Lantern available at Home Depot and elsewhere is the same product and uses the same Kuna app.

If you don't fancy the craftsman style of the Kuna we tested, don't worry. There are also traditional and contemporary designs available. Craftsman and traditional models come in either a black or a bronze finish, while the contemporary style is available in a black finish only.

Our craftsman-esque review unit is the heaviest of the three Kuna styles at 3.1 pounds, and it measures 11 inches tall by 6 inches wide with a depth of 8.5 inches. I like its heft and size, though, as it feels durable enough to withstand the elements and is a welcome design upgrade to the tarnished brass fixture that was installed there before.

A Kuna should be able to replace most existing wall-mounted porch lights with standard 120V-AC, 60Hz circuits and it took me roughly 20 minutes from start to finish to set mine up, with a little help. Here's an overview of the steps:

Still have questions? Check out  	Kuna's detailed installation guide.

If you installed everything correctly, the Kuna should start flashing a blue LED status light almost immediately. Download the Kuna app on your Android or iOS device and follow the instructions to add the camera for remote access on your phone.

This process is very straightforward, as Kuna's software automatically starts searching for the camera when the blue LED begins to blink. From there, you simply plug in your local Wi-Fi network's details and that's that. You're ready to start customizing your alerts, light settings, cloud recording subscription (optional) and more.

Turn off power to the light you're replacing. Uninstall your existing porch light from the junction box -- you should have three wires: a power wire, a return wire and a ground wire. If you don't already have a comparable mounting bracket installed in your junction box, here's where you'd add it. (Since our junction box already had one, we skipped this step.) Connect the Kuna's wires to the ones in the junction box using wire nuts (this was the hardest part for me, as it was challenging to hold the light in one hand and connect the wires with the other -- here's where I enlisted a friend to help). Secure the Kuna to the mounting bracket and turn the power back on -- voila! You're done.

I opted to receive a push notification every time someone triggered the motion detector and I scheduled the porch light to automatically turn on at dusk and off again at dawn. You can also program it to turn on any time the motion sensor detects activity.

The Kuna system didn't disappoint, dishing out prompt push alerts whenever someone crossed within the roughly 10-foot motion threshold (occasionally it detected motion beyond this range, closer to 15-30 feet away), pulling up a clear HD video stream (minus some occasional dips in performance due to bandwidth limitations -- something to consider if your Wi-Fi is regularly hit-or-miss), recording clips that captured an entire motion event and returning clear audio when using the two-way talk intercom function.

This smart security device is also outfitted with a 100-decibel siren that you can activate from the app to scare people away. 100 decibels isn't  loud loud, especially with the addition of ambient outside noise, but the blaring tone of this siren is especially off-putting and will easily startle someone that's lurking around your house. You can also play one of the prerecorded messages loaded in the app. They include, ""I'm busy right now,"" ""Can I help you?"" and ""Sorry, not interested"" -- all easy to execute from the app while you're watching the live feed.

Note: If you have multiple porch lights, but don't want or need multiple camera-connected Kunas, the team also sells camera-free versions for $129 with the same advanced light control capabilities via the app.

Like  Nest Cam and other subscription-based cloud cameras, Kuna extends temporary free access to its premium storage service so you can check out the features. After that 14-day period, you'll have to sign up to receive the full benefits. These begin at $60 a year for 7 days of saved clips for one Kuna, up to $240 a year for up to 30 days of saved clips for as many as eight Kunas.

Kuna does give a free 2-hour grace period of sorts for reviewing saved clips. I suppose that technically qualifies as free cloud storage, but it's much more limited than the  Icontrol Piper's 1,000 free clips or Homeboy's free 30-day rolling cloud storage. Still, it does offer something if you like Kuna's product but don't want to pay the cloud storage fee.

Also, while I was impressed with the Kuna system's performance and overall ease of use, this discreet, design-centric device doesn't have night vision. Instead, you're supposed to rely on the light bulb in the fixture to provide enough  lumens when it's dark out, but that isn't nearly as good as night-vision-specific infrared LEDs. Of course, some of that will depend on the light bulb you buy. Kuna's online FAQ says its Light Fixture will work with incandescents, CFLs or LEDs, but noted that its ""tests show the best results from a standard A-15 LED or CFL light bulb, 450 lumen.""

It also doesn't offer  an IFTTT channel, compatibility with Amazon's voice control assistant Alexa or broader integration with any products from other manufacturers. That's a significant disadvantage if you're looking for stuff that fits into your existing smart-home setup.

Even so, I really like the Kuna and there's nothing else quite like it on the market today -- the closest probably being motion-sensor-equipped  smart doorbells like the Ring or August. One obvious advantage of a Kuna is that it's less noticeable. It's also less prone to theft since the majority of porch lights are installed above doorways rather than at or below eye level.

Overall, the Kuna is a clever connected product that's worth consideration, particularly if you're in the market for an outdoor camera that's similar to a  smart doorbell but significantly more discreet."
Iris by Lowe's Second Generation review:|"

On paper, Iris by Lowe's handled the transition from the first to the second generation of the company's smart home system well. Iris took note of the problems with generation one, and promised faster response time, easier device pairing, and more robust app controls. The company even offered existing customers a free upgrade to the $60 next-gen hub along with a migration tool to help with the transition.

Take a look at the comments in the iOS app store, in Google's Play store, or even on the new hub's page on Lowe's site (at the bottom of this page, too) and you'll notice lots of customers unhappy with the upgrade. The migration tool wasn't ready at launch, and the second-gen system wasn't fully compatible with all first gen devices. Lots of customization options were lost in translation. Many of these details have been added back in through updates since the second-gen launched in November, but customers who relied on a web interface instead of the app to interact with the system are still out of luck. Rightly, they're pissed.

Transition issues aside, Lowe's Iris generation two doesn't hold up on its own merits as a good smart-home system. It is more responsive, but using the app is tedious and counterintuitive. Some pieces of hardware don't work consistently. Worse, you still have to pay a $10 monthly fee just to use some of the basic features of the system. Wink, SmartThings and Insteon all have similar features for free, and all are a better buy than the second generation Lowe's Iris system right now.

For the review process, I primarily looked at the devices contained with the $130 Iris Automation Pack -- the hub, two contact sensors to detect when a door opens and closes, a smart outlet you can use to automate a lamp or anything else with a plug, a button you can map to rules or use as a panic button, and a motion sensor.

The $60 hub has antennas for ZigBee, Z-Wave and Bluetooth wireless radios -- covering the bases for typical smart-home connection standards. In theory, Iris should be widely compatible with third party devices. You plug it into your router so you can control your devices from anywhere over Wi-Fi. And it uses four AA batteries as a backup in case power goes down -- Lowe's has on optional cellular backup plan for $5 a month so you can access the system even when your router is offline.

Other first party Lowe's devices include a garage door controller, a range extender, an indoor and outdoor camera, a keypad and a water sensor. The hub works with third party devices like GE plugs, First Alert smoke detectors, Honeywell thermostats, Osram lights and locks from Schlage, Yale, and Kwikset. In all, it's a lineup competitive with SmartThings, Wink, and Insteon. Though Wink and SmartThings get lots of additional interoperability via integration with IFTTT -- the online rule maker. Iris doesn't have that.

You can buy the Lowe's Iris hub, the Automation Pack, the $100 Security starter pack, and any other Lowe's Iris accessory, as well as a number of compatible third party devices  now from Lowes.com and in Lowe's retail outlets.

Lowe's Iris only officially supports the US, but according to the company, does have customers using the system overseas. The price of the hub converts to approximately £40 and AU$80 for our readers in the UK and Australia respectively. The $130 Automation Pack converts to £90 and AU$170. The $100 Security pack costs roughly £70 and AU$130.

With the first generation, we were annoyed by how little you could do with the app. For the most part, you needed to control the system with the Web interface. That isn't a problem anymore. Anything you control with Lowe's Iris, you control via the app. In fact, now the Web interface is bare-bones. You can use it to manage your billing, though Iris Vice President Mick Koster promised that core services are coming back to the web later this year.

Between rules, schedules, scenes, and managing alerts and alarms, you can do a lot with the app to make your Lowe's Iris smart home pretty smart. For instance, the hub comes with a built-in alarm, and you can set up your motion sensor or contact sensor to trigger the alarm and send you a push notification when the system is armed. Unfortunately, a lot of this functionality sits behind a paywall. By comparison, with SmartThings, you can use IFTTT to create a wide variety of recipes using a large catalog of interoperable devices and platforms for free. To do something similar, even with first-party Lowe's Iris accessories, you need to pay $10 a month. Here's the breakdown of what's free and what's not in the app on IrisbyLowes.com.

That could all change in the coming months. Lowe's Iris will offer contract free monitoring as an optional add-on soon. At that point, a $20 monthly fee will include professional monitoring and the premium version of the app, plus cellular backup of the hub. That price feels much more worth it, given that monitoring alone costs $25 a month with SimpliSafe. AT&T's Digital Life charges as much as $65 a month for monitoring.

Plus, once monitoring becomes a reality for Lowe's, Koster assured me the company would start looking at the basic to premium breakdown, and moving some premium features to the other side of the paywall. But I can't give any credit now to a smart-home system based on how good it might be in a couple of months. As it stands, that $10 monthly fee is dumb.

"" data-image-credit=""Screenshots by Andrew Gebhart/CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""screen-shot-2016-04-15-at-11-10-27-am.png"" data-image-credit-url="""" data-image-target-url="""" data-image-title=""Screen Shot 2016-04-15 at 11.10.27 AM"" data-image-filename=""screen-shot-2016-04-15-at-11-10-27-am.png"" data-image-date-created=""2016/04/15"" data-image-crop="""" data-image-crop-gravity="""" data-image-aspect-ratio="""" data-image-height=""493"" data-image-width=""857"" data-image-do-not-crop="""" data-image-do-not-resize="""" data-image-watermark=""1"" data-lightbox=""enabled"" data-parallax="""">

Even the full version of the app -- which is what I used to test Iris by Lowe's -- isn't great. For one thing, multiple users can't access the same smart home system with their own log-ins. As you might expect, that upgrade is coming. Right now, the most you can do is assign PIN codes to a secondary user for locks and alarms, and allow that person to receive push notifications.

The dashboard for the primary user shows every category of device Lowe's Iris offers, whether you have something in that category or not. It even lists categories of devices that are still ""coming soon."" And there's no way to simplify or reorganize the main page of the app, so it feels more like a giant ad trying to get you to buy more Iris gear than a page designed to actually help you understand and control your home. You can change the picture at the top of the page, and a menu of buttons underneath that by selecting favorites, but that's it.

And you'll see the dashboard a lot, as navigating from one subsection to another requires you go back to the dashboard first. The dashboard itself has a menu button in the top left corner letting you jump to your devices, rules or scenes page. But for some reason, that button disappears once you select your submenu. None of those pages even have a button to immediately get back to the dashboard. You also can't add a new rule or device from their respective pages. Again, you have to go back to the dashboard, and click on the plus button in the upper right-hand corner.

Fortunately, adding devices is easy and quick. The app walks you through the process each time and even includes a video tutorial you can click on during the setup if you need more help.

Adding rules isn't as intuitive. You can't just create one from scratch as you do with IFTTT. You need to find the category of the device you want the rule for, then select your rule from a list. Scrolling through prebaked rules for your devices is nice in that it could help you come up with ideas for what exactly to do with your smart home, but you'll also see a bunch of rules you can't activate yet until you buy more Lowe's Iris hardware.

Once I figured out the app and had a few devices up and running, I had a mostly smooth time using Lowe's Iris. In addition to the Automation Pack, I synced the system to our Schlage Century deadbolt we previously had installed on SmartThings. Getting it to forget SmartThings and work with Lowe's was a pain, but I'm not sure that's something I can blame on Lowe's.

After the deadbolt connected to the hub, I had full functionality of it, and even an extra function I wasn't expecting -- using the Lowe's Iris app, I could buzz somebody in. So instead of just using the app to lock and unlock the door, if the door is locked, you can hit the ""buzz in"" button. The door will unlock then lock again a few moments later. I was pleased to see the Iris system not only working well with third-party devices, but being creative with the functionality.

I never noticed any lag over the couple of weeks I tested Iris, but several of the devices didn't stay consistently connected. For one thing, the smart button would only do what it was supposed to about 90 percent of the time. That seems like a lot, but if you use it as a panic button, you'd want to know for sure that the alarm would sound when you press it.

Also, the contact sensor I placed on the closet door -- only a room away from the hub -- lost connection during the course of testing. The button did too once, but it came back online after I pressed it a few times. The contact sensor didn't come back until I took the battery out and put it back in.

For the most part, the Iris by Lowe's system performed adequately if you're using the devices for convenience, but not so reliably that I'd recommend using the devices for security.

Professional monitoring, better multiuser integration and more free app functionality are all supposedly coming to the Iris by Lowe's Second Generation system in a matter of months. At that point, this could be a good smart-home system, but it isn't one right now. All of this potential, and all of these promises, along with the many angry commenters who felt spurned by the upgrade, make me think the second generation of the Lowe's Iris system hit retailers before it was done cooking.

To make this system worth it, you'd need to invest in devices, pay a monthly fee for the app, spend a lot of time setting up rules and schedules, and have the patience to resync devices whenever they lose their connection. You'd be doing all of that while gambling that Lowe's Iris gets the upgrades it needs without undoing any of your progress, and given how the last major upgrade went, that doesn't feel like a smart bet. If you like the potential of Lowe's Iris, I recommend leaving it on store shelves for now to make sure you don't get left behind when it does come to fruition. Otherwise, I recommend investing in a different smart-home system, such as Wink or SmartThings."
D-Link DKZ-201S review:|"

We haven't had a whole lot of luck with D-Link's smart-home products in the past. Its first-gen Wi-Fi Smart Plug was extremely difficult to set up and use and its Pan and Tilt Day/Night Network Camera didn't really work at all. Things shifted slightly in D-Link's favor with its comically ginormous, but mostly functional Full HD 180-Degree Wi-Fi Camera.

But its latest product, the $250 Komfy Switch with Camera (model number DKZ-201S) is something I can comfortably recommend. Believe me, I'm a little surprised too.

Overall, the Komfy works well and offers all sorts of features for your money:

The downside, of course, is that you'd have to shell out 250 bucks (it's available for $210 on Amazon right now) for a light switch when you could spend just $200 on a Nest Cam or some other 1080p live streaming camera with more mobility. D-Link's Komfy is also limited to iPhones, automatically rendering this product useless to Android users.

At the same time, the Komfy is comparatively more discreet -- way more discreet than the brand's own massive 1080p camera -- and packs in extra functionality when you consider all of the included environment sensors.

It looks nice, too. The Komfy Switch has simple black or white plastic face- and wall- plates that snap on easily after installation. Installation is a bit trickier, though. That's mainly because it involves electrical wiring and if you aren't comfortable in that realm, you should absolutely check with an experienced friend or hire a professional to handle this part. The Komfy is also larger than your standard switch and might not fit in the electrical cutout as easily as your previous model.

The video below is a tutorial for installing a similar product, the Belkin WeMo Switch. It will give you the gist of what's involved, but is slightly different than the Komfy install, especially if you're connecting two switches. Just make sure you switch the lights, fan or other device off at the circuit breaker before starting any electrical project.

1- or 2-gang light control (that's up to two lights on the same switch plate)Auto-on/off scheduling1080p live streamingOptional fee-based cloud storage, a microSD card slot (up to 64GB)Motion and sound detectionAmbient temperature, humidity, light and air quality readings, energy consumption statsA related IFTTT channel  (but no other smart home product or platform support)

Here are the basics of using D-Link's Komfy: it can control up to two light switches on a shared plate, also known as 2-gang -- press the top of the faceplate (above the camera) to manually control the first light and the bottom section of the faceplate (under the camera) to control the other light. It doesn't work with dimmers and it doesn't work with lights that have more than one control switch. In other words, if there are two separate switches on either side of your living room that both control the same light(s), you can't use them for this installation.

That could/will very likely limit where you put this product. So make sure to check on the types of switches you have before your purchase to ensure that you can actually install the Komfy in a place that makes sense to have a security camera, particularly where switches are facing vulnerable entry-points like exterior doors.

The iPhone-only Komfy app is very easy to use. You can view a live stream in either day or night vision, watch saved clips (if you opt-in to cloud recording; this feature is in beta for now and available for free, but D-Link will begin to charge for it when it launches its subscription service) and record videos or snap photos on-demand. You can also receive notifications based on motion, sound, humidity, temperature and more, as well as schedule actions, like having your Komfy-connected lights switch on at certain times.

There's also a ""One-Click"" function that's manual rather than schedule-based and allows you to set custom home/away/bedtime/wake up and a ""favorites"" mode. And, I created an IFTTT recipe that automatically switched off the light whenever my phone left a geofenced space surrounding the CNET Smart Home.

Everything worked well (minus some phantom motion alerts), but I was especially impressed with the app. It's extremely intuitive, with an updated, straightforward design that's a breeze to navigate -- something we haven't yet experienced with a D-Link app.

There isn't anything quite like D-Link's $250 Komfy Switch with Camera on the market today. It's definitely a niche product that won't make sense if you don't have a compatible 1- or 2-gang light switch facing a spot in your home that could use a little extra security -- and it might not fit in every electrical cutout. But it works well and offers a lot of unexpected, but useful features. Bonus: you can find it on Amazon right now for $210."
This compact smart home gym should help get you fit (hands-on)|"

I'm the last person you'd expect to find in a gym, but if Move It has its way, I'll be turning into a gym rat in the comfort of my home. The company's eponymous debut product, the Move It smart home gym, is a set of training equipment and a pair of smart sensors that connect to your mobile phone. The gear makes an elegant package that wouldn't be out of place in an upscale modern home.

Costing $229 (around £160 or AU$300), the Move It is currently available for pre-order via crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. It was designed by a bunch of Hong Kong Canadians with impressive pedigrees from the IT industry. The CEO, Ivan Ho, formerly worked for Microsoft and Chinese social network YY.com, while co-founder Oscar Wang has ties to the health industry.

The four workout tools included in the Move It are a resistance band, an ab wheel, a jump rope and a pushup stand. While these are the most basic of fitness gear, the real smarts lie in a pair of handles that connect to the exercise gear. They have sensors such as a six-axis accelerometer, a gyroscope, a capacitive sensor, a pressure grip sensor and infrared for measuring distance. When you connect the handles to the gear, it automatically detects the form of exercise you'll be doing and sends the data to the app on your phone. When not in use, all four tools as well as the handle are stored away neatly on the stand.

Based on my quick hands-on with the tools, Move It seemed pretty accurate, and through the app, you can select workout regimes designed by CrossFit trainers, or challenge your friend to a competition to see who can do more push ups. Move It says the real fun is scoring on the leaderboards, though given how lazy I am when it comes to exercising, I'd more than likely to just do the bare minimum just to get my money's worth.

Ho claims the company got a friend who works at a BMW design studio to come up with its industrial looks, and I think this has really paid off. The company's Indiegogo site goes live today, 13 April -- in fact, it's already passed its goal.

Don't sweat it: This smart gym promises an easier workout|"

If you're anything like me, you struggle to find time to hit the gym. Hong-Kong-based startup Eggplant Technologies learned this well when it launched in 2014. Too busy to fit in a workout, the team dreamed up an ""all-in-one"" product with built-in sensors that track your movements and transmit that data to a related Android or iPhone app.

Enter: Move It.

Move It, Eggplant Technologies' inaugural product, launched on Indiegogo today. At first glance, this quirky gizmo conjures up memories of similarly counterintuitive-looking fitness crazes from infomercials-past. HealthRider, Nordic Track, Suzanne Somers' assorted ThighMasters, the list goes on...

But Move It's confusing compact design is actually modular, breaking apart into the different components pictured below -- an ab wheel, a resistance band, two push-up bars and a jump rope.

In addition to its four main parts, Move It also boasts battery-powered ""interchangeable intelligent handles and sensors"" that are supposed to send all of the details from your workout straight to the companion app. Not only is this app connectivity designed to motivate you with activity stats, how many calories you burned and tips on your overall form, it also houses an LED indicator that shows how much charge is left and more.

If having the app track your fitness isn't enough, you can also access live and prerecorded gym sessions and interact with other users (Eggplant Technologies calls them ""workout buddies"") through their profiles.

I'm not convinced that this contraption would make me any more likely to work out at home, but it does reveal a growing fitness-smart-home trend that goes beyond activity trackers to integrating app-enabled gym products into your home and your daily life. Prices for Move It start at $159 for the earliest backers and the team has a $30,000 funding goal. Find out more on Move It's Indiegogo campaign page."
Synek's wine device Somm goes live on Kickstarter|"

Drinking wine is really fun. In fact, going to Napa Valley to visit wineries and taste expensive wines is one of my favorite trips. But the drinking-to-learning ratio's got to be right. That's why you don't see many people sitting on couches, reading a book on varietals without a glass of pinot in hand to help the information go down more easily.

Here's where smart home tech comes in: Ideally, a smart wine device lets you drink wine, learn about that wine and feel cool all at the same time. I've tested one wine device before and had mixed feelings about it, but the potential is definitely there. And now Synek, the company behind the Counter Top Beer Dispenser, is taking on the project.

With its newly launched Kickstarter campaign, Synek hopes to fund a device called Somm (short for sommelier, a professional wine expert). Essentially Somm will house wine, keep it at ideal temperatures, limit aeration to prevent degradation and, finally, educate users through the companion app. It's a cool concept, and it could be worth the $199 (about £140 or AU$260) pre-order price or $299 (£210 or AU$395) final price -- if it works.

Synek's Somm is a large, freestanding, counter top device. The cartridges that fit into it are much larger than typical bottles of wine. Instead, each cartridge -- called a Sylo -- holds about three bottles' worth. A small chip on the Sylo tells Somm what temperature to keep the wine at and how aerated the wine should be before drinking. When the wine is ready to be poured, a diastolic pump pulls the wine out of a collapsible membrane, aerates it appropriately, and pours the glass.

The mechanism should stop air from contacting the wine in the Sylo, meaning it won't degrade even after you pour a glass. Of course, the Kuvée Bottle was supposed to do that too, but was unsuccessful. Wine is delicate, and oxygen is its enemy. So for now, I'm skeptical of Synek's approach, though hopeful in what its execution could mean for the lifespan of wine.

The educational side of Somm comes through the app. Using Synek's app, Somm will tell you about the wine you're drinking, and it will help you order more. I like the idea, but I wonder if it will be significantly more informative than a quick Google search. And ordering Sylos through Synek will only really seem appealing if it entails discounts.

The mechanics of Sylos could work well. I hope they do! But part of me -- maybe the purist I try to resist -- feels the experience of wine might be diminished if it comes from a dispenser. You won't get Sylos from Synek to display next to bottles. You won't get it for a date night. Somm feels more like a cool party device. And that's where I think its value will be. Getting larger amounts of wine for discounted prices would work well when you're entertaining. And Synek says both old and new world wines will be represented -- a good sign for serving varied tastes.

Synek's Somm looks like an interesting concept with typical pros and cons. But if it gets funded, if development goes well (which is not always guaranteed in crowd-funded endeavors) and, ultimately, if it works, then it could be a solid purchase."
Wazombi Smart Shades review:|"

Wazombi's Smart Shades are a simple product. The body of the device sticks to the wall beside your window, you feed the line from your shade into the wheel of the device, and it turns to crank your shade open or closed. The device alone costs $80 (about £56 or AU$104), but another $20 (£14 or AU$26) will buy a solar panel to power it -- as opposed to the included Mini-USB charger. A free iOS- and Android-compatible app sets schedules and, in the near future, automations.

Right now, Wazombi's device has some serious limitations -- in particular a reliance on continuous-loop, beaded chain shades. The base technology is inelegant. But it's also clever, and has potential. Wazombi is aware of many of the limitations it has, and plans fixes for most of them over the next few months. Though I would pass on the product right now, Smart Shades is worth keeping an eye on as it develops.

The design of Wazombi's Smart Shades is simple, but that simplicity introduces three problems:

Wazombi plans to fix the first two issues within the next three months -- the first with affordable wheels personalized for different shade-types, the second with an adjustable turn speed. When those changes come, the device will be much improved.

Other exciting possibilities for Wazombi will come with further updates. The ability to automate shades based on the intensity of the sunlight entering the window -- as measured by the solar panel -- will be a big addition. And it should be active through a firmware update within the next few months.

After working with Smart Shades for a couple days, though, it seems like a clever product that lacks polish and flexibility. Hopefully, those will come as more features develop. But for now, unless you have continuous-loop, beaded-chain shades, I recommend waiting.

The device only works with hard-to-find and often-expensive continuous-loop, beaded-chain shades. If you don't have these already, Wazombi's gadget isn't worth it.The wheel only turns so quickly, so opening or closing a shade can take from 2 to 4 minutes, depending on the weight of the shade. Though that isn't much of an issue for automation, it makes remote control annoying and inconvenient.The price is higher than $90 competitor FlipFlic, which includes a solar panel (out next January)."
Amazon Tap review:|"

The Amazon Tap is growing up, and hitting its stride as the portable Alexa device we'd hoped it could become.

After we gave it a lukewarm review last year, the $130 Amazon Tap -- the battery-powered, portable member of the Alexa family -- had sunk to the level of an afterthought in the CNET Smart Home. Unlike Amazon's other devices with the digital assistant Alexa built-in -- the $180 Echo and the $50 Echo Dot -- the Tap wasn't always listening. You had to literally tap the Tap to give it a command.

Though hitting a button to talk to a device might not seem like a huge inconvenience, it made the Tap less useful for controlling the smart home. And it completely obviated the main reason why people buy an Alexa device to begin with: you speak into the air, and it just hears you.

But now that problem is history. Thanks to a free over-the-air upgrade, the Amazon Tap now supports a ""hands-free"" mode. With the mode activated (you can toggle it in the app), the Tap responds to the wake word ""Alexa"" just like the Echo and the Dot. With that update in place, the Tap is everything we'd hoped a portable Alexa could be.

The Tap is still not perfect. In fact, as a Bluetooth speaker, similarly priced rivals such as the UE Boom 2, Bose SoundLink Color 2 and JBL Flip 3 (soon to be replaced by the Flip 4) best it as far as sound quality goes. And engaging the always-on listening mode cuts down battery life just a tad. Thanks to Alexa, though, the Tap is miles ahead of those devices in terms of multitasking. In addition to playing music, Amazon's assistant will set reminders, search the internet, play games, tell a joke, control your smart home or perform any number of an ever-growing list of functions.

Now that the Tap supports an always-listening mode, I'm happy to recommend it to anyone who wants Alexa's capabilities in a compact form that you can bring with you as you roam.

You can purchase the Tap now on Amazon for $130. Unlike the Echo and the Dot, the Tap is only available in the US for now. That price converts to roughly £100 and AU$170.

Editors' note, February 28, 2017: Earlier this month, Amazon announced a free over-the-air upgrade to the Tap allowing you to enable an always-listening mode. This feature fixed one of our main criticisms of the device. Now that we've tested this new functionality, the review (originally published April 2, 2016) has been updated accordingly, and a new video added.

Obviously, nothing about the physical device has changed since the over-the-air update. The Tap is much smaller than the Echo. It's lightweight at just over a pound and the mesh exterior makes it easy to grip, so you can cart it with you as you move from your kitchen to your patio.

Setup is easy. You'll download the Amazon Alexa app on iOS or Android and use it to connect the Tap to your home's Wi-Fi network. That's it. Then, just press the button on the front and starting talking to Alexa. The button works fine whether or not you enable the always-listening microphone.

Turn the Tap, and you'll find the Bluetooth pairing button on the back as well as a power button, an audio input port and a Micro-USB port. You can plug the Tap in here, or plug in the included cradle and set the Tap on that.

Pay an extra $20 for a carrying case -- called the  Amazon Tap Sling -- and you can hook it to your backpack and head out to the park to make use of that Bluetooth speaker functionality on the go. Amazon has said that portability is one of the most commonly asked for features with the Echo. The Echo Tap delivers.

What it didn't deliver before was the same level of convenience and personality of the other Alexa devices. Now, you can head into the settings on the Alexa app, and toggle the switch for ""Hands-free"" mode. Flip it on, and the Alexa app will give you a quick, one page tutorial walking you through how to control the Tap with your voice.

Like with the other Echo devices, you simply need to say the wake word, ""Alexa"" followed by your command. The other Echo devices let you switch the wake word to ""Echo,"" ""Amazon"" or ""Computer,"" but I don't mind that those options are missing.

You can mute and unmute the microphone by holding the play/pause button for three seconds. You can also put the Tap to sleep by hitting the power button. Holding the play/pause button is more tedious than punching the dedicated mute button on the Echo, but I'm willing to give the Tap a pass here, as it wasn't initially designed for this always-listening functionality.

Impressively, especially since it wasn't designed as an always-listening device, the microphone on the Tap fared well in our tests. Just like the full sized Echo, it heard me clearly at a normal speaking voice as long as I had a clear line of sight. I even walked to the adjoining room and the Tap responded to my commands. When I closed the door, I had to speak up, but that's normal even for the Echo.

The Tap also supports the Echo's ESP feature. If you have multiple Echo devices, only the closest one will respond to you, and the Tap plays nicely with your home's other Echo devices.

The only downside to this new feature is its effect on the Tap's battery life. Without the hands-free mode activated, the Tap streamed a local radio station for an average of 10 hours and 8 minutes over the course of two tests. We played the station at 50 percent volume. With the microphone always on, the battery ran for an average of 8 hours and 40 minutes. That's about 15 percent less, but consistent with Amazon's estimates and a fine tradeoff for the extra usefulness.

Other Bluetooth speakers, like the  UE Boom 2, claim up to 15 hours of streaming time, so the Tap falls a bit short competitively, even with the always-listening mode off. Still, 9 to 10 hours of playback feels sufficient for using it around the house, and 8 hours should get you through a long day of working in your garage. Remember, you can leave it on the charging stand when you're at home, or turn off the hands-free feature if you need a little extra juice.

In addition to playing music from your phone, the Tap can play music directly from  Amazon Prime Music or other popular streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora as long as you're connected to Wi-Fi.

Besides music, you can enable a host of Skills through the Alexa app, which are basically apps specific to Alexa that you can control with your voice. These range from useful features such as  ordering a ride on Uber or tracking your fitness goals to downright silly stuff such as offering up a random pickup line or a cat fact. Via the app, you can also sync the Tap to an ever-growing number of smart home devices and services, and use it as a central control point.

Alexa is a great smart home assistant. It works directly with popular smart home platforms such as  SmartThings, Wink and Insteon. It works with smart thermostats such as Nest and Ecobee3. Alexa even has a channel on IFTTT -- the online rule-making platform that ties together a large number of smart home devices -- letting you create custom commands.

The smart home platform built into the Echo devices is robust, mostly easy to use and responsive. It unifies diverse products so well that we've made it a  central part of the CNET Smart Home. As a smart home assistant, Alexa is well ahead of Siri. The HomeKit software built into recent versions of iOS allows voice controls with the iPhone's well-known voice assistant, but HomeKit works with your phone, so it's a pain for multiple users to interact with your smart home that way.

Since the Amazon Echo acts as an always listening control point, everyone in your family has equal access once it's set up. Here's where the main area where the Tap used to fall short of its predecessor. The Tap can now do everything the Amazon Echo can do, and you can take it with you as you move from room to room.

When I first took the Amazon Tap on an expedition to a nearby park, I was disappointed to find out that the voice commands don't work at all when you're not connected to Wi-Fi. Without an Internet connection, it becomes just a simple Bluetooth speaker. You can't even issue basic media control commands via voice. Fortunately, the top of the Tap has buttons for those basic functions, which jut out slightly so you can feel them in the dark.

The Tap will work with a Wi-Fi hotspot. When I put this feature to the test, it connected to our hotspot fairly easily and there wasn't much of a delay between giving a command and receiving a response. If Alexa voice input is important to you when you're on the go, the Tap can make it happen.

As an audio device, the Tap delivers sound that's fairly typical of a compact portable wireless speaker, the majority of which stream audio over Bluetooth, not Wi-Fi (we mainly tested the Tap over Wi-Fi because it's supposed to offer better streaming performance than Bluetooth). By that we mean that the Tap sounds decent with less demanding tracks -- such as ballads and easy listening music -- but falls down significantly with more complicated tracks or bass heavy material.

That's because the Tap, not surprisingly, is all about the midrange, where voices live. It's clear and forward sounding, which allows Alexa to come across with a lot of presence. Her voice is clear and loud.

There's a little treble push that makes the speaker sound a tad bright, but the lack of bass is the bigger issue. It's not completely devoid of bass, but the Tap's sound is fairly thin.

We played tracks from Amazon Music and Spotify and thought the speaker did well with material like Dave Matthews Band's ""You & Me,"" Sting's ""August Winds"" and Queensryche's ""Silent Lucidity.""

But it sounded pretty crunchy with Chairlift's ""Show U Off"" and ""Ch-Ching"" and The Smashing Pumpkins' ""Being Beige."" At about 60-70 percent volume, the speaker got overloaded whenever a lot of instruments were playing at the same time or any deep bass was introduced. The on-board digital processor (DSP) ratcheted back the bass and volume to keep things from distorting too badly, but it tended to be a losing battle, particularly with hip hop and techno tracks.

Again, this is typical of very compact wireless speakers, but even Bluetooth speakers such as JBL's older Charge 2+ sounded better, and that originally cost about the same as the Tap. The JBL has significantly better bass and sounds richer and smoother. It wasn't really a contest, even though the JBL was streaming over Bluetooth not Wi-Fi.

Of course, Amazon isn't marketing this speaker to audiophiles and critical listeners (we still have to review it with a critical ear, however). It's marketing it to people who want something to use to play background music and sound ""good enough.""

Still, aside from making the Tap sound very good, the audio doesn't distinguish itself from the multitude of  moderately priced portable wireless speakers on the market.

You'll also need to be cautious if partying with the Tap nearby. Unlike all of the competing JBL, Bose and UE speakers described here, the Tap isn't water resistant.

The newly updated $130 Amazon Tap almost makes the excellent $180 Amazon Echo obsolete. You get all of the advantages of Alexa with both, but the Tap is cheaper, lighter and portable. Thanks to the ""hands-free"" update, the only reason to go with an original Echo over a Tap is for a slightly better native speaker. The $50 Echo Dot is the best choice if you have a speaker system of your own or you don't care about music.

Whereas the Tap was once the Echo device we were hesitant to recommend, it's now an equal member of the trio at the very least and the best Echo device if you value portability. For instance, if you often find yourself wanting to talk to Alexa in the far corners of your house, go with Tap. If you like the idea of a digital assistant and also want a bluetooth speaker you can take to the park, go with the Tap. It's a battery-powered Alexa device with none of the trade-off that used to imply.

If you're just interested in a compact speaker, you're still better served looking elsewhere. Even then, take a look at everything Alexa can do before ruling out the Tap. It has fine sound quality and is now, without a doubt, the most versatile bluetooth speaker on the market."
Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation) review: (z3945)|"

Apple is rumored to be working on a Siri-powered smart home speaker with built-in cameras. The Google Home smart speaker could go on sale as soon as tomorrow, October 4.

Alexa finally has some competition.

That's almost certainly why we have a second-gen Amazon Echo Dot. With the price slashed to a near-absurd $50 (or £50 in the UK, where  	 	Alexa launched just last month), Amazon's goal is obvious -- get its virtual voice assistant into as many homes as possible now, before people have other options. That means that the Dot is designed to sell, sell, sell. And to step all over the arrival of Google Home.

Not that it needed much help. The  	original Echo Dot, launched just last March as a pint-sized follow-up to the surprise smash-hit Amazon Echo smart speaker, was by all accounts just as successful as its predecessor. It sold out quicker than even Amazon had anticipated and won rave reviews, including an Editors' Choice distinction here on CNET.

Now, after being out of stock for months, the Dot is back, and more affordable than ever. (It isn't available in Australia, but were you to import one the price converts to about AU$65.) It's just as smart as before, too, with all of the same Alexa tricks along with plenty of new ones thanks to a rapidly growing library of third-party voice app ""skills."" And, despite the lower cost, it's an even better performer than the first generation, with microphones that do a better job of hearing your voice commands over music playback or background noise.

British skills include UK services like Sky News, The Guardian and National Rail as well as control of the British Gas smart home system Hive. Unfortunately, you can't filter skills by nationality in the Alexa app so British Echo owners have to scroll through irrelevant US skills to find ones that work in the UK.

In other words, the already-great Echo Dot got a compromise-free price cut. It was an Editors' Choice-winner back in March -- now, it's close to a must-buy for just about anyone who's reading this.

""Alexa"" is Amazon's cloud-connected, voice-activated virtual assistant. She's Siri in a speaker. You wake her up by saying her name, or by saying one of your two other wake word options, ""Amazon"" or ""Echo."" The array of microphones inside of the Echo Dot is always listening, and when they hear the wake word, they'll record whatever you say next and send it off through the cloud to Amazon's servers. Those servers will figure out what you're asking for, then tell Alexa how to respond. All of this happens in about a second.

You can ask Alexa to do all sorts of things. For starters, she can stream music from Amazon Prime Music, Pandora, or Spotify. She can can play podcasts from iHeartRadio or TuneIn. She can set kitchen timers. She can look up facts. She can wake you up in the morning. She can tell your kids painfully bad jokes. She can read off the day's headlines from whatever news sources you like (including, ahem, CNET). All you have to do is ask.

On top of that, Alexa keeps getting smarter thanks to  an increasingly robust market of third-party voice apps called ""skills."" There are over 3,000 of them at this point, and each one teaches Alexa a new trick. The Uber and Lyft skills let you tell Alexa to call you a ride. The Capital One skill lets you tell Alexa to make a credit card payment. The Domino's skill lets you tell Alexa to order a pizza. A skill called The Wayne Investigation lets you talk your way through an interactive mystery set in Gotham City. You can browse through them all in the Alexa app, then pick which ones you want to enable. You can also just ask Alexa to turn one on by saying something like, ""Alexa, enable the Jeopardy skill."" And, as of now, none of them cost anything.

Alexa can control a growing list of smart home gadgets, too, including  connected lighting setups, smart thermostats, and popular smart home platforms. Ask her to turn the kitchen lights off or raise the temperature a few degrees, and she'll happily comply. Here are some of the most popular options:

We've been using Alexa to control gadgets like these  in the CNET Smart Home for over a year now, and she's terrific at it. If you have any interest in smart home tech whatsoever, then the Echo Dot is an absolute no-brainer.

One of the challenges in launching the Echo in a range of countries is making sure Alexa understands different accents and knows when words are used in different contexts.

For example, sports fans can ask for the result of the latest ""Spurs game"". The US version of the Echo will know you probably mean the San Antonio Spurs and give you a basketball result, while the UK version knows you mean Tottenham Hotspur and gives you a soccer result. The UK version also gives you British English spellings and jokey Easter eggs relating to British cultural touchstones like ""Monty Python"", among a number of uniquely UK-focused features -- this video shows just some of those British features in action.

The new Echo Dot is a little shorter than the original because there's no longer a ring around the top that you turn to control the volume. Instead, you turn things up and down using two new volume buttons on the top of the device. It's also a bit lighter, with a glossy plastic casing instead of the matte black body of generation one. And, of course, it's available in white now (which looks quite good, in my opinion). Other than that, this is the same Dot as before: same plug-and-play simplicity, same voice-activated smarts.

Like every other Echo product, the Dot is really just an access point for the Amazon Alexa cloud platform. That means that you're getting the exact same Alexa features as you would with the full-size Amazon Echo or  the battery-powered Amazon Tap. The Dot just has a less powerful speaker.

There's an ace up the Dot's sleeve, though, and that's the fact that you can connect it with existing speakers and audio setups over Bluetooth or via line-in cable. Do so, and you'll essentially make an Echo out of whatever speakers you like. The Echo and Tap can't do that -- with both, it's the built-in speakers or it's nothing.

That makes Dot the most flexible of the three, and the most intriguing, too. After all, music is a big part of the Alexa experience, and most music lovers already have an audio setup they're happy with. The Dot lets them give that audio setup a brand new brain.

Just one, small quibble: Amazon doesn't include a line-in cable with the new Echo Dot like it did with the first one. You'll need to spend five or six bucks on your own (or dig one out of your junk drawer). It's a clear sign that Amazon was trying to get the entry cost as low as possible, and a forgivable omission given that you can still connect with external speakers right out of the box using Bluetooth. Still, I'd like it better if the cable came included.

So, the Dot is an Alexa access point, and a very clever one. But is it a good one? Specifically, can its microphones hear you as well as the ones in the full-size Echo? This was a small problem with generation one, especially during music playback, where I'd often need to shout to get Alexa's attention, even at close distances. Is the new Dot any better?

This was perhaps my biggest question about Dot 2.0, so I spent a lot of time testing it out side-by-side with the original Echo Dot in a variety of settings. Impressively, at every turn Dot 2.0 seemed to be a sharper listener than the first-gen Dot, with dramatically better performance during music playback.

Just watch the video above, where I see if the Dot can hear me over the sound of its own speakers playing a Wilco song at full blast. It's the same test that the first Dot basically flunked last March, even when I was just a few feet away. The new Dot heard me from 10 feet away or more almost every single time -- no shouting necessary.

But what about external speakers, ones with a lot more oomph than the Dot? What if your TV or stereo is blasting in the background? Well, take a look for yourself at how the new Dot fares compared to the old one:

Put frankly, the new Echo Dot demolished the first Echo Dot in my tests. It's a much better listener than before, and the significance of that improvement really can't be overstated. Like I've said, the Dot's primary job is to serve as an Alexa access point. Now, it's more accessible than ever.

That isn't to say that it's perfect. There were still times where it was basically unable to hear me -- usually when I sat it right next to a speaker blasting music at a loud volume. If you can put some distance between the Dot and your speakers -- even just a couple of feet -- you'll likely be fine, but if you plan on playing a lot of loud music, spending $30 on   a separate Alexa Voice Remote to control your setup would probably be wise. (Those remotes don't appear to be available outside of the US yet, but the price comes out to about £25 or AU$40.)

The next thing on Alexa's agenda is something called ""Echo Spatial Perception,"" or ESP. It'll come in the upcoming weeks by way of a software update for all of Amazon's Echo devices (including the full-size Echo and the first-gen Echo Dot), and it'll make it so that only the one that's nearest to you responds when you say the wake word.

It's an important part of  Amazon's master plan to get Alexa not just into every home, but into every room of every home. To that end, you can buy the Echo Dot in six- or even 12-packs at a buy-five-get-one-free discount. It's a bold strategy that could yield exponential growth if it works -- I've already had one friend tell me that he preordered a six-pack, with plans of keeping one and giving the other five out as stocking stuffers.

Amazon still has work to do with Alexa, though. For starters, Amazon's Echo products still can't wrangle whole-home audio across multiple devices. Amazon needs to fix that.  A planned integration with Sonos' multiroom audio systems will mark a big step towards that goal when it arrives next year, but ideally, Amazon will find a way to make it happen with Echo hardware alone.

There are also reports that Amazon is looking into  adding spoken push notifications into Alexa's repertoire -- potentially unprompted interjections to alert you about things like upcoming appointments or bad traffic conditions in the morning. I'd welcome the addition, so long as users get plenty of control over how often Alexa pipes up, if ever.

I also think Amazon could put the light ring on top of its Echo devices to good use here, with pulsing or even color-coded lights as a sort of silent indicator that Alexa has something to share. You could then say, ""Alexa, what's up"" to hear the notification at your convenience.

When Amazon designs a product, it likes to start by distilling the pitch into a single line. With the Kindle, that line was: ""Any book, anywhere in the world, in a minute or less."" With the Amazon Echo, the pitch was simply, ""A Star Trek computer for your home.""

Tack ""for 50 bucks"" (or ""for 50 quid"") onto that pitch, and you've got the Echo Dot. Amazon succeeded in making it more tempting than ever, perhaps irresistibly so. It's just as smart as the first version, and an even better listener -- all for less money.

The ball is now in Google and Apple's court, but both of those juggernauts sat out the first quarter. Amazon has a two-year head start on each of them, and it's taken full advantage of it by diversifying the Echo lineup and by bringing eager third parties into Alexa's fold at every turn. It's hard to imagine anyone overtaking that momentum with a single device, even Google or Apple.

So should you buy the new Echo Dot? Yeah, I think you should. It's delightful, it's cutting edge, and it's as good a value as you're likely to ever see in tech. It's the future, for $50 (or £50). How can you say no to that?"
From grains to suds: iGulu automates an authentic homebrew process|"

Editors' note, June 29th, 2016: The startup behind Artbrew changed the name of the product to iGulu and launched a second crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. The piece has been updated accordingly.

Based on the specs and features, iGulu (formerly called Artbrew) could be the beer making machine I've been hoping for. Between the app and the onboard LCD controls, it looks prepared to walk the line between ease-of-use simplicity and detailed options for customization if you want them.

You'll pick from a variety of recipes or create your own. You can use your own ingredients if you have them or order packs from iGulu's website or app. At that point, you can simply add water and the ingredients and hit start, or you can further fine tune your beer if you want to customize how heavy it is, how hoppy it is, or even how alcoholic it is.

As iGulu works, you can track the progress of your creation on the app. iGulu connects to Wi-Fi, and you'll also get a push notification if you need to take any action. It handles almost everything itself, though you'll need to add yeast to the mix after it cooks so your beer can ferment. Additionally, iGulu adds up to four different types of hops automatically, but if you want more than that, you can add them in manually during the cook, and iGulu will let you know when it's the right time to do so.

The similar Picobrew Zymatic took care of the early stages of brewing as well, but you had to cool the mixture yourself before you could add the yeast and start fermenting. iGulu takes care of that for you. And you can leave the included MiniKeg inside the iGulu during fermentation, and it'll maintain an appropriate temp during the couple of weeks it takes your beer to be ready to drink.

If you'd like, you can take the MiniKeg with your fermenting beer out of iGulu, ferment it somewhere else and use a separate MiniKeg to start a different batch. Just like with unassisted homebrewing, the initial stages of brewing with iGulu will take a few hours and fermentation will last anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks.

The iGulu and the included MiniKeg let you brew 5L or 1.3 gallons of beer at a time. The Zymatic has roughly twice that capacity, but the iGulu supposedly fits nicely on your countertop. The Zymatic really didn't. iGulu also handily includes a cycle specifically designed to clean the inner compartments between batches.

With an expected retail price of $989, iGulu's also an easier splurge than the $2,000 Zymatic or Brewie -- a similar beer-brewing bot that also costs $2,000. But iGulu still has a lot to prove to be worth the cost. For one, its temperature controls will need to be precise, as even small variances can produce off flavors. It'll need to cycle water effectively to agitate the grain during the early stages of the brew or the beer will taste thin. And obviously, the rest of the mechanisms need to prove as effective and easy-to-use in practice as they are in theory.

If you're willing to gamble that iGulu fulfills its promises, you can contribute to its Indiegogo campaign and get it for a hefty discount. The lowest early-bird pricing is an attractive $550. iGulu is available worldwide. The $989 retail price converts to roughly £690 and AU$1,310 for our readers in the UK and Australia respectively. The Indiegogo discount converts to around £400 and AU$740.

Under the name Artbrew, the product previously ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and the Indiegogo campaign has already raised more than seven times the fundraising goal. So the product looks popular, we'll see if it can meet demand and live up to expectations. Kickstarter backers should get their units in September of this year. If you preorder on Indiegogo now, the estimated delivery date is December.

FlipFlic will make your blinds respond to the sun|"

Smart blinds make your home feel a lot smarter, but they also cost a boatload. For motorized and app-connected shades like Somfy's or Lutron's, you're looking at prices ranging from $250 to upward of $1,000, £700 or AU$1,325 -- and that's per unit.

In response, a few startups have endeavored to design retrofit devices that smarten your blinds and shades for under 100 bucks. The FlipFlic, now open for preorder on Kickstarter, is one of those devices.

Despite the affordable price, the FlipFlic has one major limitation. It can't open or close blinds -- it only adjusts the angle of the slats to block or let in sunlight. This approach seems restrictive, but it actually makes the device compatible with more commonly used blinds than its competition. Devices like the Smart Shades require continuous beaded chains to work with a set of shades, which can be a challenge to find.

Plus, the FlipFlic makes up for its limited functionality with the hardware included in the planned $90 (about £62 and AU$118) retail package. You get the app-connected device with light and temperature sensors, and a solar panel that powers the device. I've gotten to work with a prototype for a few days, and just in terms of hardware, the FlipFlic package looks to be an impressive deal.

The early version of the FlipFlic app I used felt sharper than many refined apps from better-funded developers. The user interface is intuitive, and the features actually feel smart. Your phone isn't just a Bluetooth remote; it offers true automation.  For instance, temperature and light sensors housed in the FlipFlic can automatically control your blinds as the room heats up, or as more sunlight enters the window.

The automation features will fill a need that hasn't yet been met by the smart-blinds industry -- if they work. I didn't subject the prototype to the rigors of review testing that I would if it were a final product. Of course, the basic remote control and scheduling worked, but final judgment of the automation must wait till the product ships.

The FlipFlic fits in nicely with the competition, undercutting the expensive smart shades, and competing well with other retrofit options. And although it's a Kickstarter project, the device has already gone through multiple iterations and has a pretty solid prototype.

When the FlipFlic package ships in January 2017 (assuming it makes its deadline -- not all Kickstarters do), it could be one of the best deals in the smart-blinds industry, if it works. And based on the company's efforts so far, the odds seem favorable."
Kuvée Bottle review:|"

What if, when you opened a bottle of wine, you didn't have to worry about finishing it within a few days? What if you could have a glass from five different bottles throughout the week, and not waste any of the excess wine? Using a dual-valve system that supposedly lets into the bottle .01 milligram of air per glass poured, Kuvée's smart wine bottle -- now available on Indiegogo for preorder at $199 for the device plus four bottles -- claims to extend the life of the opened bottle of wine considerably.

I had reservations about the system right away, simply because the bottles of wine themselves must be purchased through Kuvée, which provides specific cartridge-like bottles that fit into the Kuvée device. But the bottles were just under market price and had competitive shipping rates (free for four or more bottles), and using the device was slick. The only remaining question: does it work? The answer: not well enough.

Right now, I can't recommend the Kuvée Bottle -- especially given the planned, decidedly less-appealing retail price of $250 for the device alone. But if Kuvée's wine selection expands and the valve system on the cartridges improves, it could become a cool product for intermittent wine-drinkers and those interested in household wine technology.

The central mechanic of the Kuvée Bottle has a simple underlying concept: use valves to block air from entering the bottle as you pour a glass of wine. That way, oxidation doesn't set the bottle's quality on a slow path toward spoiled wine. Instead, the bottle should last for weeks.

Kuvée isn't the first developer to combat oxidation. For less than 10 bucks, you can easily get a canister of argon or another inert gas. Spraying one of these into a bottle before re-corking it will slow the oxidation process, lending the wine a few more days of freshness. On the other hand, you can buy a device like a Coravin for $350. The Coravin uses a hollow needle to pump argon through the cork, pressurizing the bottle of wine. Then you can pour the wine out through the needle. And when you're done, the naturally elastic cork reseals.

Kuvée doesn't concern itself with replacing the displaced wine with anything. Instead, each canister contains a collapsible bladder -- a similar approach to box wine, only with higher-quality components. Kuvée surrounds this basic mechanism with some clever technology.

The bottle that houses each cartridge has a slick touch screen, on which you can peruse information about the plugged-in cartridge's winery, tasting notes, and suggested food pairings. You also order new cartridges from this touch screen, since the Bottle is Wi-Fi connected.

The Kuvée Bottle is a sleek device, no question. I like the information it offers for each wine, and I like how easy it is to snap a cartridge in and out of the sleeve while serving people with different tastes. But a couple big questions gave me pause, even with such a clever device. First off, how's the wine selection?

For serious aficionados, a limited library of wine curated and brokered solely by Kuvée should raise some eyebrows. I found the prices of every bottle to be equal to or less than market price for the wine. But the competitive prices don't make up for a current selection of 14 wines, and a planned selection of forty-odd wines from fewer than 20 California wineries. Of course, Kuvée says those numbers will rise over time, but I would need some old-world wineries before even considering a product like this.

Such limited selection doesn't preclude the product from everyone, though. In fact, I could see a lot of younger adults like me who casually want to get into wine, and for whom a slick device like this could make learning about wine fun and easy. Plus, entertaining a crowd with varied tastes won't leave you with too much excess wine to handle.

The second big question is more important:

Here's how I tested the Kuvée Bottle. First, I bought a few bottles of 2014 Schug Carneros Chardonnay -- a good wine that was in one of the cartridges sent to me by Kuvée. Then, each day for a week, I opened a new bottle to use as a control, and compared it to both the Kuvée cartridge opened at the beginning of the week and a normal bottle opened at the same time, re-corked, and refrigerated. The goal was simple: to determine if the Kuvée Chardonnay degraded along with its normally bottled counterpart, if it retained the flavor and aroma of the fresh bottle, or landed somewhere in between.

Day 1: For the first day, we had no control. It was simply a taste test between a normal bottle of Schug Chardonnay and a Kuvée cartridge of the same. Out of six tasters in the office, the responses were mixed. Everyone agreed that they were nearly identical, but some preferred the bottle, and some the cartridge. Because the aluminum cartridge and the glass bottle also insulate differently, the minor differences in flavor could be due to slightly different temperatures. Conclusion: The cartridge and bottle are essentially identical in flavor. Kuvée doesn't lose any flavor points despite being stored differently.

Days 2 and 3: Both the day-old bottle and the Kuvée cartridge were noticeably degraded by the second and third days. The differences were subtle: the Kuvée cartridge retained better freshness, but lost some of the full-bodied flavor of the fresh Chardonnay. The bottle retained some of the flavor, but the nose was more subdued, and it tasted a little less fresh and less oaky. Responses from tasters were again mixed -- some preferring the Kuvée and some the bottle. Conclusion: The cartridge is doing something to the Chardonnay, but what exactly is unclear. It isn't simply preserved.

Day 4: For the final day, I went to a local winery to get the opinion of experts. After three days, both the bottle and cartridge were still drinkable, though neither was close to the quality of a newly opened bottle. Both the professional and I preferred the Kuvée cartridge over the three-day old bottle, but only marginally. Conclusion: The aroma and certain flavors were better preserved in the Kuvée cartridge, but the result was an unbalanced structure -- not the full body and bright character of a quality Chardonnay.

After testing the Kuvée Bottle, it seems semi-effective. But when it comes to preserving wine -- especially a Chardonnay that depends on freshness -- semi-effective is the same as ineffective. The reason I won't dismiss the Kuvée technology outright is primarily because the disappointing valve system is built into the cartridges, not the Bottle. So the cartridges could be redesigned and improved at no cost to users. For now, though, the wine isn't adequately preserved.

The $199 preorder price for the Kuvée Bottle and four assorted wines on Indiegogo before it releases in October is a pretty good deal -- if you want to invest in the company's potential. If the valve system of the cartridges improves and the selection expands considerably, the Kuvée Bottle could be a great deal. But until it realizes that potential, the retail price of $250 is just too high.

In addition, for anyone serious about displaying bottles in their homes, or aging wine before drinking it, the Kuvée smart wine bottle just won't work. And for many who drink wine regularly, finishing a bottle over the course of two or three days really isn't enough of a problem for the price.

After working with Kuvée for a week, I can't recommend the device. That said, Kuvée has the potential to improve greatly as its cartridge technology develops. In other words, the Kuvée is bright and fresh as Chardonnay, but lacks the depth of a good Cab. Here's to its potential."
August Doorbell Cam review:|"

A square gizmo that looks nothing like your standard door buzzer (and may even confuse people expecting a regular doorbell), August's $199 Wi-Fi Doorbell Cam can alert you to visitors via your existing mechanical chime (it doesn't work with digital chimes or intercom systems), but it's also equipped with a lot of smart functionality. With a built-in 140-degree camera, 1,280x960-pixel live streaming video resolution, integration with the brand's own  	 	Smart Lock, clear two-way talk, and responsive push alerts, this doorbell is definitely smarter than the model you have at home today.

But it isn't perfect. The square design didn't fit on our door frame (and might not fit on yours, either). Motion-related alerts and video storage features are supposed to be added soon, but aren't ready yet and the Doorbell Cam doesn't integrate with  	 	IFTTT, SmartThings or any other major smart home platforms.

Even so, its performance and Smart Lock integration set it apart, making August's new Doorbell Cam a product worthy of your consideration -- especially compared to  	 	the other smart doorbells we've reviewed so far.

There's one really obvious (potential) problem with August's Doorbell Cams -- something that could make DIY installation much more complicated. Yes, these buzzers look nice. Really nice, in fact. They even come in four colors -- silver, gray, copper and red -- to suit all sorts of aesthetic tastes.

But they measure 2.9 inches tall by 2.9 inches wide. That isn't  	 	that big, but it's significantly bigger than a regular ol' doorbell, measuring less than an inch wide.

And since these units have to be hard-wired to a traditional mechanical chime, you don't have a lot of leeway in terms of the install location (unless you're comfortable rerouting your wiring, and possibly having to tear into brick or another surface that requires a special drill bit). Also, many wired doorbells are installed on door frames -- and while door frame width can vary, 2.9 inches is definitely pushing it.

That begs the question, why did August opt for this square design? To support the built-in camera and all of the other tech packed into this thing? Maybe.

August definitely isn't the only smart doorbell maker that went this route. The circular   SkyBell 2.0 is roughly the same size as August's Doorbell Cam at 2.75 inches tall. The now-defunct Doorbot was 5.7 inches tall by 2.4 inches wide, and its successor, Ring, is about the same at 4.98 inches by 2.43 inches.

Be sure to measure your space before you settle on the Doorbell Cam, because its size/shape could rule it out automatically if you're dealing with a small install space -- maybe even more than the other models out there, as it's the widest.

Otherwise, the installation went smoothly, with a couple of small exceptions. August provides plastic wire connectors that aren't especially easy to use, so we used electrical tape instead. And, when you're attaching the base plate, there's a small security screw in the bottom that helps the base plate and the face plate connect and power the doorbell -- this wasn't that easy to line up, so it might take a little extra effort, but it's an important step that helps ensure solid contact between the two pieces of hardware.

After the install, download the Android or iOS August app. This is the same app that you'd use for August's first- and   second-gen Smart Locks, its Wi-Fi-enabled Connect lock accessory and its new keypad lock accessory, which makes things simple.

If you don't already have an account, the app will walk you through the setup, including configuring your doorbell. August sent me a beta version of the app and this part of the process wasn't particularly seamless, though this may have been partly due to some local Wi-Fi network spottiness. Here's how it's supposed to go:

That's it. It should take just a few minutes, but I got a handful of error messages during the connection step that slowed things down a bit. It did work eventually, though -- after five or six tries.

If the LED indicator on your doorbell is flashing green (meaning you've installed everything correctly), select Start Setup in the appName your house and the door where the buzzer is installedMake sure your phone is connected to your Wi-Fi network and it will search for the doorbellIt will then connect to the doorbell over Wi-Fi

Once your Doorbell Cam is connected, you can access it through the August app immediately. While I did miss the motion-triggered alerts and optional video clip storage that the team promises to launch in short order, overall usability and performance for this doorbell was better than the other three models I've reviewed.

First, the August app is easy to navigate -- the launch page lists any houses with related products. Click on your house -- I named ours CNET's House, and you have access to any and all August devices connected at that location. We set up a first-gen August Smart Lock, a Connect accessory to get the lock on the Wi-Fi, the new Bluetooth Keypad and the Doorbell Cam to get a sense of how all of the products interacted in the app. This was extremely straightforward.

Whenever someone rings the doorbell, any phones with access to this account or these products will get a push alert (you can extend either 24-7 or limited access to other people, depending on your comfort level). Click on the push alert and ""accept the call,"" and a live video feed will appear showing you who's at your front door.

From there, you have the option to talk to that person via your phone and the doorbell's built-in microphones and speakers. And, if you have a Smart Lock too, you can unlock or lock your front door straight from that video streaming page. This feature really rounds out the usability of this app and highlights the value for folks using both the Smart Lock and the Doorbell Cam together.

Imagine a relative with limited mobility -- they could theoretically pull up a live feed, see that a friend or family member is at the front door, talk to them and even unlock the door -- all without having to walk to the door.

And, everything worked pretty well. The alerts were prompt, the two-way talk audio quality was solid, the 1,280x960 resolution was decent and had minimal lag time and the lock was responsive 9 out of every 10 times I triggered it from the doorbell's live streaming page. (Keep in mind that a front porch or other obstruction can affect lighting and making it much more difficult for the Doorbell Cam to make out faces and other details.) This pretty good performance is unique to the Doorbell Cam, as all of the other models I've reviewed have fallen short in at least one notable way.

The standard-definition DoorBot had serious issues with lag time and overall video quality; Ring was more polished, but its 720p live stream was laggy on occasion and didn't offer a video feed as an on-demand feature (this is about to change, as Ring recently announced an all-new   Ring Pro with on-demand live streaming and a planned software update that's supposed to give the original Ring live streaming capabilities). SkyBell 2.0 allows for live streaming and some other advanced features, but had a 640x480 standard definition video feed (this has changed too, as SkyBell has released a newer version called SkyBell HD with the promise of improved video quality).

Still, I do wish that August's Doorbell Cam had an IFTTT channel or at least some sort of partnership with another manufacturer. But, its integrations with its own Smart Lock -- our favorite connected lock to date  -- makes a difference.

August isn't the first brand to add a smart doorbell to its repertoire, but its Doorbell Cam is definitely a step in the right direction for the category. Where previous models suffered from significant lag times, standard-definition live feeds and more, this model seems to nail more of the basics. Even so, we're interested in revisiting the review after August adds its upcoming advanced features, like motion detection and video storage.

There's also a clear concern about whether or not it will fit where your current doorbell is installed and if not, whether or not it's worth it to reroute your wiring to a different spot. And again, the August Doorbell Cam, along with other smart wired models, will only work with a traditional mechanical chime.

The $199 Doorbell Cam is now for sale on August.com and at Best Buy in the US. International availability is in the works, but August hasn't shared a time frame just yet; prices translate to roughly £130 and AU$275 at the current exchange rate. Overall, if you can get past the potentially tricky install, this smart doorbell could prove to be a truly useful upgrade."
C by GE Life and Sleep LED Starter Pack review:|"

Smart lighting is a common starting point for the connected home, but with a lot of your options, you'll need to keep a control hub plugged into your router or understand what ZigBee is.

GE wanted to lower that barrier of entry with its C by GE LED Starter Pack. For $50, you'll get four smart LED bulbs that need no hub, and instead, connect directly with your phone over Bluetooth. Two of these four bulbs -- the C by GE ""Sleep"" LEDs -- will even change color temperatures automatically throughout the day, going from a hot, bluish, get-the-hell-out-of-bed tone in the morning to a warm, orangey, you-are-getting-sleepy shade in the evening. The other two bulbs, the C by GE ""Life"" LEDs, are more basic, offering remote smartphone dimming control at a fixed color temperature in between those two extremes.

Four smart bulbs for 50 bucks is an attractive deal, especially when two of those bulbs are color-tunable. Compare that with the Wi-Fi-enabled Lifx White 800 LED, a color-tunable competitor that costs $40 apiece. Osram's Lightify LEDs are another color-tunable alternative -- they cost $30 each, but you'll need to buy a one-bulb starter kit for $60 in order to use them. GE's lights are the best bargain of the bunch -- but I'm not sure I'd recommend them -- at least not yet.

The problem? These Bluetooth bulbs don't work with any larger smart-home platforms yet -- that means that you need to be within Bluetooth range (about 50 feet) in order to use them. You also can't make a lighting schedule or set a timer for when things should come on or off.

The only scheduling option you'll get is the ""Follow the Sun"" feature, which changes the color temperature on the Sleep LEDs automatically at pre-programmed times. Even those changes won't work if you aren't in Bluetooth range.

You can't control these bulbs with your voice, either. Other smart lights will let you sync up with Siri or with her Amazon Echo-based counterpart, Alexa, but not these bulbs. That's a bit of a surprise, as GE told us last year that they were working on color-tunable smart lights that would work with Apple HomeKit for Siri-powered voice controls.

That really just leaves the app as your primary means of controlling these lights (aside from, you know, the light switch).

With its minimalistic design, the app is clean-looking and easy to use. It does an especially good job of visualizing the shifting color schedule of the Follow the Sun feature, and also makes good work of walking users through the process to create scenes that let them change multiple lights to preprogrammed settings with a single tap.

But these app controls are largely beside the point. Ideally, you'd use the app to program, group and schedule your lights when you first get them -- and then never open it again.

I speak from experience here. In my own home, I have smart lights that fade on above my bed each morning to wake me up, and ones that turn on automatically when a motion sensor catches me entering the room. It's been months since I've needed to open the apps for any of them (and that was only because I moved into a new house and needed to set things back up). With C by GE, I'd need to open the app every time I wanted to dim a light or trigger a scene.

I also wish the bulbs were a bit brighter. In my tests, I clocked the Life LED at 661 lumens -- well short of the 800 lumens you'd want from a 60W replacement. The Sleep LED did a bit better, coming in at over 700 lumens, but that was only in the hot blue AM mode. The brightness fell significantly at the other two color temperatures: 541 lumens for the midrange Day mode and a paltry 235 lumens at the orange-toned PM mode. I get that the PM mode is meant to help you wind down before bed, but that's still barely enough light to comfortably read a book under.

These bulbs stand to improve with time. GE says that they're looking into things like voice control and compatibility with third-party smart-home platforms, too. Tethering these bulbs to Bluetooth-friendly hubs like the SmartThings Hub or the Wink Hub would be a good starting point, as both would let you schedule the lights and control them from beyond Bluetooth range.

For now, though, the C by GE bulbs sit in their own walled-off garden. As happy as I am to see color tunable smart bulbs at a much lower price, I'd need to see those walls start to come down before I'd start to buy in."
Save money up front, save water over time with the Blossom 8 Smart Watering Controller|"

Blossom's lowering the barrier to entry for a smart sprinkler setup. Starting today, you can preorder the Blossom 8 Smart Watering Controller for $100. It'll be widely available in May for $130, a significant price cut from the original Blossom's $180 price and well below the $250 cost of its main competitors -- Rachio and GreenIQ.

Blossom's working on expanding overseas, but the Blossom 8 will be a US-only product for now. The $130 price converts to approximately £90 and AU$170.

Blossom designed its original Smart Watering Controller around all-encompassing accessibility. This new model trims a lot of those extras off for the sake of affordability. The original was weatherproof, featured Power-line in addition to Wi-Fi in case your controller was far from your router, and covered 12 zones. The Blossom 8 fittingly covers eight zones, is Wi-Fi only, and has a slim, low-profile design that needs to be kept indoors since it lacks the same resistance to the elements.

If you need any of those more robust features, the $180 Blossom will still be available, so the company's logic with this new model works well. If you don't need those options, you can pay less to cut them. The inner workings and smarts of the two devices remain the same.

Purchase either Blossom Controller and it'll act as a retrofit hub for your existing in-ground irrigation system. Download the free iOS or Android app, and you can manage your watering schedule on the go. Blossom will also monitor the weather, and will make adjustments to the schedule accordingly, so you'll never accidentally run your sprinklers after it rains.

It's the same basic premise behind Rachio and GreenIQ, and I'm a little disappointed that Blossom's newest didn't take steps to match its competitors in terms of interoperability. GreenIQ has direct integrations with a couple of plant sensors. Rachio works with a number of smart home platforms like Wink and Nest, and both Rachio and GreenIQ work with online rule maker IFTTT, allowing a range of options for a wider smart-home integration.

Blossom's logic here -- to keep things simple -- doesn't impress me, as not allowing the option for interoperability isn't the same as making the controller easy to use. Neither Rachio nor GreenIQ force you to use their smart home integrations, but you have them if you want them.

However, Blossom 8 enhances the advantage of its predecessor -- the price -- so anyone interested in dipping their toe into smart gardening for the first time might be most tempted by a standalone device priced competitively with non-connected options."
D-Link DCS-2630L review:|"

I'm conflicted about D-Link's $180 DCS-2630L indoor security camera. Complete with a 180-degree wide-angle lens, local storage via a microSD card slot, highly customizable settings and fine performance, it's definitely recommendable.

But, there's one big caveat, and I mean that literally: This camera is huge.

Where competitors like the $200 Nest Cam, the $150 Kodak CFH-V20 and the $190 Samsung SmartCam HD Plus stand somewhere in the 4-to-5-inch range, D-Link's DCS-2630L is closer to 6 inches. Its width and depth are similarly super-size, too, meaning this camera will take up noticeably more space than most other models.

Dimensions may not be a deal-breaker for most, but the idea with home security is discretion. And if a camera isn't especially discreet, it should at least be pretty, a nice design element that works with your home decor.

D-Link's DCS-2630L is neither, so I'm stumped. Sure, the glossy, black plastic finish is fine, but it also isn't something I'd want to draw undue attention to.

This camera is also difficult to set up. As with the brand's Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Camera and its Wi-Fi Smart Plug, the step-by-step instructions are convoluted at best and glitchy at worst. For instance, the last step in the setup process is creating a new account on the Mydlink Lite app (available for Android and iOS devices). Typically that happens at the beginning of gadget configuration, and it's a logical first step. Not so with D-Link.

In this case, I received an error message when I tried to create an account even though I had already successfully connected the camera to Wi-Fi and finished all of the other steps. Specifically it said, ""Could not connect to the Mydlink server.""

And instead of taking me to the previous step so I could try again, it canceled the entire configuration, forcing me to reset the camera (there's a tiny pinhole on the back of the camera for resetting; press it until the light begins to blink red). Other times it said ""Connection timed out"" before I could complete the installation. Thus, I became very familiar with the DCS-2630L's reset button.

When I finally did get through all of the steps, the software told me that the email address I had been trying to register for the good part of an hour was already registered. So, even though the app gave me several error messages that prevented me from completing the set-up, it must have actually worked during one of those earlier attempts. Frustrating.

Things did get better after that initial configuration, though. The app, although not as intuitive as Nest's, was easy enough to navigate.

You can view a live feed in either 720p or 1080p, two of the best possible high-definition streaming resolutions available to DIY security cameras today (even so, this camera's feed isn't as crisp as the Nest Cam's). The DCS-2630L has two-way talk so you can surprise an unsuspecting family member -- or, more seriously, yell at an intruder. You can take a picture on demand, and it will show up alongside other photos you take with your phone.

It also has night vision, motion and sound detection, activity zones, optional push alerts, a Web app and local storage with clips you can view within the app (I used a 128GB microSD card) -- everything worked well.  But local storage is the feature worth highlighting here, because it's something that will either make or break your security camera buying decision.

Many cameras, like the Nest Cam, the Kodak CFH-V20, the ArcSoft Simplicam and others rely on cloud storage. Cloud storage means that your continuous footage or activity-based recordings are stored on a remote server.

From both a security and an accessibility standpoint, a lot of folks prefer local storage. That's one way the DCS-2630L sets itself apart. While it isn't the first to offer this feature, it is the very first DIY model we've reviewed that has both a 180-degree field of view and local storage.

And unlike Icontrol's Piper NV, a DIY security system with a built-in 180-degree fisheye lens, D-Link's lens doesn't have nearly as much of that classic fisheye distortion, making it easier to actually see what your camera is seeing.

The one thing sorely missing from the D-Link camera is integration with products from other manufacturers. Today's smart home market is all about open APIs and creating opportunities for third-party devices to join forces. Strangely, D-Link does have an assortment of IFTTT channels and compatible products through Samsung's SmartThings, but none that work with this specific camera.

I feel pretty ambivalent about the $180 D-Link DCS-2630L. While it offers a 180-degree field of view and local storage, it's hard to set up, it doesn't work with third-party products, and it's giant. Its live stream isn't as clear as the Nest Cam's either, even with the same 1080p resolution.

Still, it's hard to overlook the DCS-2630L's relatively distortion-less 180-degree lens and its ability to store footage locally. If these are two features you prioritize, this D-Link camera will be worth your money. If not, I'd take a look at some other options."
Philips 40W Equivalent Candelabra LED review:|"

What's the difference between a non-dimmable LED and a dimmable LED that you'd never want to dim?

Answer: about five or six bucks.

At least, it is if you're talking about candelabra LEDs. After eighteen hours of tests, I couldn't find a single dimmable option that dimmed without flickering. The average price of those dimmable bulbs? A little over nine dollars. Each.

That makes the explicitly non-dimmable candelabra LED from Philips -- which sells in a $10 three-pack at Home Depot -- a pretty appealing option. You won't be able to dial the light down, but it does offer sufficient brightness, efficiency, and light quality. It's nothing special, but at a few bucks per bulb, it really doesn't have to be.

The non-dimmable candelabra LED from Philips didn't win any of our performance tests, but it didn't lose any of them, either. At 322 lumens, it offers brightness that's just below average, but high enough to earn a passing grade as a 40W equivalent. At a power draw of 4.5 watts, it's putting that brightness out at about 71.6 lumens per watt. In terms of efficiency, that's almost the exact average for the entire candelabra LED category.

Philips also found the middle of the pack in our thermal management tests, where we test to see how much heat affects each bulb's performance. After switching it on in our integrating sphere and waiting ninety minutes, the brightness had flat-lined at about 86 percent. Though not the impressive 92.4 percent we saw from a $7 EcoSmart bulb, it's still an acceptable result, and good enough for fifth place out of eleven bulbs tested.

I was also happy that the Philips LED managed to put out a fairly even spread of light, including a decent amount of downward-cast light. This came as a bit of a surprise, as other bulbs with the same form factor did much worse in the same test.

The reason why those torpedo-shaped LEDs typically struggle is because the bulb's glass doesn't extend out any further than the base, where the heat sink lives. This means the heat sink ends up blocking the downward light, as you see with bulb number one in the picture above, a 40W equivalent from EcoSmart.

With Philips -- shown above in the middle -- you've got a nifty, pedestal-shaped diffuser in the center of the bulb to help angle the light downward more effectively. It works to an extent, though you still get a bit of a dark spot directly below the bulb.

All told, the Philips bulb checks off all of the boxes I'd expect a $3 LED to check It's bright enough, it's efficient enough and it isn't ugly. You won't be able to buy bulbs individually, but you're probably going to want matching multiples anyway, and at $10 for a three-pack, you'll be spending less than half of what you'd need to spend for dimming LEDs. If you're looking for a bargain-priced efficiency upgrade for your chandelier, this is about as good as you're currently going to get.

Cree TW Series 40W Equivalent Candelabra LED review:|"

If you're in the market for candelabra LEDs, the chances are good that you need more than one. Cree is banking on this fact and selling its own 40W equivalent candelabra LEDs in three-packs. By forcing you to buy more than one at a time, the cost per bulb goes down a little bit. At about $20 for the three-pack, you'll be getting each bulb for less than $7.

That makes Cree's bulb more affordable than almost all of the other candelabra LEDs that we tested, but it's still a lot to pay. Consider that standard 60W replacement LEDs are now selling for less than $5, with payback periods (the amount of time it takes to recoup the upfront cost with energy savings) of less than a year. At $7, each of Cree's 5W candelabra LEDs would take almost two years to pay for themselves -- still good, but not as good as the payback period for a standard LED.

What's more, Cree's candelabra LED wasn't as strong a performer as some of the other bulbs we tested -- including the top-performing EcoSmart candelabra LED, which also costs about $7 per bulb. Though it offers plenty of brightness for a decorative chandelier light (356 lumens, per our spectrometer and integrating sphere setup), Cree's bulb performed poorly in our heat tests, and flickered a little bit when we tried to dim it.

Cree's candelabra LED does have a few things going for it, though. First, it's a ""TW Series"" bulb, the TW standing for ""True White."" That means that it features a color rendering score in the low nineties -- better than most LEDs, which typically score about ten points lower. With a high color rendering score, you can expect this bulb to make the colors in your home look a bit better -- whiter whites, deeper reds, that sort of thing.

The TW effect was a bit more subtle with this bulb than with other TW Series bulbs we've tested -- probably due to the fact that it's a smaller, dimmer LED -- but if you're using several of them in a single chandelier or fixture, you'll notice the uptick in color quality.

Cree's candelabra LED also features a semi-unique design, with a ""spike"" of light running up through the center of the bulb. It's a neat-looking build, though I wish the construction was sturdier. Each of the bulbs in my three-pack rattled a bit when I gave them a shake. It also didn't do as good a job as other bulbs we tested at directing light downward.

All in all, this is one of your better LED options in the candelabra category, but I wouldn't blame you one bit for sticking it out with fluorescents, halogens, or incandescents for another year or two. None of the LED candelabra bulbs we tested offered flicker-free dimming, and none of them are as affordable as I'd like -- at least not yet.

Forget to take your meds? This smart device and app will remind you|"

It can be hard to remember to take your medicine, whether you're on fluoxetine or Flintstones vitamins. A new smart device wants to use technology to help you keep up with your meds.

The Hero Smart Appliance is a medication dispenser that lets you schedule when it will dole out your pills. The Wi-Fi connected device will also monitor how much medicine you have left, send alerts when it's time for a refill and notify you when a user has taken their medicine (useful if, for example, more than one person uses the machine or if you're monitoring another person's usage). The Hero became available today for online pre-ordering for $399 (about £280 or AU$540); the Hero company expects the retail price to be about $999 (£700 or AU$1,345).

It's pretty easy to operate the Hero. After you enter your name and connect the Hero to the Internet, you type in the name of your medicine, how many doses you need to take and at what time you need to take them. You put your pills into a little container that goes inside the Hero, and it will dispense them into a cup at the appropriate time. You can also access your medicine off-schedule if need be.

The Hero company said the smart appliance could find a lot of use for caregivers who have to monitor another person's medication usage because of the scheduling ability and app notifications. An automatic dispenser could make it easier for someone caring for an older parent, for example, and give them one less thing to worry about. The Hero could also be a boon for folks who take multiple pills and have a hard time keeping things straight -- it's a big step up from those plastic pill holders you can grab at the pharmacy. And even if you only take one pill, the app can help you remember to take it when you should and, in the best-case scenario, stay healthy.

Price is going to be a huge obstacle, however, in getting the Hero to the people who could most benefit from it. There are also limitations on how much medicine can be stored in the device (a maximum of 10) and the type of medicine (pills only, no liquids). The Hero company is exploring options, including Medicare reimbursement in the US, that could help keep costs of the unit down. And the product has a huge responsibility to make sure it keeps all those pill cartridges organized and dispensing the right medicine at the right time.

Garageio review:|"

When you hear the phrase ""garage door opener,"" you probably think of the little black-and-gray remote clipped to the sun visor in your car -- that thing that controls your garage door opener. But over the last few years, major developers like Chamberlain, and smaller ones like Garageio in Columbus, Ohio, have begun to market app-connected garage door openers.

Garageio's self-named device is a relatively simple black box that hardwires into your current garage door opener. From there it integrates with platforms like Amazon Echo and IFTTT -- the app that builds triggers between normally unconnected apps and devices. Despite its clever integrations, Garageio still doesn't feel quite slick enough to pull off its $199 base price (not to mention an extra $10 for each additional garage door, up to three).

For anyone ready to get their garage into the smart-home mix, Garageio is a pretty solid buy. But until its app gets a little deeper and its integration smooths out, this product isn't ready for everyone.

Installing Garageio is a little more involved than I'd prefer (more on that later), but once the system is up and running, app connection is simple. In fact, it's a little too simple. When you open the app, the interface is an orange garage door that you swipe up to open or swipe down to close. It works, but for $200 I'd like to see an app with more to offer. Luckily Garageio introduces new features elsewhere.

Integrations with Amazon Echo and IFTTT are a breeze to set up, and they're the main distinction Garageio can claim from competitors like the Chamberlain MyQ. With Garageio, you can control your garage doors with a voice command, or trigger them to open via geolocation through the IFTTT app.

Disappointingly, these two integrations aren't equally slick. IFTTT integration is mostly open to your imagination, but Amazon Echo's commands are basic and sometimes frustrating to use. Since Echo's Garageio skill isn't native, you can't just ask Alexa to open your garage. You have to say things like, ""Alexa, tell Garageio to open my small garage door,"" or ""Alexa, ask Garageio if my garage doors are open."" After a while, it felt like I was having a middle school feud with Garageio, and Echo was just caught in the crossfire.

IFTTT, on the other hand, works wonders. In fact, without IFTTT, I would like Garageio much less than I do. But automating your garage door with geofencing or other triggers might create some safety questions. Chamberlain, Garageio's biggest competitor, actually refuses to work with triggering platforms like IFTTT so users don't accidentally open their garage doors while they're away.

This is an interesting question: Should security be left up to users, or controlled by developers? As long as you're careful with IFTTT, you should be fine. Keep integrations clear-cut, and don't use anything that isn't normally associated with garage doors to trigger them (e.g., if I send an email, open the garage door). And if you are careful, then the automation possibilities do elevate Garageio above its competition.

Garageio's design works. Yes, installation involves fiddling with tape, wires and screwdrivers, all while perched on a stepladder. And yes, it'll take a lot longer than the 15 minutes per door the website advertises (it took me about two hours to install it on two doors). But the wires and inputs on the black box are clearly labeled, and the online directions are relatively straightforward and visual.

You can also double up the Garageio's wiring on top of any existing wires you have. That means you get to keep any buttons you've wired around your home to manually control your garage doors

I ran into two issues while setting up Garageio. First, while Garageio provides lists of compatible and incompatible makes and models (to help personalize instructions), those lists are incomplete. The Chamberlain opener on one garage door at the CNET Smart Home is on the compatibility list, but the Craftsman model on the other door is not, so it required a little guesswork for installation. Luckily it worked, but I'd like to see more comprehensive installation support for users.

The second issue with installation was the wires themselves. Garageio includes abundant wiring for any installation needs, but only adds some plastic clips to secure those wires. For a setup that holds rolls of wire over a moving chain that could easily jam, I'd like to see some more reliable supplies included in the box.

This is where Chamberlain's all-wireless installation has an edge over Garageio. It's faster and easier to set up, and there's no risk of jamming.

For many smart-home aficionados or Amazon Echo users, getting your garage to open automatically when you drive up, or getting Alexa to control it, is worth Garageio's $200 price tag, and justifies its premium over the less capable, $129 MyQ from Chamberlain. For me personally, IFTTT compatibility is the strongest recommendation for Garageio. I just want to see a deeper app, and native control through Amazon Echo. It's far ahead of its competition in terms of its programmability, but even there, Garageio still has room to improve."
Now your smartphone can help you clean your teeth|"

Want the pearliest of pearly whites? There's an app for that -- and a brush.

Oral-B's latest electric toothbrush, the Genius 9000, connects to an app on your smartphone via Bluetooth to help track your brushing and teach you better technique.

Connect your phone to the toothbrush and fire up the app. Stick your phone on your bathroom mirror at eye level with the screen facing you (a mount with a suction cup is included). The app will help you line up your face with the view from the front facing camera. Once you start brushing, the app uses the camera to judge the position of the toothbrush in your mouth in order to gauge how much time you're spending brushing each zone of your teeth.

There's a representation of your teeth on the screen, split up into different zones. When you've brushed for long enough, each of those zones will turn white. Your goal then is to brush each area for long enough to turn all of the areas white. The aim is to not only teach you proper technique in your brushing, but to also encourage you to keep it up.

You'll be able to view your brushing history on the app, should you want to, and a handy pressure sensor in the handle alerts you with a red light if you're pushing too hard and damaging your gums.

I tried the brush at Oral-B's stand at Mobile World Congress here in Barcelona. While I found it a little odd brushing my teeth in front of a crowd of watching strangers, I did find that the brush and camera combo was good at recognising whereabouts I was brushing. Whether it's enough to make my smile more dazzling than it already is -- a tough ask, frankly -- is something I'll have to judge when I can jam one of these into my face on a regular basis.

The Genius 9000 is due to hit shops in the UK and the rest of Europe in July, and the US in December. Prices are expected to be somewhere between $200 and $300 (which converts to around £145 to £215)."
LG Rolling Bot will monitor your home, freak out your pets (hands-on)|"

LG has wrapped up home monitoring and pet entertainment all into one cute ball. The manufacturer debuted its Rolling Bot this week at the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona.

The bot is a hybrid security system/smart-home device/pet toy that's not unlike a Sphero BB-8 toy with a more serious feature set. At its core, it's a mobile home monitor: you can remotely control this ball-shaped device through your phone and receive video and audio footage of what's happening while you're away from your house. The bot can also connect and interact with other smart-home devices, such as your TV and lights, through Bluetooth and your home's Wi-Fi network.

But the most fun part of the bot is its pet-friendly features. The pet mode lets you to talk to your pet through the device's speakers, and it will even dance and fire a laser pointer to keep your dog or cat stimulated.

Pricing and availability for the Rolling Bot have yet to be announced.

Keen Home Smart Vent review:|"

Editor's Note: Keen Home has released some hardware and firmware updates that have significantly changed the product experience. Our review has been updated to reflect those changes.

A few months ago, I tested Keen Home Smart Vents and gave them a poor review. Terrible connectivity made some of the features practically untestable, and a design flaw made ceiling installations dangerous. With ample feedback from users and reviewers, Keen Home continued work on its product. Now, these $80 smart vents are beginning to look compelling.

The idea behind Keen's vents is that you can personalize the temperature of individual rooms around your house. If one room tends to get colder in the winter, the vents can direct more heat to it, or if you like your bedroom cooler, you can divert warm air away from it. On a basic level, Keen performs. If you're interested in smart vents, or you have a compatible smart thermostat, Keen Home Vents are definitely worth checking out, especially as their features continue to develop.

The Keen Home system takes some time to set up, but it's hard to imagine how anyone could make it much easier. The real hassle is actually perching on a ladder to install ceiling vents, if you have them, or screwing the fixtures into the wall. Keen has also remedied most of the old connectivity problems, so syncing the vents to the hub is a breeze.

In my experience, the installation takes 15-to-20 minutes per unit. Depending on how many you install, it could take an hour, or an afternoon.

Once the setup is complete, using the Keen Home app is intuitive. The app is streamlined, and now, when you run into connection problems with a vent, the app realizes it and automatically pulls up troubleshooting recommendations. I like this addition, especially after my original experience with the system that left me confused and exasperated.

Where Keen Vents excel is in design. Now that the falling-from-the-ceiling problem is fixed, users are left with a minimalist aesthetic that works with almost any decor. The white faceplates attach magnetically onto the vent itself, so unlike traditional vents, you can simply pull off the plate to clean the slats or change the batteries.

Even without the faceplate, the vents look slick. A small LED light recessed in the structure of the vent itself is the primary means of communication between user and device. And for the most part, its blinking patterns are easy to understand: green for ""connected"", yellow for ""searching for connection,"" and so on. But just in case, I found it helpful to keep the included translation card handy while setting up.

The one design shortcoming for Keen's Vents is a sizing issue. Typically, vents are secured by screwing through the edge of the faceplate. Since Keen's faceplates are affixed magnetically, a problem arises. The flanges you screw into the ceiling or wall are positioned more narrowly than the edge of the faceplate, so the holes don't always reach the drywall.

It wasn't a serious problem; for most of the fixtures, I just had to drill at an angle to securely anchor the device. But some adjustability would be helpful for homes with different needs.

The physical and app design are both slick, but what makes smart vents worth the price tag is -- you guessed it -- smarts. The problem is, Keen doesn't offer enough of those right now to really impress.

Keen works with the Nest Learning Thermostat, for instance, but the extent of its cooperation is basically offering another command center on your phone for the thermostat. Keen Home says more automation and better pattern-learning is on the near horizon, but at present the only automation -- that all the vents coordinate to direct airflow to particular rooms that don't receive enough -- requires the help of the user.

A partnership with the Ecobee smart thermostat is coming in the summer, which is notable because Ecobee's room-by-room temperature sensors will help make Keen's vents temperature-responsive. When this feature arrives, the vents will begin to really feel smart.



Keen Home's Smart Vents might be great products six months from now -- if integration and automation expand considerably. At this point, I'm not sure whether to be skeptical because of Keen's near-broken first effort, or to be hopeful because of its quick recovery.

Either way, if you're interested in smart vents, Keen's entries will certainly be worth keeping an eye on. And if you have a compatible thermostat, they are worth consideration."
Elgato Eve Energy review:|"

Elgato, the company that brought us products like the Eve Room and the Thunderbolt Drive, is shooting for a tough goal with its Eve Energy Switch and Power Meter: to make a difference in the saturated market of connected outlets. The recent proliferation of these products makes sense. Their simple retrofit approach to automating homes is affordable and accessible to casual consumers. Want to schedule when your light bulbs turn on? Or track your TV's energy consumption? Or smarten up dumb appliances, like humidifiers or speakers? Smart plugs could be the solution.

The problem is, at $50 a pop -- and the Elgato Eve Energy's price is par for the course -- users want a plug that really feels smart. After all, remote control plugs cost only a couple bucks, and timed plugs are the same story. And Elgato almost succeeds. I can schedule commands, control it with Siri, track energy usage, and set up scenes. But while the Eve Energy boasts those features, it also succumbs to a big problem: you need an Apple TV to control it remotely. So it may be a solid purchase for Apple TV users, but it's definitely not a must-buy. And for non-Apple TV users, it's just not the best plug on the market.

Eve Energy's biggest competitor is the iDevices Switch -- the other big HomeKit-enabled smart plug. Although Eve works better with Siri thanks to the customizable device naming in the app, iDevices wins out on many of the features. Most notably, you don't need an Apple TV to control it remotely.

If Elgato wants to compete in the broader market, it also needs to take fuller advantage of its Bluetooth technology. For instance, Eve doesn't take any advantage of Bluetooth's unique capabilities to detect user-presence and respond accordingly, as the Zuli Smart Plug does.

Finally, the Elgato app needs improvement. The app is functional, but it's not as intuitive as the iDevices counterpart. The Elgato app is also missing triggers, a feature that's key to home automation. The lack of triggers might be a problem with the HomeKit platform, not just Elgato's app, but it's a problem that needs to be solved before Eve Energy competes with more automation-friendly plugs, like the IFTTT-compatible Belkin WeMo Insight Switch.

Overall, the Elgato Eve Energy Switch and Power Meter isn't a bad smart plug, but in an increasingly dense market, and with a $50 price tag, it just doesn't do enough to justify itself.

Setup is easy.The Elgato app offers more customization, like personalized Siri commands and guest access, than most other HomeKit apps.Siri works well with Eve Energy. You don't have to say ""Turn off my Eve plug."" You can just say, ""Turn off the fan.""Elgato Eve is responsive, with almost no latency when you toggle it on or off.

You can't control the Eve Energy remotely unless you have an Apple TV. Elgato Eve Energy features no dimming capabilities.The design is plain, and the app isn't very intuitive to use."
BrewJacket brings style -- sous-vide style -- to your homebrew|"

It was only a matter of time. As sous vide immersion circulators increase in popularity and number, it was inevitable that someone would repurpose that tech for brewing beer. That's the idea behind the BrewJacket Immersion Pro -- put the device into whatever container you use to ferment your homebrew, and it'll heat or cool the liquid appropriately until your beer is ready to drink. The ability to heat is new to the Pro version of the BrewJacket circulator, which launches today on Kickstarter.

Fermentation is typically the final, and longest, stage of homebrewing. First, you mix your ingredients over the course of a couple of active hours of cooking. Then, you take your unfermented beer (called wort), introduce it to yeast and let it sit for a few weeks while the yeast does its thing, i.e. ferments.

During fermentation, you want to carefully control the temperature of your beer or the yeast can produce undesirable flavors. That's where BrewJacket comes in. The product is essentially a heat-conducting rod attached to a control panel. You insert the rod into your fermenting wort, and the control panel sits on top. You use the control panel to pick the appropriate temperature for the style of beer you're brewing, and, in theory, you won't have to worry about your beer again during fermentation. You'll need to drill a hole into the top of your fermenting container for this to work, or you can buy a predrilled top separately from the BrewJacket site.

The BrewJacket Pro will be worthwhile for many home brewers if it effectively adds peace of mind and proper temperature control over the weeks of fermentation without introducing any off flavors of its own. It would also be a nice add-on for anyone who wants to use mechanized beer-making robots such as the PicoBrew Zymatic or Brewie that take care of the beer-making process up to, but not including, fermentation. The BrewJacket could also make brewing more appealing and accessible to those who live in small spaces, since you won't need a dedicated fridge or temperature-controlled area to store your fermenting wort.

Here are the specs of the BrewJacket Pro:

Hopefully, the BrewJacket Pro works well, as it would be pretty disappointing to drill a hole into an important piece of your brewing equipment for a device that can't live up to expectations. And since the BrewJacket Pro changes the temperature slowly, you'll still want another means of crash-cooling your beer,  a step between cooking and fermenting your wort that can be tricky.

If you only need to cool your beer, you can purchase the original BrewJacket Immersion now on the company's site. Or you can preorder the BrewJacket Immersion Pro via the Kickstarter campaign. It'll ship anywhere in the world with an expected delivery date sometime this fall. At retail, the Immersion Pro will cost $350, which converts to approximately £240 and AU$500 for our readers in the UK and Australia. A few early-bird discounts on the campaign will net you an Immersion Pro for less. Check back here once the BrewJacket Pro hits the market for a full performance review.

IC Real Tech Allie Home review:|"

Let's start with this  -- I can't recommend IC Real Tech's $599, £419, AU$845 Allie Home camera to anyone who's considering using it as a DIY security device. (At least, not as it is right now.)

I know that people don't often agree about home security, particularly what sort of set up is best, or at the very least adequate.

A comprehensive multi-device system, installed and managed by a professional firm like ADT is right for some. Others are content with a single security camera placed in a particularly vulnerable spot. And there are still plenty of folks who don't use any sort of security tech in their homes at all.

My grandfather, for instance, used to balance an upside-down glass Coca-Cola bottle on top of the front doorknob. If he woke up to glass shattering, he was ready to rumble with an intruder. (And yes, home security gadgets were a thing by then. He just preferred his more badass method.)

Nowadays, though, there are more home security options than ever before. That doesn't mean a Coke bottle won't cut it, just that there are a lot of products out there that are specifically designed to alert you when a potential problem takes place -- whether you're home or not.

We've reviewed a lot of them, but I've never been quite so stumped by a security product as I am with the very pricey DIY Allie Home camera.

Yes, the camera is neat. It's decked out with two, 180-degree fisheye lenses so you can live stream and record or take photos in a 360-degree environment. (You have to pay extra for the cloud recording/storage feature -- it starts at $6.95 per month for 24 hours.)

This is definitely a unique design among DIY security cameras. Sure, some traditional pan-and-tilt models can rotate 360 degrees, but you aren't ever able to see all 360 degrees at the same time. So compared to models like the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Camera, Foscam's FI9826P Plug and Play Wireless IP Camera or even the newer Zmodo Pivot, the Allie Home's 360-degree live stream is a serious security asset. Of course, you can stick a wide-angle camera, like the 180-degree Icontrol Piper NV in the corner of a room and see pretty much everything with ease.

The problem is that this camera has no additional security features as of today (aside from two-way talk and night vision, both of which worked fine). It doesn't have an Arm/Disarm function, it doesn't pick up on motion or sound activity and shoot you a push or email notification with a clip of the action. There's no built-in siren, geofencing capability, suite of environmental sensors to track ambient temperature or humidity -- there's just...nothing else beyond it's ability to see the whole room.

The flip side of this 360-degree camera's disappointing ""Security"" mode is an Event mode that also helps speak to its dual nature. Toggle the app setting from ""Security"" to ""Event"" and you can record important events, like birthdays or wedding. You can even tack on any smartphone-friendly VR headset to see whatever the Allie Home sees in an even more immersive way. (The VR function is neat, to be sure, but it doesn't add anything in terms of security features.)

And I'm just as confused by Event mode as Security mode, given that Allie Home isn't battery-powered. You know all of those birthdays and weddings you're supposed to record at remote locations? You'll have to make sure you can find a power outlet, which makes it impossible for the camera to be in the middle of the action, the way IC Real Tech wants. That is, unless you bring a long extension cord with you. Wherever the Allie Home goes, its power adapter goes too.

Overall, I'm struggling to think of a reasonable use case for this specific product. IC Real Tech did debut a battery-powered version called the Allie Go at CES earlier this year and the untethered Go model would likely be a lot better for recording events.

Back to the Allie Home -- unless IC Real Tech injects a lot more security functionality into its cool, but limited two-sided camera, I can't think of any reason why someone should spend $599 for it.

Note: The team does plan to give Allie Home motion-sensing capabilities in the future, so check back for updates on that front."
Netgear Arlo Q review:|"

Netgear's Arlo Q indoor security camera, available in the US, UK and Australia for $220/£170/AU$349, doesn't do anything revolutionary. It doesn't have a 360-degree view or IFTTT (or really any integrations with products/services from other companies, for that matter), it isn't rated for outdoor use like the brand's other Arlo cam and it won't blow you away with its app or hardware design, but the Arlo Q is a safe choice that I can easily recommend. (And isn't 'safe' what we really want when we're talking about home security?)

Put simply: the Arlo Q works. Its motion and sound alerts were prompt, the activity zones I created issued consistent alerts only when motion took place in that specific area and the 1080p high-definition live streaming in day- and night-vision mode, two-way talk, video playback, Arm/Disarm function and scheduling all worked very well. Even so, the Arlo Q's live streaming wasn't quite as solid as Nest Cam's, particularly in night-vision mode.

It's also easy to set up -- download the Arlo app on your Android or iOS device of choice and follow the step-by-step instructions to get started. And, like Nest Cam -- a similar 1080p live streaming security camera with motion and sound alerts -- the Arlo Q has a magnetic base that can snap to any magnet-friendly surface.

I reconnected the office Nest Cam to compare the two cameras side-by-side. Hardware-wise, the Arlo Q is larger and lighter and doesn't feel quite as durable as Nest Cam. It also isn't as easy to maneuver and angle.

On the software side of things, both apps have similar functionality, but Nest's version is easier to navigate. There are two significant caveats, though. The Arlo Q sends motion and sound alerts on demand, as soon as an event takes place and it offers free 7-day event-based cloud storage (it also has an optional paid service if you're interested in continuous video recording).

Nest Cam records clips of motion and sound alerts on demand, but will only send one alert every 30 minutes, potentially creating a scenario where you don't get a notification during a burglary or other security event. Instead, you would have to be actively checking your activity log to see motion or sound events the moment they take place. Nest also doesn't offer event-based cloud storage (either free or paid), so you have to pay a minimum of $10 per month for any server-based recording and storage.

App and hardware design aside, the Arlo Q's main downside is its lack of third-party integrations. Netgear doesn't currently have an IFTTT channel or work with any devices from other manufacturers. You also can't be logged into the Web and mobile app on the same account at the same time, which isn't terribly inconvenient, but seems unnecessary since you can do this with Nest Cam (or any Nest product).

Netgear's $220/£170/AU$349 Arlo Q has some design downsides when it comes to its hardware and app and I wish it worked with more devices, but its alert functionality, free cloud storage and Nest-Cam-level specs make the Arlo Q highly recommendable, even holding its own alongside DIY security staples like Nest Cam."
Kidde RemoteLync Monitor review:|"

The $100 Kidde RemoteLync Monitor promises to do one thing: it'll listen for the alarms of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and will send a push notification to your phone should they sound. You'll use the iOS or Android app to connect it to your Wi-Fi network, then it'll spend the rest of its 10 year life trying hard to be a good listener.

It succeeds if the sounding smoke detector is close enough, but don't expect it to cover your whole home if you have multiple floors. You can purchase the US-only Kidde RemoteLync Monitor now for $100 from the company's site, Amazon and Home Depot. Aside from an overlong setup process, it works well enough if you find it at a discount, but the Kidde Monitor doesn't do enough or hear far enough to be worth the $100 price.

I plugged the Kidde RemoteLync Monitor into a hallway outlet of the CNET Smart Home. When I set off a smoke detector from that hallway or an adjacent room, I'd reliably get a push notification within 20 to 30 seconds. That's a fine turnaround time, albeit not exceptional.

Still, it was responsive. Even when I shut the door of the adjacent bedroom, the push notification came through with the same moderate punctuality. In a room at the other end of the hallway, the notification sometimes took 40 seconds to arrive, but were still reliable. Once I moved upstairs, though, I had to have a clear line of sight for the RemoteLync Monitor to work. After I shut a single door or rounded a corner, the Monitor became sporadic at best and deaf most of the time.

The limited range of the Monitor wouldn't be a problem if Kidde's device was one of a kind, or if it was priced in line with it's capabilities. The $100 Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight and the upcoming $60 Mydlink Smart Alarm Detector do the exact same thing. Though, RemoteLync helps its case with interoperability.

The IFTTT channel allows you to use the Monitor's triggers to talk to your larger smart home. You can flash your Philips Hue bulbs red when the Monitor hears an alarm, for example. The RemoteLync device also works directly with the $200 Kidde RemoteLync Security Camera. If you have the latter, it will automatically record when the Monitor kicks into action.

All of that is more than enough to make the Kidde RemoteLync Monitor recommendable on its own merits. It's just not recommendable based on value. The $100 iSmartAlarm Spot listens for smoke and CO alarms, and packs in a motion sensing camera. Basically, it does everything that both RemoteLync devices do together. Everybody likes a good listener, but I recommend going with a multitalented smart gadget like the iSmartAlarm Spot over this one-trick device."
Kidde RemoteLync review:|"

Kidde (pronounced kid-duh) is a well-known name in the United States for its array of smoke- and carbon monoxide-detecting devices. But the brand recently expanded its product roster to include RemoteLync, a $189 DIY indoor security camera that's on sale now in the US and slated for international availability in about a year.

So many brands are introducing Nest Cam-esque models to the market nowadays -- you know, plug-in HD live-streaming cameras complete with motion and sound alerts as well as opt-in monthly cloud storage for a fee  -- but Kidde veered off the beaten path a bit with its camera.

RemoteLync is equipped with a low-power rechargeable battery designed to last for roughly 3 months on a single charge. It doesn't have live streaming, and instead of 720 or 1080p video, Kidde's model has only standard-def 640x480 VGA resolution; you also won't find any audio alerts or two-way talk functionality on its specs sheet. (These trade-offs help ensure longer battery life.)

And Kidde makes up for those missing features with solid geofencing, an IFTTT channel, responsive motion alerts and a loud intruder-scaring siren. The price is a touch steep for this camera, but I'd recommend the RemoteLync to anyone more interested in security features than webcam functionality.

Kidde's RemoteLync cam is small and portable and snaps onto the included flat magnetic base with ease. That makes it simple to stick on a flat surface, but you can just as easily peel off the sticky adhesive strip on the bottom of the base and attach it to a wall.

The RemoteLync also comes with a cheaper-feeling plastic attachment that looks like a miniature helmet. It's supposed to act as a camera cover in case you have video-viewing privacy concerns, but you do have to open and close it manually.

Once you've completed the initial camera set up in the related Android or iOS RemoteLync app -- this process is very straightforward -- you can start playing around with various features.

Beyond being able to arm and disarm the camera manually from the app, you can also enable the geofencing feature, which sets the camera to either Arm or Disarm mode based on the location of your phone.  The downside, of course, is that the app is tracking your location at all times, but I found this feature to work extremely well. Geofencing is a neat tool -- when it works well -- because it allows for a level of Home/Away customization that you could never get with a static Home/Away schedule; you just have to remember to bring your phone with you when you leave.

You can also create recipes in IFTTT. I tried one that successfully armed the RemoteLync camera whenever the Nest thermostat (another IFTTT partner) was set to Away mode.

If the camera detects motion in Away mode, you can opt-in to receive push and/or email notifications and sound the built-in siren. It will record a short video clip of the action, too (you can adjust the clip length from 5 to 30 seconds, and you get 12 hours of cloud storage for free). This also worked very well, although the 5-second clips tended to miss some of the action.

This camera also works with other Kidde products, so I tested it alongside the RemoteLync Monitor that my colleague Andrew Gebhart reviewed simultaneously. The RemoteLync Monitor is a plug-in Wi-Fi gizmo that listens for smoke and/or carbon monoxide (CO) alarms and sends you a related alert, basically turning a standard non-smart detector into a connected version a la the Nest Protect.

With both Kidde RemoteLync devices connected at the CNET Smart Home, the camera automatically recorded a 5-second video clip whenever the smoke/CO-alarm-sensing Monitor issued an alert -- a neat extra if you have both Kidde products.

I like this camera overall, but it's essentially identical to Homeboy. When I reviewed Homeboy in 2014, it cost $150. Since then, the startup upped the price to $189 and it looks like Kidde's newer RemoteLync version followed suit. $189 is certainly a competitive price given today's DIY landscape, but it does seem a little high for a camera without live streaming or even HD recording/playback.

Still, Kidde's RemoteLync Home Security Camera is a solid option, particularly if you don't care about live streaming or high-definition and want something portable that can work in concert with other Kidde devices."
Light gets titillating with Tittle's connected LEDs|"

""Connected color-changing LEDs."" I must have typed those words a thousand times in the years I've spent writing about the smart home. And yet the Tittle Light, an app-controlled, color-changing LED smart lamp seeking funds on Indiegogo, managed to catch my attention.

It isn't just the dumb name. The -- sigh -- Tittle looks legitimately high-end, at least as smart home lighting novelties go. And, though it'll retail for much more, the crowd-funding campaign's early-bird discount puts it at $199, which converts to about £135 or AU$275. To put it in perspective, that's the same price as a three-bulb Philips Hue starter kit. I can see how an all-in-one fixture with high-class design could sway people away from the bulb-by-bulb approach.

Of course, the Tittle isn't aiming for the same sort of practical lighting that you'd get with a set of smart bulbs. Instead it embraces the novelty of color-changing light, seeking to serve as a decorative centerpiece for your smart home. And from the looks of it, Tittle does a decent job. With 512 LEDs packed inside an attractive smoked glass enclosure that sits atop an aluminum base, it looks like something Nikola Tesla might have whipped up on a whim. It's a connected conversation starter.

Beyond the colors and cool look of the thing, Tittle features a microphone that'll sync lighting changes to whatever music you're playing. As for connectivity, Tittle uses a Wi-Fi radio to sync with your computer or your Android or iOS device. Aside from changing the colors, you can switch it between digital and analog clock readouts, or ""paint"" your own custom color patterns and animations.

You'll also be able to dial up an animated emoji pattern from one of a handful of options in the Tittle app. Or, if you want something specific or are just feeling artistic, you can design your own, then save it to the cloud to share with friends.

As with all crowdfunding efforts, there's room for skepticism here. Spin-R, the startup responsible for Tittle, has focused solely on making high-end watch-winding devices until now, so the move to an LED novelty fixture is a bit out of left field. Still, Spin-R has brought high-end products to market before, and it brought working Tittle prototypes to CES last month, too.

Tittle estimates it'll ship units out to backers in September of this year. We'll keep an eye on the campaign and, fingers crossed, plan to test the lamp out this fall."
Honeywell Lyric Thermostat (Second Generation) review:|"

I reviewed Honeywell's original Lyric thermostat in July 2014. A direct response to startup Nest's (now Google's/Alphabet's Nest) round Learning thermostat (now in its third iteration), the Lyric boasted a familiar, Nest-esque hardware design, as well as Wi-Fi connectivity and a related Android and iOS app for on-the-go access.

Honeywell's version didn't work all that well. Rather than relying on an algorithm to adjust the heat and A/C like the Nest, the Lyric used geofencing tied to the location of your phone. (You set a radius and when your phone leaves that area, your thermostat should automatically switch to Away mode and back to Home mode when you return -- this only works if you create related rules in the Shortcuts section of the app). This was glitchy at best.

Unfortunately, the same is true of the brand's second-generation $250 Lyric thermostat.

Unlike the original Lyric, which only let you set either a quarter-mile or a 7-mile radius, the Lyric 2.0 lets you customize the range. So, I set the smallest possible range, roughly a quarter of a mile and drove well beyond the threshold several different times with two Lyric-connected phones in tow.

Sometimes, nothing happened. Other times, one of the two phones sent a push alert. Occasionally, both worked as expected, but not often enough to have confidence in its overall performance. (Note: After additional long-term testing, the geofencing functionality did improve somewhat, but still wasn't reliable enough to warrant an overall change to the Lyric's performance score.)

Honeywell's latest Lyric also adds Apple's HomeKit platform into the mix, so you can use Siri to control your thermostat both on your local Wi-Fi network and remotely (if you have a third-generation Apple TV or newer).

This is a neat feature in theory because it allows for voice control access straight from your phone, but HomeKit is finicky both to configure and to use. Honeywell incorporates the HomeKit pairing process into the initial setup -- and that's fairly straightforward, but the Apple side of things -- confirming iCloud account information, ensuring that you've enabled all of the correct settings and getting remote access to work through the Apple TV proved challenging.

That isn't unique to Honeywell, but it still doesn't bode well for users. And, the feature won't be useful to folks with Android devices at all.

And while Honeywell did make some in-app design updates, everything else still functions pretty much the same. You can still set rules, or ""Shortcuts"" in the app that adjust the heat, A/C and other functions on a schedule, but there's nothing revolutionary here that really changes the overall usability for the better.

Given the underwhelming performance -- and the potential for serious usability headaches with geofencing and HomeKit, I'd look to the Nest, the Ecobee3 (for a fellow HomeKit-compatible model) -- or even Honeywell's Wi-Fi Smart thermostats before considering Honeywell's Lyric 2.0."
Lutron Serena Remote Controlled Shades review:|"

Automated shades can be a cool feature for any living space, but when you start looking at the market, you might be surprised how expensive outfitting a whole home can be. That said, smart shades and blinds have a lot of potential. They can make windows in hard-to-reach places more accessible, and can be important tools for the disabled or elderly.

Lutron's Serena Remote Controlled Shades can't solve the price problem (each unit costing around $350 at the least, plus $150 for the Caseta Bridge that integrates with Apple HomeKit). But their hefty price tag makes a little more sense than what you'll pay for other smart shades. Not only do they boast features like Siri voice control and geofencing-based automation, they also integrate with plenty of other smart home gadgets, like thermostats and lights.

Despite the pricing and a few performance hiccups, those who need smart shades for a few vaulted windows or a particular bedroom will find a helpful solution in Serena.

Serena Shades are pretty easy to set up. With a power drill and a couple screwdrivers, I was able to set it up within 30 minutes. Add in the 15-minute setup of the Lutron Caseta Smart Bridge, the 10 minutes for the app and the five minutes for the remote, and the whole thing can be up and running in about an hour.

The good news is, besides the Caseta Bridge, you'll only have to buy shades. No extra hubs, no extra remotes. In fact, the only reason you need the bridge is to cut down on battery usage, since Apple HomeKit -- the home integration system Serena uses -- relies on Wi-Fi, which drains batteries fast. So your mobile app communicates with the plugged-in Caseta Bridge, which in turn communicates with the Serena Shades using a low-energy communication protocol.

Once everything is set up, using the Lutron app to control the Shades is a breeze. You can set timed scenes, use Siri voice control, automate commands with Geofencing, and integrate with other smart home gadgets. Here's how each feature stacked up.

Scenes: These are simple to set up in the app, but too basic in their capabilities. Setting your shades to open or close at certain times is nice, and the astronomic time clock even lets you personalize your scenes based on when the sun rises and sets where you live. The problem is, these scenes can't be triggered by anything except time. So you can't set the cellular shades to close and conserve heat if the thermostat's temperature is drifting too low. The only way to use triggers like these would be through IFTTT or Elgato, compatible third-party apps.

Siri: Voice control is one of the biggest appeals to Apple HomeKit. The problem is, Siri is still incredibly finicky. I ended up having to rename my shades because she never understood and responded to ""left shade"" ""middle shade"" or ""right shade."" Plus, despite the name, Lutron's ""Scenes"" don't equal HomeKit's ""Scenes."" That means you can't activate scenes from the Lutron app using Siri.

HomeKit: Serena works with Apple HomeKit, the integration system that uses your Wi-Fi and requires no extra hubs. This partnership works well. To integrate your shades with other gadgets, you just need a router and an iPhone or iPad. Unlike Somfy Motorized Blinds, no expensive whole-home automation system like Savant (or even more affordable system like Lowe's Iris) is necessary.

Integration: Once you have the $150 Caseta Bridge -- which falls between comparable bridges from Somfy ($200) and Philips Hue ($60) -- the Lutron app will let you integrate with Lutron products, select Honeywell thermostats, the Nest Learning Thermostat, certain Logitech gadgets and compatible HomeKit products. While this list isn't the most impressive lineup of smart home devices, Serena works with more products than any other smart shades I've seen.

Geofencing: This GPS-based solution is one way developers have tried to automate smart home tech. Usually using GPS to determine whether users are home or not isn't very reliable. Surprisingly, Lutron's app tracks you effectively -- though with occasional delays -- and can operate your shades based on whether you're leaving home or coming back.

Design: Lutron's Serena design is really clever. First off, you don't need anything extra to install the shades -- they work exactly like dumb shades. Second, the batteries are housed inside the body of the product, unlike others, such as Somfy Motorized Shades. Third, when you need to replace the batteries (which should last between 2 and 4 years, depending on the size and model), you can simply push the plastic tabs suspending the shade, and the body will swivel down and allow you to access the batteries without unlatching the whole thing. The motors are also quiet and smooth, and the response to commands, whether issued by remote or through the app, is consistently quick.

Although the price is too high for most consumers to comfortably afford multiple Serena Remote Controllable Shades, the product is pretty sharp. App control is intuitive, the interface is feature-rich, and the HomeKit integration makes the product's future promising. But until they become more affordable and some of the technical performance errors are rectified (particularly with Siri integration) I can only recommend them for particular needs, like vaulted windows or a specific room."
Orison claims to store your electricity, save it for later|"

Orison is a San Diego-based startup with a pretty lofty goal -- it's trying to reduce your overall reliance on the energy grid.

Its flagship products, the Orison Panel ($1,200, £835, AU$1,700) and the Orison Tower ($1,550, £1,100, AU$2,200), are two Wi-Fi-enabled plug-in devices that can supposedly store up to 2.2 kilowatt hours (kWh) of energy at a time. For reference, Orison says many of today's fridges use roughly 1 kWh per day. That means one Panel or Tower could theoretically power your refrigerator for a couple of days -- a huge benefit if you're dealing with a power outage.

The idea is that you plug either a Panel or a Tower into an outlet in your home -- it's mostly a design choice whether you opt for a Panel or a Tower, since they offer the same energy storage capabilities, although Towers come with built-in speakers for added functionality and a slightly higher price. Then, the unit should automatically start to talk to the team's cloud server and make choices about when to charge based on things like utility rates, peak demand charges, weather and blackouts.

You are also supposed to be able to use the related app to customize your settings and get the latest information on weather-related grid outages and more.

Once your unit has stored up all that energy, you can decide when and how to use it. One unit doesn't store enough kWh's to power your entire home. Instead, your Panel/Tower will be able to power just one circuit -- whichever circuit it's connected to when you begin to discharge it. You can also buy multiple units to take care of all of the various circuits in your home, but that can get pretty costly pretty quick.

Orison recently launched a Kickstarter campaign for its Panels and Towers, but the team has already raised over $110,000 -- that's more than double its original funding goal (and it still has 44 days to go). Prices start at $1,200, £835, AU$1,700 for one Panel and $1,550, £1,100, AU$2,200 for one Tower and Orison plans to start shipping units worldwide this August.

Orison offers a handy calculator that's supposed to estimate potential energy savings over time, as well as how many Panels or Towers you'd need to tackle energy storage for your whole home. I entered in my info and it said I'd need five units for my apartment. $6,000 is a lot of money to spend upfront to keep my small place powered, but I suppose it's the long-term calculations in savings that matter most."
Can Qube finally deliver an affordable, color-changing smart bulb?|"

Color-changing smart bulbs are a fun novelty for the connected home, but the good ones still cost too much. Enter Qube, a San Francisco-based startup fresh off of a highly successful Indiegogo campaign. Qube's pitch: a Wi-Fi connected color-changer that's brighter than Philips Hue -- for just $19 per bulb (about £13, or AU$27).

That's less than a third of the per-bulb cost of Philips Hue and other options, like the Lifx Color 1000, too. Like those Lifx bulbs, the Qube LEDs connect directly to your home network via Wi-Fi. That means you can use each bulb as soon as you screw it in, no bridges or hubs necessary.

Another similarity with Lifx: an emphasis on brightness. Qube promises that each bulb will put out 1,000 lumens at max brightness, well above the 800 lumens you'd expect from a 60W replacement LED, and significantly more than the 734 lumens offered by the latest Hue bulbs.

Qube gets you that brightness from a stated power draw of 11.5 watts (by comparison, the Lifx Color 1000 puts out 1,014 lumens from a power draw of 11 watts). That's a good number, and one that I'll look forward to testing out in our lighting lab.

On the app front, Qube promises iOS, Android, and Windows compatibility along with support for the Apple Watch. Compatibility with Apple HomeKit, the set of smart home protocols programmed into Apple's mobile devices, is also a possibility -- Qube says it's already applied for MFi certification. If it happens, that would allow you to turn your lights on and off, dim them up and down, or change their color simply by asking Siri. A channel on the free online automation service IFTTT is also said to be in the works -- we saw that do wonders for Philips Hue and Lifx, so it would be a good move for Qube, too.

Also interesting: the bulb features Bluetooth in addition to the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi radio. Qube says you'll be able to trigger automated lighting changes whenever you enter or leave each bulb's Bluetooth range. That would allow your smart lights to ""follow"" you around the home, at least if it works -- in my experience, automations based on Bluetooth proximity have been hit and miss. We'll have to wait and see which category Qube falls into.

Markup in the color-changing smart bulb space has been borderline egregious for years now, with standard smart lights like the Cree Connected LED and the GE Link LED showing that it doesn't cost a fortune to pack a radio into a light bulb. A cheaper color-changer that works as well for smart home setups as bulbs like those is long overdue.

The question is whether or not Qube can deliver. We've seen plenty of other startups offer cheaper color-changers only to fizzle out, but with a crowdfunding campaign that netted more than five times its goal already under its belt, Qube looks to be off to a good start.

Qube is still accepting preorders through its Indiegogo site, and estimates that it'll begin shipping bulbs out worldwide this June, with bases and voltages for all parts of the globe. We'll keep an eye on it and aim to test one out as soon as we can get our hands on one."
Immedia Blink review:|"

The Blink security camera by startup Immedia launched on Kickstarter back in July 2014, raising over $1 million -- a roughly 500 percent increase over its original $200,000 funding goal.

At that time, we hadn't seen many battery-powered models with free cloud storage, especially at such a reasonable price; one Blink cam plus the required plug-in Sync Module hub costs just $79/£55/AU$112 (the price will increase to $99/£69/AU$140 on February 1 and international shipping is scheduled to launch in the second quarter). It's been over a year since we first covered the Blink crowdfunding campaign, though, and many of its features aren't that unique anymore.

Cord-free, battery-reliant models like Netgear's Arlo and Homeboy are fairly common nowadays -- and an increasing number of brands are adding free cloud storage to their list of features. You'll also find a larger number of lower-priced DIY cameras available now, like Guardzilla, the Ezviz Mini and the iSmartAlarm Spot -- all of which cost $100 or less.

Blink is also missing a lot of other features, from two-way talk, to audio alerts, environmental sensors that alert you to changes in temperature, on-demand video recording, in-app rules and integration with products from other manufacturers either via IFTTT or another third-party service. And, while the Wi-Fi connection at the CNET Smart Home was solid during testing, the app was often laggy and said, ""System is busy, please wait.""

Immedia does have plans to add some of these options in the future, but Blink just doesn't offer enough to make it worthwhile today.

Blink is a small squarish camera with rounded edges that measures 2.77 inches by 2.77 inches. Out of the box, you get the camera, two lithium AA batteries, a separate stand that you have to attach yourself and mounting hardware. Most of the cameras I've reviewed come with preattached stands.

That means an extra step for you if you want to install your Blink camera in a fixed spot or simply position it to hit an optimal angle using the stand. And, you also don't have the added benefit of a magnetic base like Nest Cam, Netgear Arlo or the Ezviz Mini, which makes installation on any obliging magnetic surface a snap.

Blink also doesn't feel particularly durable. It isn't designed for outdoor use, so that isn't a concern, but it definitely has the look and feel of a plasticky smart-home hub or other bland accessory. And, removing the camera's back panel to replace the AA batteries isn't all that simple. The side of the camera has a sliding mechanism that makes it easier, but I still felt like I was going to break it every time I tried to open (or close) it.

The camera is equipped with a 720p 110-degree field of view lens, a motion sensor, an infrared LED for night vision and a Micro-USB slot, presumably to allow for future updates.

In addition to the camera itself, your purchase also includes a Sync Module. This required accessory is also a basic white plastic square that's a little smaller than the Blink cam at about 2 inches by 2 inches.

The Sync Module has an included power adapter and it performs a variety of functions -- it communicates with Blink's remote servers to avoid draining the Blink battery; it talks to the cameras via a low-power radio channel to ""wake them up"" whenever you want to pull up the live video stream; it has a a built-in USB port to facilitate future updates and it is an integral part of the initial setup and configuration process via the related Blink Android and iOS apps.

Instead of having to connect the Sync Module directly to your router, though, you can simply plug it in to any outlet and follow the instructions in the app -- create a username (using your email address) and password; open the confirmation email and verify your account; plug in the Sync Module; connect it to the Blink Wi-Fi network; connect to your local Wi-Fi network; install the included AA batteries in the camera and wait for it to connect.

It's a fairly straightforward process, although you will have to reconfigure both the Sync Module and your Blink camera any time you change your local Wi-Fi network. A slight inconvenience since you're dealing with two devices -- the Sync Module and the camera -- rather than just one.

The thing is, this camera doesn't do all that much. And in today's competitive DIY security landscape, that's  a pretty significant deal breaker. Cameras really need to offer something extra to stand out -- and Blink just doesn't.

Sure, it's battery-powered and it can detect motion, but that's about it as far as features. It performs pretty well overall, sending quick motion alerts whenever activity is detected, but it doesn't have any advanced video analytics that can tell the difference between a person, a pet or a shadow. To account for this, you can adjust the sensitivity of the sensor. This helps to some extent, but not much.

The battery-powered Homeboy camera works with IFTTT and has a built-in siren for true home security functionality. And, Netgear's battery-powered Arlo is rated for both indoor and outdoor use. What's more, if you're just looking for a simple, basic DIY camera for less money, the $70 Ezviz Mini and the $99 iSmartAlarm Spot offer more.

The Ezviz Mini has both local and free cloud storage, as well as a built-in magnetic base that makes installation very simple. iSmartAlarm's Spot has sound analytics that can detect the frequencies of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and send you an alert. Both also performed well.

Beyond Blink's limited features and only quasi-smart motion detection capabilities, I also had some issues with the app being laggy. At various times when I was trying to pull up the live feed, make changes in the settings section, and more, I would get a pop-up message saying that the server was busy. This happened enough over several days of testing in two different locations (both with solid Wi-Fi connections) that it impacted overall usability.

Blink also doesn't offer two-way talk, you can't record a video clip on-demand, there's no built-in siren, IFTTT channel or settings section where you can create advanced rules. Of course, it also costs less than your average DIY cam -- most sit around the $200 mark, but that isn't enough for me to recommend it.

Immedia says it's adding more features and functionality in the future, so I'll likely revisit Blink then, but it really isn't worth it right now."
First Alert OneLink Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm review:|"

What aggravates me most about the OneLink by First Alert Wi-Fi Smoke + CO Alarm is what it could have been. This is HomeKit's answer to the Nest Protect, and with its killer list of features, I honestly thought it had a good chance to become the smart smoke alarm to beat. It does everything the Protect does like push alerts, voiced warnings, and in-app silencing of false alarms. Plus, the $120 hard-wired version talks to your existing hardwired detectors, letting you smarten up your whole house with one unit and significantly lowering the barrier to entry for whole-home smart smoke detection.

Both the $110 battery-powered version and the $120 hardwired version have sealed batteries -- a backup in the case of the latter -- rated to last 10 years and thus meeting the requirements of certain states with stricter safety standards. First Alert also has a long history of making smoke alarms and safety gear, and that shows in the detector itself -- it consistently responded to smoke and blared its warning faster than the Nest Protect.

At some point, software updates and better HomeKit integration might make this the smoke detector I was hoping for. For now, a bare bones app, horrendously slow push notifications, and meaningless HomeKit functionality make First Alert's alarm a nonstarter as a smart-home product. The connected functionality just isn't good enough to be useful yet. Save yourself the money and get a non-connected $30 to $40 combination sensor, or if you want to get smart with smoke detection, go with the $100 second-gen Nest Protect, or the retrofit $35 Roost Smart Battery.

Before I faced the disappointment of the connected functionality, the OneLink by First Alert Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm made a great first impression on me. Again, the hardware here is solid and responsive. It looks great, and it's easy to set up.

Physically installing the device is almost the same as installing any other battery powered or hard-wired smoke alarm. You'll need enough basic DIY skill to hang it on a wall for the battery version, and you'll need to be comfortable connecting a couple of wires for the hard-wired model.

Both the iOS only app and a set of physical instructions walk you through installing either alarm type, and a separate mounting plate makes the whole process easier, as you can simply focus on hanging that plastic frame, and snap the main body of the smoke alarm into place once the back plate is properly hung where you want it.

Once you twist the alarm onto its mounted backing, the LEDs framing the alarm's central button will flash green, and the alarm will speak a welcome before the lights flash blue, indicating that it's ready to sync to your home's router.

The OneLink Alarm talks to your phone via Bluetooth, and sends you remote notifications over Wi-Fi. Once it's blinking blue, it'll use that Bluetooth connection on your phone to pull the appropriate Wi-Fi info. You'll barely have to do anything other than confirm the name of your network, wait for it to sync, then put in the proper Apple HomeKit ID.

As with any other HomeKit device, you can assign the alarm to a specific home, and then any of Apple's organizational buckets within your home, such as Zones and Rooms. You'll oddly assign the alarm to a specific room twice -- once for HomeKit organization with a name you can spell out yourself, and once from a selected list based on the names the alarm is programmed to say out loud.

When I first set up the alarm, I called the room the ""Smoke Test Room"" then had to dub it the ""Living Room"" for the sake of the audible alerts the alarm gives. To be fair, the alarm comes with several different room choice options, so you'll likely find a room name close to your selection, but I still found it slightly confusing to have the same alarm assigned to two different places in a single app.

Once you're up and running, you'll be able to test your alarm from the app and slide the brightness of the nightlight up or down. When the alarm sounds, it blares loudly and it's wildly annoying. I appreciated that. I certainly don't want my smoke detector to be shy if something's wrong. The central LEDs flash red and the alarm rings in a slightly different pattern if it's a smoke or CO emergency, and then a voice notification tells you which emergency it is, and where it is.

Here's where it reads the name you gave it from the listed choices, so my alarm would say, ""Evacuate, Evacuate, there's fire in the living room."" When testing, you'll see all of this in action, except the voice will clarify that it's testing, and then it'll go on to give you a reading of the parts per million of the carbon monoxide it sensed, before assuring you that the test is now over and you are protected. If the alarm is sounding for real, you'll see a button in the app letting you call 911.

You'll also see the battery percentage level in the app, and it'll let you know when it starts to run low. Since the batteries are sealed, you'll have to replace your detector at that point, which isn't great, but again, this was done to meet stringent safety standards in certain states including California. And it shouldn't happen for 10 years.

In the meantime, you can rest assured that once your alarm smells something wrong, it'll sound its siren loudly and proudly. The OneLink by First Alert Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm uses photoelectric smoke sensors that will supposedly catch both slow- and fast-moving fires while being less prone to nuisance alarms.

In our tests, those sensors proved reliably responsive, consistently picking up on the smoke candles we set off as soon or sooner than the Kidde smoke and CO detector we used for comparison. The second-gen Nest Protect would generally start sounding a few seconds after the Kidde alarm in the same test. As far as hardware is concerned, the OneLink Alarm performed slightly quicker than the Nest Protect.

It also looks fairly similar. That's not a bad thing; we loved the look of the Protect. The all-white First Alert alarm isn't quite as striking, but it's still attractive. And though it's a departure from the usual rounded shape of First Alert alarms, I didn't think the look too derivative of Nest. It's cut from the same cloth, and a small step down, but attractive all the same, and the white finish should blend into your ceiling more as the years go by and you stop thinking about your spiffy new smart smoke alarm.

You can purchase the OneLink by First Alert Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm now on Amazon and the Apple Store. Again, the hardwired model costs $120 (£80, AU$165) and the battery version is $110 (£75, AU$150).

For the price, you'll be getting a fine smoke alarm that makes a great first impression and has smarts and HomeKit compatibility. As it turns out, though, those latter two features don't add much to the experience.

Yes, you can use Siri -- the digital assistant on your iPhone -- to interact with the OneLink by First Alert Smoke + CO Alarm. That's the perk of the alarm working with HomeKit -- the smart-home software built into Apple's mobile operating system. The First Alert Alarm is the first smoke detector compatible with the HomeKit system, and in exchange for following Apple's structural and signal rules for HomeKit, First Alert gets a HomeKit sticker on their box, as well as automatic interoperability with any other HomeKit device.

It's a nice boon for both companies. It makes Apple's HomeKit catalog more diverse, and ups the profile of First Alert's product. As of now, it's not much of a benefit for consumers, since the HomeKit functionality is nearly useless. You absolutely can use Siri to check on the status of your smoke alarm, but doing so doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

Here are the commands currently at your disposal:

Other than the small convenience of being able to alter the brightness of the night light with your voice, I'm not sure how any of these commands are useful. Why would you ever ask your phone if your smoke alarm sensed something? It's the job of the smoke alarm to be proactive. If it senses something, it needs to let you know. If you need to ask if something's up, something went wrong in the communication process.

The Siri functionality on this OneLink Alarm is a feature for the sake of having a feature. And for now, this meaningless add-on is the only perk the OneLink alarm gets from HomeKit. Ideally, if the alarm sounds, it should be able to seamlessly interact with other HomeKit products to flash your Philips Hue bulbs red and unlock your Schlage deadbolt so you can get out of the house more quickly. The triggers for the OneLink Alarm that would allow this aren't ready yet, so you can't do any of this.

Unfortunately, the useless HomeKit integration is just one of the troubles this device has with smarts. If the push notifications and the app were at least reliably responsive, the OneLink alarm could have still been a viable product for HomeKit fans while waiting for the interoperability to develop. They aren't.

Once the alarm sounds, it consistently takes 90 seconds or more for the push notification to come through. Perhaps I'm spoiled a bit by the digital age, but 90 seconds is an eternity. And since this is a safety device, this isn't 90 seconds waiting for an Internet video to load. This is 90 seconds while your home is burning.

And that 90 seconds is the time quoted to me by a customer service specialist at First Alert. After our first couple of smoke candle tests produced no push notifications at all, I reached out because I thought I had a faulty product. As it turns out, we just weren't running long enough tests. Once we blew smoke at the alarm for 90 seconds straight or more, we finally began receiving push alerts and the alarm history in the app would update. Anything less, and the app wouldn't know anything happened.

For perspective, the Insurance Services Organization, or ISO, regulates the distribution of fire stations within a community with a goal of being able to reach all protected homes within 3.2 minutes. It takes First Alert half that time to send a message to your phone.

The sluggishness of the alerts make this OneLink Smoke Alarm a failure as a smart safety device. The Nest Protect's alerts weren't consistently instantaneous either, but they mostly came through within a few seconds. The alerts from the Roost Smart Battery consistently arrived within 1 to 10 seconds.

Not only are the push notifications slow, the app itself also seemingly takes forever to update to alarm status, so forget about using the silencing feature. You'll generally wait 30 to 90 seconds for the app to pick up on the fact that the alarm is sounding.

Then, you'll need to hold down the button to silence the alarm, then have to wait for another slow sync up before the alarm finally shuts down. Sometimes, the app will decide there's too much smoke to shut off, and will keep sounding despite your request for silence. I understand the reasoning for that override, but it proved quite annoying in practice.

All told, if you want to use the app to silence your alarm, expect to spend two to three minutes listening to it blare first, by which point you could have easily toweled away the smoke or gotten fed up enough to smash the thing into pieces with a hammer.

The app will catalog the history of your alarms -- a feature that didn't work at all on the second-gen Protect -- but again, only if the alarm is sounding for at least 90 seconds.

First Alert told me that the reason for the delay is the alarm prioritizes sending a signal to the other alarms in your house first. That seems a reasonable order of operations, as it's the people in the home whose lives are potentially in danger, and we indeed found that a second OneLink by First Alert Alarm would start sounding almost immediately after the first. The second alarm even spoke the correct room. So if I blew smoke at my connected ""Living Room"" alarm, the alarm I had set up for the ""Kitchen"" would still tell me that smoke was detected in the living room.

The hard-wired version of First Alert's smart alarm is also supposed to communicate with certain hard-wired dumb alarms. I loved the idea of this feature. Ideally, when my smart First Alert Alarm sounded, all other interconnected alarms would sound as well. And more importantly, when my dumb alarms sounded, I wanted my First Alert alarm to know, start it's own alarm, and send me a push notification. Unfortunately, as was the case with the rest of this alarm's smart features, the reality fell well short of the ideal.

We hard-wired a First Alert 9120 alarm next to the OneLink by First Alert Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm, with enough distance apart that we could direct smoke at one or the other without blowing it on both. Oddly, every time the smart OneLink Alarm sounded, the 9120 alarm would whir into action shortly after. This happened reliably, and always within a matter of seconds.

Going the other way -- sending the signal from the dumb alarm to the smart one -- wasn't nearly as reliable. It tended to take anywhere from 90 seconds to two full minutes of either blowing smoke at the dumb alarm or holding down the test button before the OneLink Wi-Fi Alarm would do anything. At that point, it would ring a couple of times, begin its vocal warning, then stop part way through its voice message, despite the fact that the dumb alarm was still ringing.

To be fair, we didn't expect the OneLink Alarm to know the correct room for the dumb alarm, but the fact that it stops sounding all together is problematic, and we never once got a push alert from the OneLink Alarm when prompting it via its dumb counterpart. The whole appeal of the feature -- adding smarts throughout your home with a single connected unit -- doesn't work.

Obviously, some signal is making it between the two alarms, but the OneLink Alarm doesn't know what to do with the signal it gets from a nonconnected unit. And this half-baked interconnectedness certainly isn't polished enough to excuse the extreme delays in push notifications.

Aside from the major gaps in functionality, the app itself is also shallow and lacks customization. You can't see or control any other HomeKit devices with it, as you can with a few HomeKit apps, and you can't even access any in depth options for the OneLink Alarm, such as scheduling when the nightlight should turn on. The app doesn't get the basics right since push notifications and silencing is so slow, and it doesn't have any advanced features. It's not completely broken, but that's as much as I can say about it.

Smarts on your smoke detector can help you in two ways. The connected functionality can increase your safety by letting you know something's wrong when you're away, allowing you to take action. It can also add convenience to your life by letting you silence an annoying false alarm more quickly, without having to wave a towel around or grab a broomstick to hit the silence button. Because of the poor response time of the app, the OneLink by First Alert Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm doesn't work in either sense.

The $100 second Gen Nest Protect does both well enough. I recommend that if you want a wholesale replacement, or the $35 Roost Smart Battery makes for an appealing retrofit option. It packs smarts into a familiar 9V battery and was quite responsive in our tests.

The nonconnected aspects of the OneLink by First Alert Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm work fine, and that alone makes it worth more than simple $20 smoke detectors. But combination smoke and CO alarms with voiced warnings can be had for $40 to $50, and OneLink's $110 to $120 HomeKit alarm doesn't add any useful functionality on top of those.

Control4's new entertainment automation system is a smart-home gateway drug|"

Control4 is best known for its whole-home automation services, but its newest offering is a single box that promises to smarten up your home's entertainment capabilities. The new Control4 EA Series (that's ""EA"" for ""entertainment and automation"") line of connected home controllers will range from $600 for a single-room setup to $2,000 for a unit powerful enough to smarten up a large home.

Each offering in the EA Series acts like a  hub for your home entertainment. The system is compatible with over 9,500 connected home products -- including entertainment devices ranging from Blu-ray players and gaming consoles to cable boxes and streaming gadgets such as Roku or Apple TV.

The EA Series pitch: control all of it -- along with your smart home gadgetry -- using a single remote and a single app. That means, for example, you'll be able to set your lights to dim automatically when you start watching a movie, then dim back up when you press pause or stop.

Music is another major point of focus for the EA Series. Each server features native support for a number of streaming services, including Pandora, TuneIn and Napster (Spotify is a notable omission). You can also stream music from your phone, tablet or external hard drive, including support for high-fidelity, lossless formats such as FLAC.

Control4 is also showcasing a feature called ""Shairbridge,"" which uses Apple's Airplay feature to stream music from any iOS device throughout customized zones in the home. The idea is that you'll be able to use AirPlay as you normally would, but stream your music to multiple rooms at once. The rub is that you'll need to upgrade past that $600 base model -- which only supports a single audio stream -- to take full advantage of it.

That $600/AU$995 model is called the EA-1. Next in the series is the EA-3, which supports three audio streams and costs $1,000/AU$1,995. Finally, there's the $2,000/AU$3,995 EA-5 which can wrangle -- you guessed it -- five audio streams at once. The EA-1 comes packaged with the SR-260, Control4's take on the universal home remote.

Control4 is distributing the EA series through its network of dealers. This means you'll need to have someone come out and hook everything up for you, and installation prices will vary. That might be a deal-breaker if you're looking to go the DIY route with your home setup, but Control4 pitches it as a plus, citing the comfort of having someone else get your smart home gear in line for you. Given ourgenerally positive experience testing out a dealer-installed connected home setup from AT&T at the CNET Smart Home, I'm inclined to agree that there's some appeal to Control4's approach.

Beyond that, there are no additional fees, although you will need to spend an extra $100 per year if you want to take advantage of app-enabled remote controls from beyond the home. Those probably aren't necessary if you're just looking to juice up your home entertainment capabilities, but if you want to tie your entertainment into the rest of your smart home, it might be a necessary splurge.

Control4's web of dealers extends worldwide. In the UK, the EA-1, EA-3, and EA-5 are priced at £400, £667, and £1,333, respectively."
Frigidaire Cool Connect uses app-linked smarts to chill hot homes|"

Imagine if you could link a series of wall-mounted air conditioners together and control them remotely through one smartphone app. In theory, you'd have a home cooling setup that rivals the comfort of a pricey centralized air system, for a fraction of the cost. The new Frigidaire $329 Gallery Gallery Cool Connect will conceivably bring these useful capabilities to the table.

Revamped and remodeled just in time for KBIS 2016, the appliance takes a page out of the now defunct Quirky + Aros by promising to roll futuristic looks, smart connectivity, plus support for multi-unit command and cooperation in one compact machine.

Very, according to Frigidaire. The company says it designed the Cool Connect to be sleek, even stylish, and occupy as little space as possible. To be clear, this product is not Frigidaire's first stab at a smart air conditioner. That contraption, also under the Cool Connect name, was essentially a stock wall-mounted model with Wi-Fi networking hardware slapped inside as an afterthought.

Physical controls on the new Cool Connect are kept to a minimum, with the only keys for controlling the appliance running along its trim top edge. The face of the Cool Connect is flat and bare as well, except for a bright LED which displays the current temperature setting in large digital numbers. In fact, most of the air conditioner's front consists of a monolithic mesh grate which makes the machine look more like a speaker than a typical AC unit.

What's unique about the Cool Connect, though, is its smart home chops. The air conditioner  communicates with Wi-Fi networks and the Frigidaire Smart Appliance mobile application (Android and iOS versions) allowing you to command the unit from anywhere your phone or tablet enjoys Internet access.

When connected, the Cool Connect can be programmed to operate on a schedule or ping you with friendly reminders for regular maintenance, like cleaning and swapping in fresh filters. The most compelling aspect of the appliance's smarts, however, is that you can link multiple Cool Connect units together and control them as a group. I imagine such an arrangement will come in handy for those living in old houses with several stories and no venting for a forced air climate control system. It's an equally compelling air conditioning workaround for cooling several apartment rooms at once.

One weakness in the Cool Connect's capabilities is its lack of support for third party platforms, such as IFTTT, Nest, and Apple HomeKit. Unless Frigidaire addresses this, integrating the Cool Connect into a wider universe of smart home gadgets is a non-starter.

Frigidaire expects the $329 Gallery Cool Connect to arrive in stores by spring of 2016, right before heatwave season."
ComfyLight is a security gadget posing as a light bulb|"

Startup Comfy is selling its smart light bulb ComfyLight, launching on Kickstarter today, primarily as a security gadget. How exactly can a light bulb keep your home secure? Three main ways, according to Comfy: the bulb houses a motion detector; it flashes if it detects a break-in; and it turns on and off throughout the day to mimic your normal routines, even when you're out of the house.

Most smart bulbs, such as those from LifX or Philips, can be remotely controlled or scheduled when you're out. But Comfy is aiming for a more reliable (and less involved) security setup -- one that automatically mimics light behavior when you're away so as to deter potential intruders.

Comfy isn't the first to do this. BeOn Bulbs, for instance, include similar software that replays learned lighting patterns when homeowners are away. BeOn even listens for your particular alarms and responds to them by flashing or turning on. BeOn's main problem is it foregoes the scheduling features of other smart bulbs. Luckily, Comfy doesn't fall into the same trap: you can schedule, toggle and dim your bulbs from the app.

ComfyLight's second big claim to fame is its motion detector. First off, the sensor will alert users with a push notification if something is amiss (such as movement when no one should be home). It will also automate the lights, so when you walk into a room, they'll flip on.

No smart bulbs have done this, but a few smart plugs have tried. Both the terrible Nyrius and the surprisingly precise Zuli use Bluetooth to track your presence and respond when you enter or exit a room. The difference is, Bluetooth can successfully gauge when you're in a room or just passing by. ComfyLight isn't using Bluetooth; it's using motion detection.

Right now, I'm skeptical. Using motion detection to automate lights could be really cool, but it could just as easily be annoying. If walking through your house flashes a series of lights on and off, for example, that's a problem. Motion detection can also go wrong on the level of sensitivity, as demonstrated by the otherwise impressive Ezviz Mini drop-cam. Eventually, we just turned its motion detection off, because it was sending us push notifications for every shifting shadow.

Although I like the idea of light automation, I never want my lights to misbehave. That's the tough balance Comfy hopes to strike with its bulbs -- convenience without annoyance.

Looking at some of ComfyLight's features, it might be up to the challenge. One such feature is the ""away"" reminder: When your phone disconnects from your Wi-Fi as you exit the house, ComfyLight's app will remind you to activate the security mode. Similarly, when your phone reconnects to the Wi-Fi, the security mode will automatically disengage.

If these bulbs really can perform all their smart features well, and introduce these new security options successfully, then the ComfyLight could be a great product. But to be worth its whopping price tag of $140 per bulb (that's about £100 or AU$200), it'll have to be terrific."
Zmodo Pivot review:|"

The $150 indoor Zmodo Pivot cam was first unveiled at CES earlier this year. Zmodo isn't new to the security camera scene, but it did something entirely different with this model. It's equipped with motion sensors that cover 360 degrees and a pannable center that auto-rotates to record activity clips outside of the 135-degree camera's otherwise fixed range.

The Pivot also has night vision, two-way audio, a Bluetooth speaker, 16GB of internal storage, and temperature and humidity sensors. It comes with two battery-powered door/window sensors, too, and you can add on Zmodo's $150 Greet doorbell camera and other brand-specific accessories as needed.

While it occasionally feels like this camera is trying to do too much, the 360-degree motion sensors, panning function, and included door/window accessories definitely add value. Its 1080p live stream, night vision, and other standard features are also solid, although the motion detection was a bit hit or miss.

Consider the Pivot over other DIY camera options if you want to cover a wide field of view and don't care about third-party smart-home integrations (because this camera doesn't have any).

Cameras that can pan and tilt have been around for a while now; we've even reviewed some of them. But, cameras surrounded by a whole bunch of motion sensors aren't all that common among DIY pan-and-tilt units -- and they are completely MIA when it comes to single, fixed-view security cameras like Nest Cam, Samsung's SmartCam HD Plus, ArcSoft's Simplicam, iSmartAlarm's Spot and many more.

That's the main thing that sets the Pivot apart from the competition. Its sensors are located at the top of the camera and span its circumference to pick up on activity that's happening beyond the Pivot's 135-degree field of view. If someone's walking near the camera, but they don't actually pass in front of the camera lens, it doesn't matter. The built-in motion sensors issue an alert and the Pivot follows suit by, well, pivoting to capture a video clip of the activity. You can also pan manually if you're interested in seeing what's going on at home on demand.

You get two battery-powered door/window sensors with your purchase, too. Stick them in view of the camera and you can program it to rotate in the direction of the door/window/cabinet/drawer you're monitoring when the sensor detects activity.

In addition to its 360-degree motion sensors, door/window sensors, and panning capabilities, the Pivot cam also boasts some other solid specs:

It looks pretty nice, too. A smallish black cylinder that's similar to the Canary and to Amazon's Tap in terms of design, the Zmodo Pivot is fairly discreet. At the same time, it works best  in the center of a room due to its 360-degree panning, so you probably won't want to tuck it away in a corner.

A 1080p high-definition resolutionTemperature and humidity sensorsTwo-way talk via a built-in speaker and a microphone16GB internal storageNight visionBluetooth speakerRelated Android and iPhone apps

Configuration was as simple as downloading the Zmodo app, plugging in the Pivot camera, and entering the local Wi-Fi credentials. Adding the door/window sensors was also straightforward -- just select Add device > Accessories, then push the button on the side of the sensor for it to connect.

The app is mostly easy to navigate, but it isn't the most streamlined software I've ever seen. It always took a little longer than expected to find the various features and functions I wanted to access. Even so, it got easier after extended use.

But even with all of these features and options, the Pivot has a couple of significant limitations. Zmodo says it's bringing cloud storage into the mix ""soon,"" but it isn't available today. That's fine if you're partial to local control, as it has 16GB of internal storage, but it won't suit everyone.

It's also seriously lacking in terms of third-party integrations. It doesn't work with Amazon Alexa, Nest, Apple HomeKit, IFTTT, SmartThings, Wink, or any other smart home platforms or products. A Zmodo spokesperson also told me that, ""There are no future plans to integrate at the moment."" Again, that's fine if you aren't looking to expand the system, but it could be a deal breaker for some.

The Pivot performed well during my testing. The video didn't lag much, the live stream looked good in both day and night mode, the software auto-adjusted between SD and HD when the Wi-Fi network was slow and the notifications related to motion and any door/window activity were prompt.

But there are a couple of caveats. The Zmodo support page says, ""Pivot is designed to send you an alert no more than once every 10 minutes,"" so it won't capture every motion event by design. I also got a handful of phantom alerts when no obvious motion activity had taken place. Because of this, I wouldn't depend on it exclusively to secure your home.

The $150 Zmodo Pivot is a quirky camera. Its 360 degrees of motion sensors and pannability make it an asset for those times when you want to see an entire room at a glance. The addition of temperature and humidity sensors, as well as the Bluetooth speaker and two included door/window sensors may be secondary features, but they give the Pivot a unique suite of options that some might appreciate having. I do wish the Pivot had cloud services and worked with products from other manufacturers, but Zmodo's all-seeing Pivot would still add value to your smart home."
Two pieces of Flair allow for room-specific temperature control|"

Hoping to outdo Keen Home at localized temperature control, tech startup Flair will bring a more flexible and more budget-friendly option to the smart air conditioning field. Flair's $40 Smart Vent works with the $60 Flair Puck smart room controller to adjust the temp of the room you're in to your liking.

That's standard for the smart vent systems we've seen, including Keen Home, Ecovent and the Linq Home Smart Vent. Flair hopes to distinguish itself by working with your wider smart home, all major smart thermostats, and even non-central heating and cooling systems. The Flair Puck has an IR blaster, so you can use it to control some window air-conditioning units and mini-split heating and cooling systems.

Flair has an open API, so you can connect it to a variety of smart-home gear on your own if you have the know-how. At launch, it'll have the following integrations built-in:

Thermostats

Smart Home

You won't need the vents if you don't have a central heating and cooling system, obviously. The puck acts as the brain of the system either way, with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built-in as well as the IR blaster.

The puck uses geofencing with your phone and the Flair app for iOS and Android to set the temp accordingly when you come and go, and it uses the Bluetooth on your phone to know if you're in a particular room. This lets it go beyond mere home and away modes, with specific programs depending on who is where in your house.

That all sounds wonderful, but we've had trouble with geofencing before -- on the Quirky Aros window air conditioner for example -- so I'll have to see this room-by-room occupancy function well to believe it. It can also supposedly distinguish between different users and their preferences, but since it doesn't directly control the temp, just talks to the devices that do, I'd imagine it would have trouble being that precise with several different rooms and several different user preferences.

I'm certainly willing to be convinced, though, and all of Flair's promises sound great. I'm a little concerned about its responsiveness. By contrast, competitor Keen Home's vents are a recognized partner of Nest and on the Works with Nest product list. Flair's Smart Vents aren't there yet, they just use Nest's open API and communicate with Nest's cloud, the same way they'll communicate with any other smart product.

A Flair representative assured me the company is working toward Works with Nest certification, but until then, in the case of lost signal, the Puck will simplify things and do its best by talking directly to the vents.

The Flair rep also said one Vent will work just fine on its own for a room with a sensitive occupant. Replacing all of your vents would help the system be more robust, but I'd imagine you'd need a bunch of Pucks as well. At that point, the $100 total cost of one Vent plus one Puck per room could actually end up being more than Keen Home's system.

Keen Home's vents are $80 apiece, but have the temperature sensors built in. You need a $40 smart bridge, but only one for the whole house.

The Flair Puck stands out as a unique offering, and an easy way to help those without central systems to smarten up their home's temp. It also has microapps so you can control compatible smart home gear like your Philips Bulbs right from the dial on the Puck. And the Puck senses pressure, humidity and ambient light in addition to occupancy and temperature. But since it's central to the experience of the Vent, it dampens the cost-effective angle.

Whether the Puck helps Flair heat and cool more efficiently, we'll see. US presales on the company's site launch today, with the products shipping this spring. Flair will launch internationally later this year, with the US price for the Puck converting to approximately £45 and AU$90 for our readers in the UK and Australia respectively. The Vent price converts to around £30 and AU$60.

Somfy MyLink review:|"

Editors' note: This review has been updated to include more information for those who already own Somfy Motorized Shades, and are primarily interested in the MyLink hub.

You know that scene from ""Iron Man"" when the alarm goes off in Tony Stark's room, the opaque windows miraculously turn transparent, and suddenly revealed is a cliffside view of the Pacific Ocean? Who wouldn't want to get out of bed with a routine like that? That level of ""cool"" is what I hoped Somfy's smart window shades would achieve. But I was disappointed.

After getting the Somfy Motorized Shades set up, and the Somfy MyLink hub, which enables iOS or Android app control, I spent a few days testing out what they could do. Using a remote, you can command the shades to go up or down, or somewhere in between, and you can use your phone to schedule their behavior and create more complex scenes. But that's it. They don't integrate with many smart-home gadgets, they don't monitor or respond to sun location -- these blinds just don't feel that smart. And I wouldn't feel very smart either, paying between $300 and $400 per window shade, plus $200 for the MyLink hub.

For customers who already have Somfy Motorized Shades, though, the MyLink could be a decent purchase. Somfy allows many other shade and blind designers to incorporate the proprietary motors into their designs. So if you already have a few Somfy motors around the house, $200 isn't too steep a price to pay for app control. The problem is, for anyone trying to decide which smart shade company to buy into for the future, Somfy just isn't showing enough potential right now to justify the price.

I spent a day installing Somfy's Motorized Blinds, pairing them with channels on the remote, and setting up the MyLink hub, and didn't run into too many problems. Of course, as with any blinds, there's the process of removing the previous installations and positioning the new ones -- all the while fumbling with measuring tape, a hammer, a power drill, a level and dozens of tiny screws. But that's par for the course.

The only difficulty beyond the usual woes of home installation was finding room for the newly necessary battery tube (a wired version is also available). The battery tube, which houses eight AA batteries, connects with a short wire to the Somfy motor and powers it. If you are installing the shades in a recessed window, the inside casing is usually deep enough to install the shade. But at the Smart Home there wasn't room for the battery tube's moorings without screwing into the window sash.

I ended up using double-sided tape, which worked well. But I was disappointed in the need for a separate battery device rather than a slot for batteries in the shade itself.

Once I installed the shades themselves, I had to program the Telis RTS (Radio Technology Somfy) Remote to communicate with the shades properly. Though this should've been relatively simple, it actually ended up feeling like a complicated math problem.

The remote features five channels, each of which can connect to a single shade or group of shades. The shade(s) on a given channel can then be told to go ""Up,"" ""Down"" or to a personalized ""My"" location. The problem is, when you're setting up the channels, you can only copy and paste the content of one channel to another. If channel 1 connects to two shades, for instance, you can only copy both shades to channel 2 at the same time. The only way to copy and paste individual shades is by unplugging all the other shades while performing the task, and then going back and individually clearing the original channels (unplugging more shades).

If you had a hard time following all that, then you're starting to understand the mental exercise setting up the channels turned out to be. While Somfy recommends professional installation (which would bypass some of these frustrations), many shade and blind companies will not offer such services fee-free. It would be nice to see a setup process that's a little more accessible for customers who elect to install their window dressings themselves.

The good news is, when you finally connect the MyLink hub to your phone, and in turn connect your phone to the Somfy shades, the process is a breeze by comparison. Using the Somfy system ends up feeling easy and intuitive.

Somfy's biggest selling point isn't the remote control, but the ability to set and schedule scenes. And in that regard, the Somfy MyLink hub is pretty effective. The app interface is simple and intuitive, and setting up timing and commands is as easy the first time as it is the hundredth. You can even make your blinds open or close based on when the sun rises or sets. Although the RTS Remote occasionally failed to connect for a few seconds, I had no problems with my phone, and the schedules ran whether I was connected to the home Wi-Fi at the time or not.

Clever design only partly explains the app's simplicity: the features are just sparse. Sure, you can set the shades to open each morning at sunrise, but there's no sun monitoring and blind-adjusting to account for the angle of sunlight. There's no temperature sensing and blind-angling to account for, say, heat loss during a cold evening. There's very little smarts to actually speak of, other than the basic scheduling. In fact, the MyLink app doesn't even include triggers of any sort.

That brings me to the other disappointment of Somfy's technology: the lack of integration. Only if you pay an extra $100 you can get an RTS to Z-Wave Bridge -- a device that translates the proprietary communication protocol of Somfy into a radio frequency understood by many other smart-home gadgets. Then the shades are compatible with systems like Lowe's Iris, Wink, Crestron, Control4 and Savant. But without Wi-Fi or Bluetooth functionality built into the shades or the MyLink hub, casual users who don't want to invest in additional hubs or smart tech won't get any integration benefits.

Right now, Somfy is one of a small few companies investing in motorized blinds. Many other window shade companies offer them, but they often are attaching their own fabrics to Somfy's motors. That said, a few developers have begun to offer competition. Lutron's Serena Motorized Shades are Homekit compatible, but they cost at least as much per shade as Somfy's. Smart windows -- like the ones in ""Iron Man"" that change from opaque to transparent -- are still in development, though a few companies like InvisiShade are beginning to package them for consumers.

Customers looking for more affordable alternatives have turned to places like Indiegogo for solutions. Smart Shades and Teptron Move are both cool ideas that could be feasible for a larger base of customers, but with their lower prices come some limitations to functionality.

If you want the kind of morning routine that Iron Man has, it seems like you're going to have to wait. Although smart window shades are on the minds of developers and consumers, the prices right now are just too high. To outfit the ground floor of the CNET Smart Home (20+ windows) with the particular shades we used, plus the MyLink hub, would cost upward of $7,000.

And really, that seems like the pattern for Somfy's technology: the basics are solid, but each new feature requires a new expensive device. A basic Somfy motor costs on average $270. Depending on the shade or blinds your attach, the price will jump another $25-$300. If you want to set scheduled scenes with your phone, you'll have to dish out another $200 for the MyLink hub. Want Z-Wave integration? You'll have to drop $100 for another bridging hub. And so on, with plenty of other remotes and switches that each offer one or two clever upgrades at high prices.

Ultimately, smart blinds would be one of the coolest home gadgets to have, but until Somfy adds more smarts to their system or drops the price, I can't recommend the MyLink unless you already happen to have Somfy blinds."
Grid Connect ConnectSense Smart Outlet review:|"

I get a kick out of saying ""good morning"" to my iPhone, and watching my HomeKit lights, locks and fans respond simultaneously according to my wishes. The $80 Grid Connect ConnectSense Smart Outlet plays along with the Siri-controlled smart home software baked into iOS 8 and iOS 9. Stick the device into one of your outlets, use the intuitive app to connect the plug to your home's Wi-Fi -- it walks you through every step of the 2-minute process -- and then you can plug any two dumb devices you'd like to smarten into the outlets.

Siri can control the two smart ConnectSense outlets together or separately, just make sure you assign them names you can remember. Both the app and the Siri controls work consistently well. You can purchase the ConnectSense outlet now on the company's site or Amazon.com. Grid Connect hopes to bring it overseas soon, where the $80 US price converts to approximately £55 and AU$115.

The ConnectSense app deserves particular praise, as it lets you control all of your HomeKit devices, not just Grid Connect's, and makes it easy to group them into HomeKit's organizational buckets such as rooms and zones. I dismissed the app when discussing all HomeKit apps back in November, but the Grid Connect team obviously worked on it a lot since then. It's simple to create that ""good morning"" scene with the app, enabling many devices to respond to a single command. It even allows triggers, letting you set timers or ""If this, then that""-style rules for your HomeKit devices.

The outlet also has a nightlight, Bluetooth, and a USB charging port, but that's it. The $40 iHome iSP5 works with Android; the $60 iDevices Switch includes energy monitoring. The ConnectSense doesn't do either, so I recommend the iDevices plug over it, at least until ConnectSense unleashes its own energy monitoring. According to the company, that feature is built into the hardware, just not ready on the software side.

Right now, the ConnectSense Outlet is a solid smart outlet, especially if you have a couple of devices in close proximity that you want to automate separately. I enjoy the HomeKit functionality it offers, but the best part of ConnectSense -- the app -- is free and useful whether or not you buy the plug. The plug joins HomeKit's growing bag of interconnected tricks, but doesn't stand out from the rest."
GE 40W Replacement Vintage-Style Filament LED review:|"

Incandescent light bulbs have largely been phased out in favor more efficient fluorescent and LED options, but there's plenty of lingering nostalgia for the bulbs of yesterday as well as plenty of design applications for that golden glow of a filament.

Enter the filament LED, an emerging trend where LED light bulbs arrange their light-emitting diodes in a way that mimics the look of the classic tungsten filament in an incandescent light bulb. So far, these bulbs have mostly come from smaller manufacturers looking to stand out, but now GE is in the game too, with a new 40W replacement ""Vintage-Style"" filament LED of its own that sells in a $20 two-pack at Sam's Club stores.

Vintage is the right word for it. In addition to the faux-filaments, you get a classic-styled elongated shape, a candle-like 2,316 Kelvin (K) glow and a subtle sepia tint to the glass. It's a design that does a good job of bringing back a classic aesthetic, and if that's what you're going for, I think you'll be pleased with what you get. But if you're looking for the smooth dimmability of old school incandescents, look elsewhere -- this bulb flickered on every switch I tested it on.

GE's filament-style LED mimics the look of yore by arranging the light-emitting diodes into four vertical columns and suspending them in the center of the bulb using filament-esque wiring. It's a pretty simple trick, but one that works well to give the bulb a distinctive appearance.

Turn the LED on, and you'll see a warm, yellow glow that tilts toward the orange side of things, thanks to a faint sepia tint in the bulb's glass. GE pegs that color temperature at 2,400 K, but I clocked it even lower than that, at 2,316 K. The low color temperature fits the bulb and its faux-filament quite well, giving it a golden glow that works nicely with the overall aesthetic.

All of this is to say that if you're buying this bulb for its old-time appeal, you won't be disappointed. It'll definitely lend a vintage feel to an exposed bulb setup.

Of course, there's more to design than how the bulb itself looks. Let's start with brightness. With a light output of 440 lumens, GE pitches this bulb as a 40W replacement LED. The average 40W incandescent puts out about 490 lumens, so it's fractionally less bright than the bulbs it's aiming to replace, but still comfortably in the ballpark.

GE's bulb puts out those lumens out from a power draw of just 5 watts -- less than any of the other 40W replacements I've tested to date. What's more, that number might be a bit conservative, as in my lighting tests, the bulb's power draw came in even lower than stated.

That puts the bulb's efficiency right around 90 lumens per watt, which is, again, better than any of the other 40W replacements I've tested. Run the thing for an average of three hours per day, and it'll add just 60 cents to your energy bill each year. A 40W incandescent, on the other hand, would add about $5 to your bill.

At $10 per bulb, that gives GE's filament LED a payback period of about two and a half years, after which GE says it should continue to last for at least another decade. That's very good considering that the bulb comes with a five-year warranty, but keep in mind that other LEDs we like -- namely, the Osram 40W Replacement LED -- cost a little bit less. Many of those also boast considerably longer lifespans.

Something else to consider with regard to bulb design is the direction of its light output. GE's bulb puts out light in all directions, but it doesn't quite do so in even fashion -- you'll get more light up above the bulb than you will down below it. That's understandable to a point, as GE looks to have sacrificed a certain degree of omnidirectionality in favor of the bulb's vintage design. Just be aware that there are better bulbs to read beneath.

As said earlier, the numbers all add up for this bulb. It offers sufficient brightness for a 40W replacement, it boasts an appropriately warm color temperature and it's more efficient than other bulbs like it.

But numbers only tell you part of the story. Another key consideration is how well the bulb works with dimmer switches, something you can only see by plugging the thing in and adjusting it up and down on a variety of switches. Fortunately, that's exactly what we do with every dimmable light bulb that we test.

With GE's filament LED, the result wasn't great. The bulb flickered on all three of the switches we test with. Sometimes the flicker was subtle, sometimes it was significant. Other times, it would stop flickering and dim normally for a bit. At any rate, it was enough for me to tell you to flat-out avoid this bulb if you're planning on dimming the lights.

It's a shame, and kind of a surprising misstep, too. Part of the classic appeal of incandescents is that, typically, they dim really well, and look particularly striking when dimmed down low. To GE's credit, the filament LED gets the low-light part right -- the bulb dims cleanly down to zero percent, something none of the other 40W replacements I've tested can quite claim. But that doesn't matter if it's going to flicker badly along the way.

We've had better luck dimming other LEDs. The Osram bulb I mentioned earlier is particularly good on dimmer switches and would be a much, much better choice for anyone planning on dialing the light up and down.

The filament LED did a better job in our heat management tests, where we measure how much light each bulb loses due to heat, and how long it takes each bulb to hit its steady state, the point at which heat stops affecting brightness. Testing in one of our climate-controlled chambers, the bulb's 447 lumens was over 90 percent of the initial 490 lumens or so that we saw when we first turned it on. It also hits that 447-lumen steady state in about 40 minutes, well within the hour that we're looking for.

Granted, the bulb is probably a bit too big for a lot of enclosed fixtures, where solid heat management gets really important. Still, it's reassuring to see strong evidence that the hardware inside the bulb is sound.

As a design play, the GE Vintage-Style LED is a success. It's a good incandescent lookalike with some nice extra touches, like that elongated build and tinted glass. If you're looking for a little bit of classic lighting ambiance, it'll do the job nicely while helping to keep your power bill down at the same time. At $20 for a two-pack, it's a bit pricier than some of the new low-cost lighting options we've seen in the past year, including GE's own Bright Stik LED, but it isn't unreasonable.

The bulb is less successful from a practical perspective. Other 40W replacement LEDs offer better directionality, better dimming capabilities, and in some cases, a lower cost of entry. My favorite of those is the Osram 40W Replacement -- if you're just looking for a good bulb to throw under a lampshade, a bulb like that is a much better choice."
Smart utensil tracks your calories with each bite|"

I love food, and I'm a fast eater. So imagine my mixed feelings when I came across the Spün at CES 2016 in Las Vegas. This $75 smart utensil promises to count your calories with each bite and let you know if you need to slow down. This could be a dieter's dream or a foodie's nightmare -- do I really want to know how many calories I'm shoveling in with each forkful?

The Spün (pronounced ""spoon"") is available for pre-order on the company's website, and it will ship in June. Here's how it works: You use the Spün's app to take a picture of your meal. The app uses technology similar to face recognition to identify your food. Once you confirm what you're eating, you use the Bluetooth-connected Spün utensil to eat your dish, and the app will tell you the nutritional information for each spoonful or forkful you take (the utensil has an interchangeable  body for the included spoon and fork attachments) based on sensors that measure the weight of your bite.

This isn't the first smart utensil taking a micro-level look at how you eat The Bluetooth-enabled Hapifork we saw at CES 2013 vibrates when it senses you're eating too fast. Spün isn't quite as aggressive when you need to slow down between chomps -- the app will display your speed and politely suggest that you remember that your food isn't going anywhere (my words, not theirs).

Unfortunately (or fortunately?), neither smart utensil has figured out a way to track the food you eat with your hands, so you can still enjoy a cheeseburger in relative ignorance.

BeOn brings a new smart bulb to CES|"

BeOn's smart bulbs left us impressed when we tested them out in the CNET Smart Home last year. Now, for 2016, the security-minded connected LEDs are adding a BR30-shaped floodlight to the lineup -- an ideal shape for recessed fixtures.

The new bulb has the same features as the original A-shaped model, and the same yellow battery that pops in and out. That battery allows the bulbs to work even when the light is switched off (or when the power is out), and it also houses the Bluetooth radio that keeps them in sync with your phone.

Also packed into the battery: a microphone. You can train the bulbs to listen for the sound of your doorbell or alarm, and then program them to turn on automatically when they hear something. It's part of the product's emphasis on security, with BeOn citing the large number of daytime robberies where would-be intruders ring the doorbell to see if anyone's home before breaking in. A few lights coming on in staggered intervals could be enough to get them to think twice.

BeOn claims that it's working on new batteries with new features that you'll be able to swap in for the current ones. None of them are ready at this point, but BeOn's placement in the Z-Wave Alliance pavilion here at CES would seem to indicate that a battery with a Z-Wave radio would be one of the first ones coming. Other batteries might might potentially add in Wi-Fi for control beyond the home, or perhaps compatibility with Apple HomeKit, the set of smart home protocols programmed into iOS devices.

BeOn hasn't set pricing for the new floodlights yet but its rep tells me that they'll be comparable in price to the originals. Those sell for $75 each, or $200 for a three-bulb starter pack. A similarly priced BR30 starter pack seems like a safe bet -- we'll know for sure when the new bulbs go up for sale in the coming weeks.

Listen up, Halo's smoke alarms want to tell you what's wrong|"

The Nest Protect isn't the only game in town anymore. At CES 2016, I got a chance to see the Halo Smoke Alarm, an upcoming smart smoke and Carbon Monoxide detector that'll work with the Lowe's Iris system. The most robust of the three models on display, the Halo+, monitors the weather, and talks to you in case of emergency.

All three models issue voice alerts, actually. The three new products from startup Halo Smart Labs supposedly can tell the difference between fast and slow moving fires, with six different sensors packed in to help reduce false alarms. The only real difference with the Halo+ is it's weather monitoring.

You'll pay an extra $30 for that weather monitoring. Given that smart phones not only receives push notifications, but also weather alerts, I'm not sure how much usefulness the extra feature of the Halo+ alarm will add. I suppose not everyone keeps their phone on all the time while at home, and the Halo+ could be quite useful in that circumstance.

The Halo+ costs $130. The Halo battery powered smoke alarm and the Halo hardwired each cost $100. The Halo+ is hardwired. The battery version supposedly lasts 10 years, which helps it meet the safety requirements of states with stricter standards. First Alert's new HomeKit-enabled detectors also meet this requirement.

The voice alerts of all three could also be helpful. The Nest Protect -- the smart smoke alarm from the Google owned maker of the Nest Learning Thermostat -- also talks to you and lets you know where the emergency is happening. Thanks to the Lowe's Iris system, the Halo will aim to take that one step further, and let you know of a broader range of emergencies. A representative from Lowe's was excited to work on integrations with flood sensors, security monitors, and the like so that your smoke detector will let you know when anything in your smart home is amiss.

Lots of those integrations are still in process, and the detector itself is still seeking UL certification. Once it's ready this spring, if you're the type that wants a smart home but doesn't want to keep your smartphone on you at all times, the voice alerts of Halo's detectors could come in handy.

HomeAdvisor works with Alexa to call the plumber for you when you need it|"

Many smart home devices are great at detecting when something goes wrong in your home, but many of them aren't as good at doing something about it. HomeAdvisor, a free app with a growing list of collaborators, wants to change all of that. If your smart home finds a problem, HomeAdvisor will find the appropriate service person for you and have them call you.

HomeAdvisor started as essentially a filtered yellow pages. At CES 2016, the company announced three new integrations to help you find a vetted professional more easily.

As far as the new integrations, first, your Amazon Echo can learn a skill allowing you to ask it to find an electrician. Alexa, the personality built-in to Echo, will even offer a number for you to call, based on the one most likely to be available the soonest. (She learned a whole repertoire of new tricks at this year's show.)

Via the Apple TV, you can scroll through options on the big screen, book an appointment, and see the company's typical costs for your job.

All of that is fine and could save you some tedium, but the true power of the app comes into play with smart home sensors. The third new integration, with Zonoff, will let Zonoff powered smart home systems start the process of finding a pro for you when it senses something wrong.

For example, if your system senses a leak, you'll receive a notification as usual, and less than a minute later, a plumber from your area will call you. HomeAdvisor's back end algorithm searches through the same options it would normally present to you, calls them for you, and once someone answers, sends you the call.

It's unclear which exact smart home systems will work with HomeAdvisor, and that's the main reason I'm tempering my excitement. Zonoff powers Staples Connect, but it's unclear if all Zonoff systems will have this functionality.

The app, which will be available for iOS and Android, wasn't ready for a live demo at CES tonight. But a representative promised it'll be ready once the Apple and Amazon integrations are ready in a couple of months.

Without an actual demo or nameable smart home products, HomeAdvisor still has a ton to prove, but the concept of a smart home that can take an active step to help you when something goes wrong is cool enough that I'm hopeful if skeptical.

Lights, monitor, bedtime: Smart sleep system includes lamp, sensor to improve your rest|"

Tech companies have a growing interest in what you do in bed. Take, for example, Sleepace. The company displayed its Nox Smart Sleep System at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas Wednesday. Nox, which will cost $280 when its released in the first quarter of this year, includes a monitor that goes under your sheets, a smart sleep light and an app that work together to ensure a better night's sleep.

Many wearables track your sleep; the Misfit Ray and Fitbit Blaze are just a couple of examples of what we've seen so far at CES 2016. But there are a growing number of products like the Nox that put hardware in bed with you so you don't have to wear anything while you sleep, such as the yet-to-be-released Samsung SleepSense and the Beddit. But Nox steps away from the slumber pack by including a multi-function light in its system.

The Nox system's sleep monitor, called the RestOn, is a long, microfiber band filled with sensors that you lay between the mattress and your sheet. It gathers information about your sleep patterns, heart and breathing rates and body movement and sends it to an app that recommends what you can do to get better sleep. The RestOn also sends that information to the Nox light so it can adjust for the best sleeping conditions. For example, the Nox light will turn on to wake you up once the RestOn monitor senses that you're in the lightest part of your sleep cycle. The lamp will also play soothing sounds to help you settle in and turn off when you're asleep.

The Nox light is fairly small -- about eight inches tall and four inches wide. I'd be afraid of knocking it on the floor on those morning when I'm reaching for my glasses (bad vision is a struggle, guys). But it is a promising step to incorporate lighting into your sleep routine.

Sengled's making a smart speaker LED that listens, too|"

Sengled's been making smart bulbs that double as speakers for a few years now, but their next bulb's going to listen, too. Still an early prototype, the bulb is the Sengled Voice LED, and Sengled says we'll start seeing it in the back half of this year, with pricing yet to be determined (previous Sengled speaker bulbs have sold for $60 each or more -- roughly £40, or AU$85).

Just like the name suggests, you'll be able to control the Sengled Voice LED by talking to it. That includes telling the bulb to dim up and down, and also controlling the playback of whatever music might be streaming through its built-in speakers.

I asked Sengled's team how those voice controls will work -- the answer is that they aren't sure yet. The plan as of now is for the bulbs to use a wake phrase like ""Alexa"" or ""OK Google"" that would tell them to start listening for a command.

However, Sengled also tells me that the bulbs will keep an ear out for things like the smoke alarm or your baby crying -- if it hears anything amiss, it'll send you a notification using its built-in Wi-Fi radio. If it's your baby crying, you could speak to her through the bulbs, or tell them to stream her a lullaby.

Sengled isn't alone in the speaker bulb game. Earlier today at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Sony showed off a music playback bulb of its own -- no voice control with that one, though.

In addition to the Voice LED, Sengled offered a preview of the Sengled Link, a new device that'll let you sync Sengled Pulse speaker bulbs with your TV for a bulb-powered surround-sound setup. Like the Voice LED, there's no firm date or pricing info set just yet -- when we know more, we'll let you know."
This solar powered deadbolt from Brinks isn't picky -- any light will charge it|"

A black panel on the top half of the Brinks Array connected deadbolt looks unassuming at a glance, but when I looked closer, I saw the familiar lines of a solar panel. Slide the panel up, and it reveals a keypad underneath. The Brinks Array, the first smart lock from the reputed security firm, looks industrial, but along with solar power, it packs in plenty of friendly features. And Brinks is hoping the lock makes plenty of friends, as it's aiming to integrate the lock with all major smart home platforms including Apple's HomeKit, Google Brillo, and Samsung's SmartThings.

With built-in Wi-Fi, the Brinks Array connects directly to your router so you can use the iOS or Android app to lock and unlock your door from anywhere. That's expected for a smart lock, but most of the ones we've tested use Bluetooth to help their batteries last longer. Wi-Fi draws more power than the lower energy, shorter range Bluetooth.

Brinks mitigates the problem with a Lithium battery that can supposedly last a full year on its own under normal use, and the solar panel should hopefully keep it going much longer than that. A representative was hopeful that in a home with a moderate amount of direct sunlight, the panel could last a lifetime.

Without direct sunlight, you might have to replace those batteries eventually, but the unique tech of the Brinks Array can supposedly draw at least some power from any light source. Even your porchlight will charge it a bit. 1 hour of sunlight gives it 3% of its annual battery life, meaning you'd really only need roughly 33 hours over the course of the year to keep it fully charged.

How much power it draws from other sources is unclear, and the Brinks representative I spoke to didn't offer any battery estimates between the base of one year with no charge and his ambitious hope of a lifetime. That's understandable as the lock is still in the early stages of development, and not due out until later this year. Though, the hardware at least looked pretty well finished when I saw it at CES 2016. The app, however, wasn't ready for a demo.

The rest of the lock's features are pretty standard

When you're leaving, you can simply press the button on the front and the deadbolt will seal. For obvious security reasons, that button functionality doesn't work for unlocking the door.

Hopefully, by the time the lock is ready for retail, you'll have plenty of ways to include the Brinks Array in your larger smart home. Brinks is targeting all of the major platforms, and if it can pull off the trick of making friends with Apple, Google, and Samsung simultaneously, it'll position itself as a top contender in the rapidly growing field of connected deadbolts.

Get rid of that musty smell with Keen Home Smart Filters|"

Keen Home is adding a filter to its smart vent system. A logical next step to the Keen Home Smart Vents the company showed at last year's CES, the Keen Home Smart Filters snap into the vents, monitor air quality, and keep users informed about when they need to be swapped via the Keen Home app.

By partnering with filter company 3M, Keen Home obtained the pedigree to make me optimistic about the quality of these new smart filters, but the price leaves me skeptical about their value. The filters are an upgrade to the Vents, but you'll need to buy them separately and use them with the vents to make the most of their smart features. Each vent costs $80, and each filter runs $30, or you can pay a $3 per month per filter subscription cost and get replacements when you need them. For those in the UK and Australia, the vent price converts to roughly £55 and AU$113, respectively. The filters will cost £20 and AU$42, with the subscription £2 and AU$4

As a recap, the vents replace your existing vents and connect to an app, letting you open and close them remotely. They also include temperature sensors and can open and close automatically to help you adjust specific rooms to the temp of your choosing.

Since the vents were announced, they've been featured on ""Shark Tank"" and will now integrate with the Nest Learning Thermostat for a completely smart customized cooling system. The $80 vent price makes sense to me. It's a one-time cost that's a little expensive, but Keen Home recommends replacing only a third of your vents in key areas of your home. This avoids putting stress on your HVAC system, so setting up your whole place isn't as pricey as it might seem. Plus, once you're up and running, the system is supposed to save you plenty off your heating and cooling bills and make the rooms you inhabit that much more comfy.

Paying an extra $30 per filter, though the filter certainly makes sense as part of the system, dampens the long-term cost benefit of the Keen Home system. Most nonconnected filters, including those by 3M, cost around $10 to $15. If Keen Home's filters were to last a particularly long time, that would help alleviate my concerns.

If they're effective, the filters could still prove worthwhile for those with sensitive allergies. The Keen Home Smart Vent nonetheless stands as one of the products we're most excited to test out in the CNET Smart Home. The vents, along with the competition such as Ecovent, stand to potentially revolutionize how smart thermostats can be. The filters are a nice upgrade in theory, but they have a longer way to go to convince me that they're worth it.

Back up your DIY home security system with professional monitoring|"

Home security company ADT has embraced the smart home over the past year, partnering with big names in the market such as Samsung's SmartThings, Nest and LG. It's now announced Canopy, a new professional monitoring service for these partners, which will work with devices such as Samsung's Gear S2 watch (pictured above).

ADT's services have closely followed the traditional security firm paradigm for years. That means customers must pay for installation by a certified professional, agree to a specific contract length and fork over a monthly fee for features such as mobile alerts and 24-7 monitoring for the duration of the term. And an early cancellation typically means paying a termination fee.

Canopy will offer a flexible, contract-free service. It will be an optional service, available to ADT's partners on a month-to-month basis.

ADT isn't the only service that's stayed with traditional methods -- Vivint, AT&T and other professional home security firms have also kept close to the subscription model.

But the security industry has shifted significantly in recent years, as DIY devices gain a stronger hold on the market. For many customers, the flexibility of contract-free professional monitoring is a large part of the appeal. Companies such as Simplisafe and Scout already offer optional month-to-month monitoring -- and Scout announced a few weeks ago that it's extending its monitoring service to Samsung's SmartThings.

Professional firms have made some effort to adapt to the onslaught of new DIY products. ADT works with the Nest Learning Thermostat and announced in 2015 that it was working with LG on a standalone security device. Just this week, Vivint confirmed that it's joining forces with Amazon for integration with the Echo. Meanwhile AT&T's Digital Life already integrates with Samsung security cameras, the Ring Video Doorbell and an assortment of other DIY gadgets.

But today's announcement from ADT is by far the strongest indication that the DIY smart home plays a significant role in home security. So far, ADT has secured partnerships with Samsung's SmartThings system -- which can be monitored from an app on the Gear S2 watch -- along with LG, Kidde, the August Doorbell Cam, Wink, Honeywell's Lyric product line, the Ring Video Doorbell and the Roost Smart Battery.

ADT hasn't offered up details on pricing or availability just yet, but claims that information will be available ""shortly.""

New Ezviz camera boasts a high IQ for a low price|"

One of the most interesting indoor cameras at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week is the Ezviz Mini IQ. At $140, and going on sale sometime after May, the Mini IQ boasts some impressive specs, including 1080p HD resolution, two-way audio and more.

Ezviz -- known for its consummately affordable Ezviz Mini -- is also mixing up its strategy by integrating with other smart home technology. Built into the camera will be a Z-Wave radio transmitter, meaning the Mini IQ will be one of the only cameras out there to not only save footage using Wi-Fi, but also communicate directly with connected gadgets such as locks, thermostats, outlets and so on.

At this point, though, Ezviz wouldn't share any specific partnerships or compatible devices, so we don't know what exactly it will communicate with -- just that it has the hardware to communicate.

Ezviz knows how to do affordable. $140 for a quality HD camera is a rare find. Many similarly priced cameras, such as the Homeboy, offer much lower resolution. And ones with HD resolution, such as Netgear's Arlo or Samsung's SmartCam HD Pro, can cost up to twice as much as the Mini IQ.

The Mini IQ also offers safety mechanisms for power outages or disconnections. The camera itself will shut off to save power (lasting up to three months on batteries), but a passive infrared sensor will wake up the camera to record any motion that it detects. This is a cool backup option in addition to the Mini IQ's other steps, such as sending alarm notifications if power source cuts out or if the batteries are running low.

People familiar with Ezviz's super-cheap Mini might be surprised by the payment plans for cloud footage. These plans aren't new, but unlike the original Ezviz Mini, the Mini IQ won't include a free year of cloud storage -- just a free month. That means the rates will matter a lot more to potential buyers.

It breaks down like this: Ezviz's seven-day plan will offer rolling storage of the last week of footage for $5 per month or $50 per year, while the 30-day rolling storage plan costs $10 per month or $100 per year. The two plans are competitively priced -- comparing favorably to those from Belkin and Arcsoft -- but for me, setting up local storage will almost always be preferable to monthly fees.

Ezviz hasn't announced any concrete release dates for the Mini IQ, but some regions seem more certain than others. The Mini IQ is slotted to release sometime after May of 2016 in the US, but the timeline and pricing for release in the UK and Australia are unclear. Converted roughly, the Mini IQ's $140 price tag is £95 and AU$195.

Ezviz Mini Cube home camera scans either outdoors or inside|"

In terms of keeping an eye out for events inside the home, especially when you're not around, it's hard to beat the peace of mind that comes with owning a Wi-Fi camera. The majority of these gizmos, however, are built for duty indoors and aren't tough enough to withstand exposure to the elements. Enter the $110 Mini Cube from wireless camera maker Ezviz. Despite the company's playful name, it plans to pack a lot of sophisticated technology into the Mini Cube such as HD resolution, a rugged and moisture resistant exterior, night vision, plus a battery pack for increased portability.

You're probably asking why would you need a camera outside your house? Frankly there are many compelling reasons. A connected camera placed just outside the front door could send you alerts anytime a visitor comes calling or when a package arrives. Likewise if said package is delivered but is later pilfered by unknown culprits, a camera on guard duty could help authorities identify and track down the perpetrators.

Other helpful skills Ezviz claims the Mini Cube brings to the table are both night vision and motion sensing abilities. Indeed according to the company the Mini Cube will have the power to see in the dark at a distance of up to 30 feet. An integrated motion sensor will also act as a virtual tripwire and wake the camera within the blink of an eye (600 milliseconds to be exact).

And because of this cooperation between the Mini Cube's motion sensor and imaging systems, the machine says Ezviz will be quite efficient, allowing the camera to function in a deep standby mode and only rarely take small sips from its battery. Of course if you have an outdoor AC power socket handy, you can supply the Mini Cube with electricity this way as well.

Aside from some of the Ezviz Mini Cube's top-line specs, other important details about the camera remain out of focus for the moment. For example, judging by its name alone I expect the Mini Cube to be quite compact. Ezviz has offered up some numbers for the device's physical dimensions, it's essentially a perfect cube measuring 2.2 inches (55 mm on all sides). Of course I can't confirm until I get my hands on it personally.

The same is true concerning the camera's chamber which holds four CR123A batteries (disposable not rechargeable) which Ezviz explains will power the machine for as long as 2 months. Real-world run time could vary greatly depending on how much action the Mini Cube sees.

Predicting when the Mini Cube will hit store shelves is the most unclear piece of the puzzle since the company hasn't released availability dates either. It is likely that product will share the launch date of another of Ezviz's new cameras, the Ezviz Mini IQ which is expected to ship by May 2016.

SimpliSafe adds camera to home security system|"

When we first reviewed the SimpliSafe home security system, we liked the easy-to-install package enough to give it a Editors' Choice award. But one knock against SimpliSafe was the company's lack of a camera in its security offerings. This year, SimpliSafe will address that need with the addition of a wireless camera to its lineup of home security products.

SimpliSafe displayed its new camera Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The camera is currently in beta testing, but is set for release in February or March. The final price hasn't been set, but SimpliSafe estimates that the camera will cost around $200, which is comparable to other security cameras such as the Nest Cam and the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro. But monitoring will cost an additional monthly fee that starts at $15.

The SimpliSafe camera looks similar to other models we've seen. The lens is mounted on a rectangular body that hovers slightly above where it sits. It's pretty light, too -- about as heavy as a deck of cards. I'll be eager to see if the SimpliSafe camera will be as praise-worthy as the company's previous products.

The Edyn Water Valve aims to deliver the perfect amount of garden refreshment at CES 2016|"

Edyn has long promised a water valve to go along with the slickly designed Edyn Garden Sensor, and at CES 2016, Edyn's finally showing it off. With the ability to sync up to the sensor and deliver the exact amount of water your plants need, the water valve completes the Edyn system, making garden care that much more hands-free, and will be available for retail this Spring.

As expected, the design of the water valve looks great. Pictures had been released with the original Edyn Kickstarter back in 2014 and the whole system was designed by the Yves Behar led Fuseproject firm known for the August lock and Jawbone Up wearables. The water valve's price was $60 for preorder back during the Kickstarter campaign, and no retail pricing has yet been announced. Given the precedent of the sensor, though, I'd expect the final price to be similar. The Sensor's preorder and retail pricing were the same.

The Edyn Water Valve will work with any above ground irrigation or hose fed system. It's not compatible with built-in irrigation systems, so it's not competitive with the likes of the Rachio Iro, the GreenIQ Garden Hub, or the Blossom Smart Irrigation Controller. It's more along the lines of the upcoming $67 Wise Orchard waterer. The Edyn Valve will work independently of the Sensor, but you'll obviously see more precise watering with the two working in tandem.

Well, hopefully that's true. I had my hopes set pretty high for the Edyn Garden Sensor, shown at CES last year. The mix of specs, a great design, and a clever looking app made it seem like this was garden device perfection. When I reviewed it this Spring, I found the incomplete and buggy app let it down in a few ways, and worried that the lack of responsiveness might actually cause problems if synced to the upcoming water valve. The sensor didn't recognize it had enough water for a couple of hours after I watered it. With that delay, the automated valve could end up watering way too much.

Fortunately, it seems like Edyn's taken note of the apps shortcomings, and have announced several changes to improve the features and responsiveness on the software side of things. More dynamic data, in addition to a supposedly improved plant search, better plant recommendations, and fixed memory leaks that caused delays and glitches are all coming shortly to the app in an update. Together, these fixes should go a long way toward alleviating my concerns.

In all, I'm glad the Edyn Water Valve will give me another reason to dive into the Edyn system again. It had so much promise before, and I'm hoping that this time, it'll come that much closer to its potential.

Oco is back at CES with an all-new security camera|"

We reviewed the original Oco HD Wi-Fi Camera last March, a live-streaming HD model with a low monthly cloud storage fee. Now the team behind it is back at CES with Oco2, their next-generation security camera.

Oco2 is priced at $149. International pricing isn't available yet, but it roughly converts to £100 or AU$210.

Aside from a clear design update -- the previous Oco cam used the same third-party manufacturer as ArcSoft's Simplicam -- Oco2 also offers a new storage option. Oco2 is also equipped with a microSD card slot so you can save footage locally. This allows you to if you want to store your own video clips rather than sign up for to a fee-based cloud subscription.

This hybrid storage feature isn't exactly new, though. Models like the Ezviz Mini already offer both and  iSmartAlarm's Spot, Netgear's Arlo Q and Icontrol's Piper NV all offer free cloud storage. Still, it's a definite improvement for Oco.

Other key features include:

Oco2 is expected to go on sale this spring, so check back soon for updates.

iLumi's new smart bulb lets you take the color-changing light outdoors|"

iLumi's color-changing bulbs are a fun mood-lighting novelty for the modern smart home -- but what if you want to bring the party outdoors?

iLumi brought the answer to this week's Consumer Electronics Show here in Las Vegas: a weather-rated version of its color-changing BR30 floodlight that you can use outdoors. They'll cost $70 each, and begin selling by this spring.

iLumi's bulbs rely on Bluetooth to communicate with your phone, so I'll be interested to see how the outdoor bulbs perform when you're trying to control them from inside. That's the sort of thing we'll test out at the CNET Smart Home when we review the bulbs later this year.

In addition to the new outdoor bulb, iLumi offered a look at a new system control switch that the company hopes to introduce later in the year. The idea is that you'll be able to trigger various lighting presets simply by waving your hand over top of a small, rectangular puck.

That's a similar pitch to what we heard from Fibaro, a European company that introduced the Fibaro Swipe smart-home gesture controller earlier this week.

iLumi also promises to introduce more third-party integrations in 2016, with IFTTT and Amazon Echo sitting at the top of the list. That would help the bulbs catch up with the Lifx Color 1000, our current top pick in the color-changing light bulb category. We'll keep an eye on things and keep you posted as they develop."
Breathe easy: First Alert's connected cam tracks your child's breathing|"

Editors' note, January 3, 2017: This preview from CES 2016 has been updated with new info from CES 2017.

I'll admit, my eyes glazed over a bit when a First Alert representative said his connected camera had ""non-contact video respiration detection."" As he explained further, I understood how important this feature could be. This OneLink by First Alert connected cam functions as a baby monitor with all the normal basics that entails: 1080p video along with an air quality detector. But it brings something new and unexpected to the table -- it monitors and tracks your child's breathing.

We first saw the cam at last year's CES in prototype form. Now, at CES 2017's Unveiled press event, the device has polish and an official name: OneLink by First Alert Envirocam. The rep I talked to last year wouldn't tell me exactly how it works, but if it does what's promised, it could indeed be a fantastic addition to smart-home baby cams.

From a position near where your child is sleeping, the OneLink Cam will send you a live feed in high definition and will alert you if your child's breathing stops, or even if it changes suddenly. You'll know if your child is taking shallow or deep breaths, and the OneLink cam will track the patterns so you get extra insight into how your baby is sleeping.

The cam also features two-way audio, motion detection and night vision. A PR rep for the company confirmed there would be no monthly fees. I'd still like to find out the range of the cam, and how far away it can pick up breathing patterns. I'll be sure to update with more details as they become available, and hopefully, now that it's no longer a prototype, we'll find out the rest of the details about price and availability soon.

When I saw it at Unveiled last year, the OneLink by First Alert Envirocam looked like an ordinary IP camera, but its marquee feature has the potential to make it much more than that."
Icon Smartech thinks your thermostat needs a makeover|"

Connected thermostats are a familiar fixture in the smart home industry -- where names such as Nest, Honeywell and Ecobee reign supreme. But other companies continue to introduce competing models to the market and Icon Smartech's Icon Home is one of the most recent iterations.

The new Icon Home, on display at CES 2016, is actually an Android tablet designed to replace your existing heating and cooling controller. Of course, the idea here is that you'd be able to access information beyond basic indoor temperature readings.

Through Wi-Fi, the Icon Home is supposed to be able to pull in temperature data to issue weather alerts in your area, as well as audio-based calendar reminders and even support apps like Skype -- although I'm not convinced that many people want to stand in a random hallway where their thermostat is installed and have a lengthy video chat.

As far as smart functionality, a representative from Icon Smartech explained that the Icon Home pulls in temperature data from the local forecast and can update your indoor temperature accordingly. You can also make manual adjustments on the device itself, of course, as well as through the related app.

Pricing has not been set for Ion Home, but it's expected to sell for roughly $250-$300 (about £200 or AU$400) when it becomes available later this year.

The Fibaro Swipe makes your hand the remote|"

While everyone dreams of voice control, Fibaro's newly announced Swipe will command the smart home with something else: hand gestures. Swipe is releasing in the US ($150) and the UK (about £100) at the end of January and in Australia (approx. AU$208) later this year, and it looks a little like a tablet -- it's a 5-by-7-inch pad. Instead of a touchscreen, though, Swipe uses 3D Near-Field motion identification technology to sense and respond to hand gestures.

The two big questions with a gadget like Swipe are ""Does it work?"" and ""What does it work with?""

Here's what we know already: Swipe can identify and respond to six distinct gestures: four directional swipes (up, down, left, right), and two circular motions (left, right). Each motion or combination of motions will activate a preset scene or command -- for instance, swiping ""right"" could turn on the radio, ""up"" could turn up the volume, ""down"" could turn it down, and ""left"" could turn it off. One simple swipe could also issue multiple commands at once, like turning on your lights and your TV.

Swipe can also blend into your home pretty well. You can fit a picture  into it like a frame, hang it on a wall, or even install it under a  kitchen counter. Since it's using Near-Field scanning technology,  obstructions like countertops or even drywall won't inhibit its  functionality. This is a pretty cool feature, and installing it inside a wall would make it a sort of invisible light switch with expanded capabilities.

Fibaro isn't the first company to have the idea to turn your hand into a remote; Singlecue introduced users to channel surfing with Jedi-like hand waves. But Fibaro hopes to broaden its uses to include more than controlling entertainment systems. Swipe, ideally, would control your home.

For this kind of gadget, success often depends on how intuitive it feels, which we can't know till we get our hands on one. The most notable shortcoming right now is that you have to gesture right in front of the pad itself. That means no control from across the room, like with Singlecue. Simply put, this is a problem.

That said, Swipe does have potential. My personal standard for smart home efficiency is, ""Is it easier than flipping the light switch?"" Too many smart home products answer, ""No."" But if Swipe can turn off my lights and lock my doors with a single gesture, it could very well reach my standard.

Fibaro's new device is built to administrate other gadgets, so I really want to know what it works with. Sadly, it uses only the Z-Wave radio frequency. That means instead of employing multiple frequencies and a Wi-Fi shift to ensure communication with as many devices as possible, Swipe will work only with Z-Wave devices and hubs -- a disappointment, since its compatibility will be restricted because of this.

After working with apps that constantly require usernames and passwords, Swipe's simple interface really appeals to me. But as voice control grows and develops, I wonder if a pad that requires you to stand right in front of it will cut it for much longer. And the $150 price tag doesn't help matters. Hopefully, if the usability really impresses and if the partnerships continue to grow, Swipe will be a helpful tool for easing access to some otherwise clunky smart home technology."
Flir's new thermal camera heats things up at CES|"

Camera manufacturer Flir is well known for its thermal models that attach directly to a variety of Android and iOS devices. We reviewed the $250 Flir One (for iOS) back in 2015 and found that its MSX tech enhances the image quality over competing models, such as the $250 Seek Thermal Camera.

But, what about folks interested in smaller, more reasonably-priced thermal cameras (traditional models can cost thousands) who don't have compatible smart phones or tablets?

Enter: Flir's new Scout TK. According to Flir, the Scout TK is a ""pocket-sized"" camera that doesn't need a secondary device to operate. Instead, it captures video and pictures ""internally."" It also boasts a few upgrades over the Flir One:

Flir's new Scout TK will retail for $599 and is expected to be available on Flir.com and Amazon.com ""later this year.""

In the meantime, check out the rest of our CES 2016 coverage.

It's supposed to have a longer range so it can pick up on thermal readings from up to 100 yards away.It weighs 6 ounces and is supposedly weather-proofed and durable enough to handle the elements as well as falls.It is designed to last for up to five hours of continual use."
Ping family and friends straight from Vivint's new security camera|"

Vivint just introduced a next-gen camera called Ping to its home security lineup at CES 2016 -- and it has a unique feature.

While many cameras available today offer two-way talk -- that's intercom-style communication between a microphone-and-speaker-equipped camera and a smartphone -- Vivint's new cam boasts a built-in button on top that anyone can press to ""Ping"" other users associated with the account.

Traditionally, two-way communication can only be initiated from a mobile app on a smartphone or tablet, but Ping is changing all that with this new call-out feature.

In addition to Ping's outgoing call button, the camera also offers:

Vivint is also introducing a new thermostat to its lineup, the Vivint Element, designed to work in concert with many of Vivint's other security accessories. Pricing for the Ping camera and Element thermostat have not been announced just yet, but both are slated for this spring.

D-Link detects your smoke alarms from a distance at CES 2016|"

Ready to listen for trouble, the Mydlink Smart Alarm Detector will keep you posted if it hears something. A Wi-Fi connected box that plugs into your wall, the detector listens for the alarms of smoke or CO detectors and sends you a push notification if it hears something.

Compatible with the Mydlink Home app, the device can also interact with other D-Link connected devices, switching off a light plugged into a D-Link switch. And thanks to D-Link's new IFTTT channel, if the Smart Alarm detector hears something, it can act as a trigger for any number of smart home devices.

With a range of 50 feet, the Smart Alarm listens for the specific sounds of UL certified detectors to minimize false alarms while maintaining reliability. If you find a good spot for it, you can use one device to enable remote notifications for multiple detectors in your home.

Due out in the second quarter of 2016, you'll be able to purchase a Mydlink Smart Alarm Detector for $60, making it a much more cost effective way of adding basic smarts to multiple detectors, as opposed to a wholesale replacement like the second generation $100 Nest Protect.

D-Link isn't actually breaking new ground with the Smart Alarm Detector. The Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight does essentially the same thing and includes a nightlight and a microphone so you can listen to the alarm remotely. I didn't find that listening to the alarm added much to the experience, as the sound quality wasn't high enough to discern what was actually going on, but the basic features worked well and the nightlight provided a charming touch.

D-Link kept things simple -- it listens for an alarm and triggers whatever alert you'd like if it hears something. Its $60 price justifies that against Leeo's $100 list price, but you can find Leeo for $50 now on Amazon, so you'd have to take advantage of D-Link's interoperability with other D-Link devices or IFTTT to redeem its value.

If you don't have a good hallway outlet that can hear multiple alarms, the most cost effective path to simple smarts might be the $35 Roost Smart Battery, a retrofit 9V with push notifications.

If D-Link's solution is responsive and reliable, it's promised interoperability with IFTTT and affordable price should make it a solid option for simple connected safety.

Our homes are getting smarter, from hue-shifting lightbulbs to thermostats that know your commute. And Sevenhugs Smart Remote aims to be the single, contextually aware remote control you need to master them all.

Point the Smart Remote at a Philips Hue smart lightbulb and you can tap on its touchscreen display to turn off the bulb. Then, point the remote at your Sonos speaker and the screen's display will not let you crank up the volume, or switch tracks. Here's the ""contextually aware"" bit: point it at your fireplace, and you can bump the temperature up on your Nest Thermostat. Or maybe you just want to know if you need to tote an umbrella -- point the Smart Remote at your window, and it'll show you the weather forecast.

It kinda sounds like dark magic, right? It's actually quite simple: the Smart Remote understands where it is in your home, thanks to Wi-Fi and three connected sockets that are included in the package. The remote triangulates its position between these sockets to a range of about 10 meters (30 feet), and you can train it to associate a particular spot with a particular gadget: that space on the wall, your fireplace or window becomes tied to your Nest.

Sevenhugs' Smart Remote is still under development. The chubby prototype on display here at CES 2016  in Las Vegas looks nothing like the swanky, colorful remotes shown on Sevenhugs' site. And it's currently limited to the Philips Hue, Sonos speakers and the Nest Thermostat.

But I was told that it has the potential to work with any smart home appliance that connects to your Wi-Fi or via Bluetooth, so other partners should be available soon. Better still, the connected sockets you'll use to help the Smart Remote find its way double as a way to get ""dumb"" devices in on the action. I saw a prototype socket shaped as a lightbulb socket, and watched a normal light bulb turned on with a press.

Sevenhugs' Smart Remote will be available for preorder sometime between February and March, and is slated to ship in September. Sevenhugs hasn't ruled out a Kickstarter campaign, but one isn't currently planned. There's also no word on a price: I was told that the company is aiming to land at under $200, which converts to around £140 or AU$280, and would get you the remote and three connected sockets."
Whirlpool's new connected fridge offers smart features and smarter storage|"

Reports of the death of the smart fridge were premature. Case in point, the debut of the Whirlpool Smart French Door Refrigerator at the Consumer Electronics Showcase in Las Vegas. Along with a re-designed interior built to optimize storage, the $3,800 appliance boasts Wi-Fi connectivity and compatibility with the Nest Learning Thermostat.

Whirlpool claims this fridge is packed full of good ideas. The one Whirlpool is most proud of: a compartmentalized, pantry-inspired layout that promises a place for everything. Whirlpool's team claims that the design yields up to 30 percent more usable space through smarter organization, with modular shelves that slide and flip out of the way as needed. With 32 cubic feet of total storage space, you shouldn't have any trouble fitting in enough groceries for the whole family.

The fridge also features a Party Mode that promises to fill the ice bin faster for your guests, and automatically dial the temperature down in anticipation of repeated openings. That seems like an objectively cool feature, and one that we'll be sure to test out for ourselves in the coming months.

On the smarts front, the fridge will sync with an app on your phone over Wi-Fi, and notify you if the fridge ever loses power or needs a new filter. If something stops working, you'll see an error-specific code in the Whirlpool app to help steer support in the right direction.

That's the same sort of basic smart functionality we've seen in previous generations of smart fridges. Back then, that smart functionality wasn't enough in and of itself for the things to catch on with buyers. That might largely explain this smart refrigerator's additional focus on interior design.

Whirlpool's fridge also syncs with Nest via Nest Rush Hour Rewards. Take advantage, and your thermostat will tell your fridge to hold off on the defrost cycles until off-peak hours. That's a nice little extra for Nest-users, and one that's been a long time coming for smart fridge fans -- Whirlpool was first announced as a ""Works with Nest"" partner back in 2014, but has only supported smart laundry integrations until now.

The Whirlpool Smart French Door Refrigerator is expected to start selling in the US this May, with a starting price of $3,800. Whirlpool tells me it'll come in black, white or fingerprint-resistant stainless steel. We'll be sure to get our hands all over it for a full review in the coming months."
More than just good looks, the Ween smart thermostat has brains as well|"

You'd be forgiven at first glance for having no idea what the Ween actually does. Between the odd name and the design that makes it look like the star of ""Wall-E 2"", it's not immediately obvious that this is a smart thermostat, or as the French manufacturers call it a ""home smart time solution"".

(For an American audience, the fact the read out is in Celsius might add even more to the confusion, but that's just how France rolls. And England. And Australia. And anywhere apart from Bahamas, Belize, the Cayman Islands, Palau and the US.)

Ween has just completed its second round of funding and it's expected to be available in its native France within three months before moving on to rest of the world. The device has the usual automated temperature controls that are the hallmarks of the connected thermostat in the modern smart home. It also automatically adjusts the temperature in real-time based on your absences from the house.

To detect all this in real time it pairs with your smart phone, determining your whereabouts and raising or lowering the temperature accordingly. Ween claims that this means it ""boasts twice the savings compared to a learning thermostat"" but its not immediately clear just exactly how this differs from such thermostats like, for example, the Nest.

The design is certainly markedly different, with the little silver 'hat' acting as the main interface: twist to adjust temperature, tap to confirm. All very simple, but with the downside that you'll still need a wall mounted unit for it to communicate with.

One thing the manufacturers were extremely eager to make clear: no data of any kind regarding your whereabouts is stored on the cloud. It's all device based for ""the best security""."
Siri hits the fan: Hunter debuts a HomeKit-enabled ceiling fan at CES 2016|"

Siri's learning some new tricks at CES 2016. On display at CES Unveiled, Hunter ceiling fans will work with Apple's Homekit, allowing full control and integration with other HomeKit devices as well as voice control with Siri. These are the first ceiling fans to work with HomeKit, and the lineup that launched with a variety of switches and lightbulbs is starting to gain a bit more robust functionality.

The Hunter fans will come in two styles, called Symphony and Signal. I saw and got to play with the pretty plastic and fully functional Symphony at CES Unveiled. The demo used a doll house with wooden figures to trigger its functions, and showed how HomeKit's system can work together to create scenes involving both the LED of the fan, and the fan itself. When a representative moved a figure to one room in the dollhouse, the real life fan above me turned on while the lights in the dollhouse turned off. When he shifted it to another, the light turned on and the fan off.

It was a nice demo, but I was disappointed that the company didn't have a real life app ready to show me. But that's not the point with HomeKit, really. Since all devices compatible with the smart home software built into your iPhone speak the same language, any HomeKit app will be able to control the Hunter ceiling fans when they go to retail in February. Better yet, once you're set up, you won't have to use an app, as Siri can do the work for you.

I'm looking forward to creating a ""bedtime"" scene that not only turns off the lights and locks the doors, but turns on the ceiling fan above my bed.

Both the Symphony and the Signal will have a similar price that a representative promised me would be under $400. That's also pretty exciting, as smart ceiling fan options in general are limited and the other prominent one from Big Ass Fans costs more than $1,000.

Smiling while you lose: Qardiobase puts a friendly face on weight monitoring|"

Whether you're trying to put on some mass or strip off those pounds, the bathroom scale is rarely a happy sight. In fact, those numbers can be downright disheartening at times and, when looked at in the long term, sometimes don't actually accurately represent where you are in terms of achieving your goals.

Qardio, who also makes the Qardioarm blood pressure monitor and the Qardiocore EKG (no, really), understands this.

Like other smart scales, such as the newly announced Polar Balance, the $149 (around ‎£100, AU$205) Qardiobase does a lot more than just tell you how much you weigh. The scale also measure body fat percentage, muscle mass and even bone and water composition, offering a more rounded look at your overall fitness levels.

More importantly -- and this might be my favourite feature I've seen on a device like this -- it has a Smart Feedback Mode that does away with numbers altogether and just offers a smiley face to tell you that you're still on track with your long term goal. (Or a frowny face to say you're not, but lets not worry just yet about proving to be a disappointment to your bathroom scale.)

This isn't just about the raw numbers: the Qardiobase will give you that winning grin, even if your weight might be up, because all the additional data it collects lets it account for the regular weight fluctuations that naturally occur, meaning you you don't get disheartened over a pound here and there when the long view is actually looking rosy."
The newest smart fan from Big Ass Solutions is the most affordable one yet|"

The cheekily named Big Ass Fans made a smart-home splash in 2014 when it unveiled a gorgeous Wi-Fi-enabled ceiling fan packed with intelligent sensor tech. The only problem? That ceiling fan cost over a thousand dollars.

Now, for 2016, Big Ass Fans is back with a new version of that smart ceiling fan that will retail for just $450 -- less than half the cost of the original. Called the Haiku L Series, the ceiling fan comes in white or black and sports the same modern aesthetic as the original.

The L Series takes a different approach to smart features, though. The original Haiku that retailed for $1,045 had the brand's ""SenseMe"" tech built right in, enabling it to run automatically based on presence detection and room-specific climate conditions. With the L Series, the SenseMe tech is pulled out of the fan and relocated to the new Haiku Wall Control unit, which will retail separately for $125.

That smarts-sold-separately approach means that you'll need to spend a total of $575 in order to enjoy the full benefits of a connected ceiling fan. That includes the Haiku's integration with the Nest Learning Thermostat that allows it to work in tandem with your HVAC system to help maintain your home's ideal temperature while lowering your energy bill.

There are new features and integrations planned for 2016, too. Most notable among them: voice control by way of an integration with the Amazon Echo smart speaker. Big Ass Solutions plans on demonstrating the feature in Las Vegas before rolling it out a little later this year.

The new fan and wall control unit are both parts of a new lineup of Haiku-branded smart home devices that the Lexington, Kentucky-based manufacturer is debuting at the Consumer Electronics Showcase in Las Vegas. That new ""Haiku Home"" lineup is actually an entire, smart home-centric division of Big Ass Solutions, joining the two company's other two divisions, Big Ass Fans and Big Ass Light.

Still, it's the Haiku smart fan that's the centerpiece of Big Ass Solutions' ambitions for the connected home. Cutting the price roughly in half is an aggressive step for the traditionally high-end brand, and one that signals a serious push to put the company's unique take on the connected living space into as many homes as possible.

The Haiku L Series fan and the Haiku Wall Control unit will both be available direct from the Haiku Home website by the end of January. The rest of the new Haiku Home line includes smart recessed lighting fixtures that are expected to arrive this April -- beyond that, Big Ass Solutions plans to release a Wi-Fi-connected HVAC unit, though no release date is set just yet."
LG's bringing a brainy smart home control device to CES|"

Smart hubs that promise to wrangle all of your home devices into one system are nothing new. Still, LG plans to add another one to the mix at next week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The cylindrical SmartThinQ Hub can communicate with a variety of devices using common smart home protocols, including Bluetooth, Z-Wave and ZigBee. When your smart home is up to something, it'll tell you all about it on a 3.5-inch LCD display.

With speakers built into its mesh base (available in black or ""champagne gold"") the gadget draws a few inevitable comparisons to the Amazon Echo smart speaker. Like Echo, the SmartThinQ Hub can stream music, either from iHeartRadio or from your personal collection, but there's no cloud-connected, voice-activated AI housed within. The SmartThinQ Hub will announce new notifications as they happen, but it won't listen the way Amazon Echo will.

LG's SmartThinQ-branded ovens and washing machines were among the first generation of smart appliances. As the name would suggest, the SmartThinQ Hub promises to work with them, along with other smart appliances and Web-connected televisions. The Hub will also work directly with the SmartThinQ Sensor for washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners that LG unveiled back in September, so you'll be able to bring non-connected appliances into the mix as well.

Aside from LG's own hardware, the Hub touts compatibility with the Nest Learning Thermostat, the online automation service IFTTT, and Lifx' color-changing smart LEDs, among others. There's no word on whether or not the SmartThinQ Hub will actually help any of those devices work together, or offer its own automation and rule-making functions within the smartphone app. We'll look into all of that next week, when we get a closer look at the thing.

Also unknown at this time: pricing and availability.

Given those Echo comparisons, I'd be surprised to see the SmartThinQ Hub ring it at more than the $180 (£120/AU$250, converted roughly) that Amazon charges for its smart home cylinder, especially given that Echo houses its own AI and the SmartThinQ Hub does not. We'll see soon enough, though."
GE's bright idea: a brighter Bright Stik LED|"

The original, 60W replacement version of GE's Bright Stik LED was one of our favorite value bulbs of 2015. Now, for 2016, GE is releasing a bigger, brighter version of the Bright Stik that's designed to put out as much light as a 100W incandescent bulb. Soft white versions of the light will sell in two-packs at Sam's Club locations for a price of $16 -- by far the lowest price we've seen for a 100W replacement LED from a major manufacturer.

That still might sound like a lot to spend on a light bulb, but factor the energy savings in. Assuming you're using it for an average of three hours per day, a 100W incandescent will add about $12 to your yearly energy bill. On the other hand, with a power draw of just 16 watts, the 100W Replacement Bright Stik LED will add less than $2. At $8 each, the Bright Stik LED will pay for itself in less than a year, and it'll also last about 15 times longer than that incandescent -- 15,000 hours in total, backed by a five-year warranty.

AT&T Digital Life review:|"

CNET has kept its finger on the pulse of the growing do-it-yourself security market for some time -- reviewing tons of modular security setups. But now, thanks to the CNET Smart Home, I have the opportunity to review whole-home systems.

Of course, professionally installed security is a  different animal from more modular options. Instead of assembling  individual products, like a thermostat, an alarm or a lock, you sign an  extended contract, get a fully integrated system, and pay a monthly fee till the contract ends. That means we have to work with companies more closely than usual. After arranging an install of one of AT&T's Digital Life packages, though, I finally got a chance to spend a week and a half testing it out at the CNET Smart Home.

Overall, Digital Life is very recommendable. The app interface is slick, the security features are market-competitive, and the home automation devices, while a little basic individually, benefit from beautiful integration. The biggest weakness of AT&T Digital Life is the price point. Between a two-year contract, monthly fees of $40, $55 or $65, initial equipment fees ($50, $150 and $200, respectively), and potential cancellation fees, consumers should be wary of jumping onboard without due consideration. But for anyone in need of professionally monitored smart-home security -- especially those trying to avoid the guesswork of installing do-it-yourself systems -- Digital Life is one of the best options out there.

I wanted to approach the AT&T Digital Life install like any customer would, so I began by surveying the various security systems available to the average consumer. I knew plenty of do-it-yourself security systems, like SimpliSafe and iSmartAlarm, sell for a few hundred bucks and require no contractual obligations. Usually, these include a couple contact sensors -- devices that indicate whether doors or windows are open or closed -- a motion detector or two, a remote, an alarm, a camera or any combination of these gadgets.

And many of the base packages for professionally installed systems looked similar. AT&T Digital Life's ""Smart Security"" package, for instance, included six contact sensors, a motion detector, a keypad and an alarm.

As you upgrade, though, you can add cameras, flood sensors, connected outlets, smart door locks and more. For this review, AT&T installed a slightly personalized version of the ""Premium Security and Automation"" package. What became apparent was, whereas DIY systems will fit the needs of some smaller houses   and apartments, professional systems like AT&T's will scale to the   needs of almost any home.

Besides scaling, professional security has another major advantage over DIY systems: 24-7 professional monitoring. In the case of an emergency, AT&T Digital Life, like other professional systems, will contact the appropriate authorities. Many DIY systems will send you a smartphone notification or set off an alarm, but they won't call the police or fire department. (Some DIY systems are adding this feature, though it will entail a monthly monitoring fee.)

The problem with professional monitoring is the contract that's usually involved. Most security systems will cost you at least $30 a month, and they often include additional fees for installation, technology, or both. AT&T Digital Life's system, over the full two-year contract, will charge you between $1,010 and $1,760, not including any extra devices you elect to purchase beyond the packages. Plus, if you decide to cancel after the first two weeks, you'll have to pay off about $30 per month remaining in your contract.

From early on, I liked Digital Life for a few reasons. First, it has the most straightforward pricing of any professional security system. On the website, you can find all the basic information for contract lengths, initial equipment fees and monthly costs. Listed alongside that information is each package's included devices. Many comparable companies require customers to call in for a quote, contract lengths and other pricing particulars.

AT&T's packages are also well designed (except for the mid-range $55  one; more on that later). The $40/mo ""Smart Security"" package matches the rates  (plus or minus $5) of similar packages from Frontpoint, Protect America, ADT,  and other leading providers. The ""Premium Security and Automation""  package includes loads of gadgets, and slides in at $65/mo, just under Vivint's priciest package  (although Vivint's initial setup fee is lower). In addition, you can  personalize your package by starting with the basics and adding  individually priced packages like ""cameras,"" ""locks,"" ""energy"" ""water  detection"" and others.

When it came time for the installation, like any customer, I waited while AT&T specialists -- all of whom receive background checks before assuming home installation duties -- placed sensors and other gadgets around the CNET Smart Home. The technicians were professional: each even donned booties when inside the home.

Post-install, the on-site manager walked me through the Digital Life system and   answered my questions. AT&T clearly fulfilled all the must-haves I   was looking for: wireless connection, tamper-alarms, diverse sensors,   professional monitoring, and remote access. The one big difference between our setup and the typical Digital Life   installations was the alarm triggers. Local police and fire departments   really hate false alarms from security  monitoring services, and  rightly so, since those false alarms waste  municipal  resources. For  the purpose of this review, AT&T put the monitoring  service in test  mode. They could see our system, but they wouldn't  automatically  trigger any 911 calls.

Overall, my installation experience was really positive. That  said, AT&T and the installers knew they were working with CNET, so  it wasn't exactly a blind test. They made sure to optimize the strength  of every signal before they finished installing. They said they would do  that for everyone, but, as with any national service provider with  regional installation teams, your mileage may vary depending on who  actually comes out to your house, how busy they are that particular day,  etc.

Essentially, our setup looks like this: we have the basic ""Smart Security"" gadgets like motion and contact sensors, a siren, and a keypad. But we also invested in an extra motion detector, a smoke detector, a CO sensor, a glass-break sensor, a thermostat, two smart door locks, two garage door controllers, two cameras and four smart plugs. We opted out of the water sensors since we already had those covered. Our personalized package would actually cost $5/mo less than the ""Premium Security and Automation"" package, but its install price would be much higher, especially given the extra camera and lock.

The cameras and garage door controllers both need to be plugged into power outlets, but everything else is battery powered, and all of those devices talk wirelessly to the main controller box AT&T installed in a closet in the house. Such wireless installations are common among contract providers.

When it comes to the particular devices, AT&T Digital Life takes advantage of its third-party partnerships, which results in a hit-or-miss effect. The great products like the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro, for instance, stand out against more mediocre fare like the wonky tablet or the generic thermostat.

AT&T is developing partnerships to expand and strengthen its current lineup of individual products, though. Qualcomm, Lutron Electronics, Samsung, and Nest are already partners, and according to AT&T, Nest Learning Thermostat integration should be coming as early as Q1 2016. This should help raise the level of consistency among the devices.

The two devices I liked most, aside from the Samsung camera, were the smart plugs and the Yale Touchscreen Deadbolt. The plugs are  surprisingly well designed. Although they don't boast the hardware to  measure energy consumption, like the iDevices Switch or the Belkin WeMo Insight Switch,  they have something no other decent indoor switch does: two outlets. I  know -- that sounds insignificant. But it's actually really helpful to  have an ""always-on"" outlet and a remote controllable outlet.

The Yale Deadbolt, like the Samsung camera, has been a standalone product for some time. I liked it as its own device, but it works even better as part of the Digital Life system. For instance, not only can you give personalized entry codes to friends or family like before -- now you can ""Program"" those individual codes so they trigger different device commands inside the house. Check out the program I made for delivery people in the screenshot below.

Overall, I like most of the products, but there was one notable  stinker: the ZTE tablet. This device is featured in both the mid- and  high-level packages, and it's terrible. The interface is at once more  simplistic and more unresponsive than the app and the online portal  interfaces. Half the time I used the tablet, I turned it off because  it froze on the loading screen. In the end, I  started to pull out my phone instead of using the tablet as a result of its wonky touchscreen controls and limited capabilities.

I also noticed some  semifrequent latency when I sent commands to the system via the app or the AT&T website, called the online portal. To be clear, the sheer number of devices we've installed in  the CNET Smart Home creates a very busy testing  environment in terms of wireless reception. I don't want to ding anything unfairly for poor  responsiveness when it's simply a result of the noise in the house.

But after having a technician optimize all of the Digital Life  connections, when he later walked me through the app, he didn't seem bothered  when we experienced some commands lagging for 10 or 15 seconds. Although I haven't seen any home automation system accomplish totally smooth remote access, my experience with the Digital Life system underscores a  common complaint with these products. Sometimes, it's just faster to  walk over and flip the light switch manually.

Despite its minor latency issues, the real star of Digital Life's system is the online interface -- both through the phone app and the Digital Life online portal. They're both organized and intuitive. User sharing is simple: you just share an account. And anyone with the account information can do automation, like scheduling commands or setting up triggered ""Programs."" The two downsides are that you have to sign into the app every time you want to use it (why no simple keypad sign-in like with ADT Pulse?). And you can't create accounts with varying levels of access (think: kids can control the lights, but not the water valves). Neither of these shortcomings is detrimental, but each mars the app's otherwise clever design.

The coolest element in the app and the online portal is the ""Programs"" feature. Essentially, you can make any input into any gadget trigger any output from any other gadget. I'm not a programmer, but as soon as I figured out the system, I had a ball creating programs. I created one that, when I set AT&T Digital Life on Away Armed mode, locked my doors (after an appropriate delay), set my thermostat to drift a little (to save money), and turned off all my plugged-in lamps. When I unlock the front door, all these devices go back to normal.

I can see plenty of creative users building cool programs -- and the possibilities will only expand as the roster of equipment does. One expansion coming in the near future is voice recognition and automation. According to AT&T, this technology is in a trial stage right now. If it works well, it could push Digital Life ahead of most of its competitors.

Finally, I also really like the Digital Life website interface for buying additional products to add to your system. This is important, since -- for security reasons -- you can't buy your own products from whomever you want. With the flexible purchasing system, you can personalize your system and also your bill.

This is the big question, and the answer depends on what you need. At the CNET Smart Home, AT&T Digital Life worked really well -- the relatively large house felt integrated and secure. Sure, it didn't make the home feel super futuristic, but it was an effective system.

The basic $40/mo ""Smart Security"" package is competitively priced and well-designed. The $65/mo ""Premium Security and Automation"" package is a treasure trove of equipment and has a bright future. The only package I can comfortably advise against is the $55 ""Smart Security and Automation"" package, which simply costs too much more than the basic package for too few added features -- especially when one of those features is the useless tablet.

But bottom line, AT&T Digital Life is a slick system. For apartments or small houses, a DIY security system might be more appropriate. But anyone considering home security and automation should examine Digital Life closely. And for those hesitant to invest in a two-year contract now, Digital Life will be a system to watch, especially for its developing technology partnerships and growing automation features."
Lifx Color 1000 review:|"

For years, Philips Hue's high-profile connected LEDs have been the color-changing smart bulbs to beat.

Well, the Lifx Color 1000 beats them.

Lifx is brighter than Philips Hue. It's more efficient. It puts out more accurate colors. It boasts the better app of the two. It also closes the gap with Philips' third-party dominance by featuring compatibility with IFTTT, the Nest Learning Thermostat, and the Amazon Echo smart speaker, among others. Unlike Philips Hue's Zigbee bulbs, Lifx bulbs communicate using Wi-Fi, which means that they don't need a hub -- and that you don't need to purchase a $200 starter kit in order to buy in.

At $60 each (about £40, or a little over AU$80), Lifx bulbs are still awfully expensive -- perhaps prohibitively so. I know I'm still holding out for the cost of color-changing connected light to come down. Still, if I were buying in today, the Lifx Color 1000 is almost certainly the bulb I'd go with.

The Lifx Color 1000 looks like a more compact version of the original Lifx LED. It's the same flat-topped build as before, but roughly half an inch shorter, and with about 2 ounces less heft. It also uses less energy -- 11 watts at peak brightness, as opposed to 17 watts from the original.

In spite of this, the new Lifx manages to put out more light than before. When we tested out its brightest setting (the default, a soft white 3,500 K), the original clocked in at 956 lumens. As its name might suggest, the Lifx Color 1000 bumps that number up above 1,000 lumens. With more light from less energy, it's a clear step forward from generation one and a very efficient lighting option that emits over 90 lumens per watt at peak settings. By comparison, Philips Hue's newest bulbs put out less than 75 lumens per watt (734 lumens of light output at their brightest setting from a power draw of 10 watts).

The Lifx app offers sixteen separate white-light settings ranging from 2,500 to 9,000 K. If you dial the color temperature up or down from the default 3,500 K setting, the brightness drops off a bit. This fall is a bit more pronounced than it was in generation one, where the warmest and coolest settings -- 2,500 K and 9,000 K -- are actually slightly brighter than what you see in generation two. That tells me that the second-gen bulb is more specifically calibrated around that default setting and designed to optimize brightness at 3,500 K while still using less energy.

One other note -- I appreciated that the Lifx Color 1000 was designed in such a way that the default setting is the brightest part of the spectrum. This isn't the case with Philips Hue, where the sweet spot in the white light spectrum sits at about 4,000 K -- a different color temperature than the bulb's default.

Still, the Lifx Color 1000 isn't a perfect design. The flat-topped bulb doesn't protrude any further than the width of its base, which keeps it from casting as much light downward as it does upward (I had a similar qualm with the Misfit Bolt LED). Lifx makes up for it somewhat by being a much brighter option overall, but I still would have appreciated a more omnidirectional design.

You'll dial between those white light settings using the Lifx app on your Android or iOS device. A quick tap on the ""Colors"" button switches you over to a full RGB color wheel -- rotate your shade of choice to the top, and the bulb will change colors accordingly.

There are a couple of things I like about this approach. First, with a color wheel, it's easy to turn the specific shade you want to the top. With competitors like Philips Hue and Misfit Bolt, you pick your color by dragging a little light bulb icon over a specific part of a full-screen spectrum. It looks nice, but it's a bit of a pain in practice -- your finger inevitably blocks the part of spectrum you're aiming for, making it tough to see which shade you're actually selecting.

I also like the specificity that comes with the Lifx approach. Each of those 16 white-light settings are labeled by color temperature. With the colors, each shade is marked as a specific degree of the circle. In both cases, it's easy to come back to your exact shade of choice. None of the competitors label the colors in their spectrums like that -- if you want to return to an exact shade, you're forced to approximate it.

The only downside to the color wheel approach is that you can only select one color at a time. With Philips or Misfit, you can change the colors of more than one bulb by dragging bulb icons to multiple parts of the spectrum on a single screen. With Lifx, you can group bulbs together and change them in tandem, but you'll need to change them one at a time if you want them to shine in different colors.

Tapping on ""Themes"" brings up a list of preset color cycles that are similar to what you'll find on the home screen of the Misfit Bolt app. Each one is tied to an emotion like ""Cheerful"" or ""Exciting,"" and paired with a colorful icon that gives you a good sense of the variety of tones that will be included. I liked that feature as a no-fuss way to pick out a color cycle for Misfit Bolt, and I like it here with Lifx, too.

You'll find a couple of gimmicky extras in the ""Effects"" section of the Lifx app. These include a mode that mimics a flickering candle, a mode that cycles through random colors, and a press-to-strobe function. Most of them offer a good deal of additional settings to help you tweak the effect to your liking.

There's also a music visualizer that can sync lighting changes in rhythm with whatever music you're playing. This is always a fun feature to break out at parties, but you'll want to note that Lifx does it a little differently. Most smart bulbs will sync the lights with whatever music is streaming out of your device, but Lifx instead uses your phone's microphone to sync with the sound going in. This works well enough if you're playing music on your phone itself, but if you're playing music on a separate sound system, you'll need to leave your phone next to the speakers in order for the effect to work.

The other feature worth talking about is scheduling. When it first launched, Lifx didn't offer a way to program your bulbs to turn on and off at specific times -- something I criticized when I first reviewed the original bulb. In response, Lifx added a channel on the online automation service IFTTT, and pointed out that you could use IFTTT to schedule lighting changes (in addition to lots of other things).

This was a nice step forward, but I was still unimpressed with the lack of scheduling capabilities in the Lifx app itself. Fortunately, Lifx has since updated its app to fix that problem, adding in a very nice scheduling feature that offers in-depth, easy-to-use controls for automated lighting. I especially like that you can program how long you want it to take for your lights to fade on. Stretching that period out for a few minutes or longer is a great way to simulate a sunrise and help ease you out of bed in the morning.

Lifx has also done a good job of continuing to integrate with notable third-party services and devices. Along with adding Cortana-powered support for PCs and devices running Windows 10, Lifx works with notable names like the Nest Learning Thermostat, the SmartThings connected home platform, the Logitech Harmony Hub, and the Amazon Echo smart speaker, which offers another way to control Lifx bulbs using spoken commands. That last bit helps Lifx compete with the Apple HomeKit-compatible Hue bulbs, which work with Siri.

The Echo integration was easy to set up when I tested it out -- just open the ""Skills"" section of the Alexa app and give Amazon access to your Lifx login info. From there, you'll be able to control your bulbs by talking to Alexa. It's a bit clunkier than I'd like, though. After saying ""Alexa"" to wake the speaker up, you have to say ""ask Lifx"" to activate the Lifx skill, followed by your actual command. So, a full command might sound like: ""Alexa...ask Lifx to dim the bedroom lamp to 10 percent.""

Still, it worked reliably well, and it let me switch to specific colors, too -- which you still can't do with Philips Hue's Echo integration. That one's a bit of a head-scratcher, as Hue was one of the very first products to team up with Amazon Echo. Despite the head start, Echo can still only turn Hue bulbs on and off, or dim them up and down.

So, the specs are strong, the app is impressive...how about those colors, though?

From the beginning, color quality has been one of Lifx' strong suits, and things are no different with the Color 1000. In fact, the specific color tones are practically indistinguishable from what you'll see with the first-gen bulb. That's a good thing -- the first-gen bulb's colors were spot on.

Each color tone I tested out was vivid and relatively bright, with no real weak spots to speak of. As we've seen before, Lifx does an especially good job producing a bright, true shade of green, a color that Philips Hue struggles with, even in its second generation. It's also able to produce a striking, icy, cyan-colored tone, a color that Philips Hue flat out whiffs on due to its limited number of blue diodes. Lifx is also a much, much brighter option than the Misfit Bolt, which looks downright dim when you turn the two on side by side.

Like Misfit, Lifx relegates the colored diodes to the bottom 50 percent of the bulb's brightness scale. Dial Lifx up above fifty percent, and it'll start adding in the white diodes. This desaturates the colors and produces bright, tinted white light, which actually works well for more practical and subtle lighting applications.

Among color-changing smart bulbs, the Lifx Color 1000 is the brightest and the most efficient. Its colors hit the mark across the spectrum. Its app is the most fully-featured and easy to use. It boasts a number of useful third party integrations with popular products and services -- enough to put this bulb on the same level as the very well connected Philips Hue LEDs. It won't work with Apple HomeKit (or with Siri) the way that Philips Hue bulbs will, but integrations with Alexa and Cortana help close the gap.

At $60 each, Lifx bulbs definitely aren't cheap. If you're just looking to try out a bulb or two for a Halloween party, you're probably better off with something like Misfit Bolt, which sells for almost half of what Lifx costs. On the other hand, if you're looking to go all-in and fill a large home with dozens of smart lights, you might prefer a system like Philips Hue that doesn't rely on your Wi-Fi network, and uses its own dedicated Zigbee signal, instead.

Still, I think there's an awfully big middle ground between those two extremes. If that's where you're at, then Lifx is almost certainly your best option."
Pantelligent review:|"

Editors' note, April 13, 2016: The company behind the Pantelligent has added an Autopilot feature to the smart frying pan's app. We tested the feature and updated the review below.

During my first attempt to pan-grill chicken breasts, I called my mother for some culinary advice. ""How do you know when the chicken is done?"" I asked. ""Just cook it till it's done,"" she said. And that is how I learned to cook, with a hearty helping of guesswork and intuition.

I can only imagine what those first meals in my first apartment would have tasted like if I'd had the Pantelligent, a $199 smart frying pan that uses a built-in temperature gauge, Bluetooth and an iOS- and Android-compatible app to guide you to cooking perfection. The price converts roughly to £140 in the UK and AU$285 in Australia. The Pantelligent helped me produce perfectly seared salmon, buttery grilled-cheese sandwiches and a decent mushroom risotto by providing real-time feedback on the surface temperature of food so I could adjust my burner accordingly.

The connectivity also made cooking a lot of fun. The app talks you through each step like a gentle coach and sends encouraging pop-up alerts when you've gotten the Pantelligent to the right temperature for you dish. But the app's reminders can become annoying until you get the hang of adjusting your burner; this robotic assistant shifts from helpful to burdensome if the proper temperature isn't reached quickly enough.

Since I initially got my hands on the Pantelligent, its developers have added an Autopilot feature to the app that makes controlling the heat a hands-off experience -- as long as you have a WeMo Switch and a countertop electric burner.

The smart outlet, the app and the Pantelligent do the heavy lifting of adjusting the burner temperature, and you only need to step in to flip, stir or remove your food from the pan.

It seems silly to want to put down 200 bucks for an aluminum pan, especially when you can snag this cookware for less than $20. But the Pantelligent is a good teacher for the novice newbies who need help with the basics and avid home cooks who want to add more precision to their meal preparation. It might be a little gimmicky and a lot of money, but I can't help but want a Pantelligent of my own.

The Pantelligent launched as a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014; backers pledged $83,206 toward the creation of the pan (the project's original fundraising goal was $30,000). The manufacturer began to ship units to supporters in October 2015, and it's now available for order on the Pantelligent website (there's a backlog until February 2016, but Pantelligent is offering $25 off for the delay).

At first glance, the Pantelligent doesn't look much different than cookware you already own. The pan is 12 inches wide and about 2 inches deep. It's made of die-cast aluminum and covered in nonstick coating that the company says should last about three to five years. The finish makes cleaning the Pantelligent easy, and that's a good thing: you can't put the pan in the dishwasher or submerge the handle in water.

The hardware that makes the Pantelligent smart is hidden inside the pan. A sensor embedded in the bottom of the pan measures the surface temperature of food. The pan then uses a Bluetooth connection in the handle to deliver data to the Pantelligent app (the handle is also where the two AAA batteries that power the unit are located).

The Pantelligent is safe to use on both gas and electric cooktops. The material, however, does not work on induction surfaces.

There are several ways that the Pantelligent app uses temperature readings from the pan to guide you through a meal. The best way to use the app is to select and follow one of the recipes available on the app. All of the roughly 50 recipes provide thorough lists of ingredients and things to remember while you cook along with any preparatory steps you need to complete before you begin to cook. When you're ready, you press the ""Start Cooking"" button at the bottom of the page and hold your device to the Pantelligent's handle to connect the cookware to the app.

From that point on, the Pantelligent app is the conductor of your meal. A Siri-like voice talks you through the recipe, which is also displayed step-by-step on your device. A chart at the top of the screen tracks the actual surface temperature of the pan and the set temperature you need to reach. Each step also includes an estimate of how long it will take you to get to that part of the recipe, which is especially helpful when cooking a recipe that requires you to add ingredients gradually.

The goal is to maintain a steady temperature, and the Pantelligent is accurate in its directions to turn the heat up or down. If the pan gets too hot or too cold, an alert pops up on the screen to let you know to adjust your burner accordingly. But the directions get annoying, especially when the surface temperature doesn't decrease as quickly as the Pantelligent would like. Several times while cooking steak and salmon, the Pantelligent would repeatedly tell me to turn the heat down, even though the chart showed that the temperature was dropping (albeit slowly) and the burner was already on its lowest setting.

Another downside of the Pantelligent app's instructions are its units of measurement by which it tells you to adjust the temperature. The app will tell you to turn the heat up or down ""a lot"" or ""a bit,"" directions that could mean different things to different people using different cooktops. The ambiguity forces you to really get to know your appliance and how sensitive it is to burner adjustments. Be prepared to mess around with your burner knobs a lot until you get comfortable with the Pantelligent.

Pantelligent's user manual recommends that you cook salmon as your first dish with the smart pan. After I slid a beautiful, brown-crusted filet onto a plate, it was easy to see why the company pushes salmon as your introductory Pantelligent meal. The salmon had a seared crust and was cooked to medium throughout the filet. Two folks in the office who don't care much for salmon both admitted that it was a pretty good fish.

I used this recipe to cook salmon in a pan with similar specs to the Pantelligent: 12 inches across, nonstick and aluminum. Most recipes call for cooking a piece of salmon skin side down for the majority of cooking, then briefly cooking on the skinless side for a final sear. This is the exact opposite of the Pantelligent, which wants you to cook the skinless side for a longer period of time over a consistent temperature. With the regular pan, it was hard to tell when it was time to flip the fish because of the white albumin that started to seep from the sides of the filet. The salmon ended up being unevenly cooked -- nearly rare on the skin side, but medium on the other side.

The salmon illustrates how well the Pantelligent can take a simple recipe you might already know and perfect it. The app is also helpful in whipping up a new-to-you recipe. I used the app to make mushroom risotto, a dish I've always been too intimidated to try. The multistep recipe was pretty involved, especially the parts when you have to add beef broth every three minutes or so. The risotto had a great flavor, but was a little more al dente than I would've liked (there was some extra broth left after I had finished, so there may have been some user error on my part). The app gave me the confidence and guidance to try something new.

The Pantelligent app's other cooking settings are the Freestyle Mode, which enables you to track the pan's temperature and set your own preferred temperature goal, and Create Recipe in which you cook your own recipe and the app records the temperature for future reference. These both provide some great flexibility for cooking without the app's recipes, but they require you to learn more about surface temperatures in your recipe. I've never seen a recipe that tells you what the surface temperature of your food should be throughout cooking, so you'll have to do some experimentation.

If the Pantelligent app was the gentle cooking tutor, the Autopilot is the expert who pushes you out of the way to show you how it's really done. After you've enabled Autopilot in the app's preferences, here's how it works: Get an electric countertop burner (we used this one) and plug it into a WeMo Switch, a smart, Wi-Fi-connected power plug that lets you automate whatever you put into it. Place the Pantelligent on the burner and select a recipe in the app as you normally would. The app will ask you if you want to enable Autopilot, then remind you to connect your burner to your WeMo Switch and turn the burner onto its maximum setting. With Autopilot in play, you don't have to manually adjust the heat: the WeMo Switch will automatically turn the burner off and on based on Pantelligent's surface temperature readings.

I barely heard from the Pantelligent as I cooked multiple pieces of salmon. If the Pantelligent was too hot, the burner turned off. If it was too low, the burner came back on. I only stepped in when it was time to turn the salmon and remove it when cooking was complete. I've never felt more useless in the kitchen than when I used the Autopilot.

I was amazed at how accurately the WeMo Switch and the Pantelligent app worked together to regulate temperature. If you're a bad cook, this automated temperature control could be a godsend. It would also be useful if you need to work on other parts of your meal while your main dish cooks in the Pantelligent. But the need to buy extra equipment to enable this feature is a ding against Autopilot, especially on top of the $199 Pantelligent. And I'm concerned that such a hands-off style of cooking could encourage careless cooking behavior, such as folks leaving the kitchen entirely while their meal cooks. But this addition is promising for the future of automated cooking.

At first, it was a little unsettling to use the Pantelligent -- I looked at my phone more than I looked at the food I was cooking, an action that can usually spell trouble. Yet I felt pretty safe about the test kitchen not catching on fire because I was paying such close attention to the burner knob and making adjustments. The Bluetooth has a decent range, but I didn't want to venture too far away from the cooktop. The Pantelligent makes you want study every step of your cooking and learn just what makes this pan and its app work so well.

Though the improv and intuitiveness that cooking usually requires is missing when you use the Pantelligent, you are instead treated to a very precise cooking tool that teaches you the importance of maintaining a steady temperature no matter what you cook. There might not be any guesswork, but there's a lot of enjoyment in cooking with the Pantelligent."
Misfit Bolt review:|"

In Misfit's product catalog, the color-changing Bolt Bluetooth smart bulb looks to be, well, a bit of a misfit. After all, this is a company that's best known for its wearable tech -- what the heck is a light bulb doing in the mix?

Look a little closer and you'll see why Misfit Bolt makes sense. Pair it up with your phone over Bluetooth, and you'll be able to control and adjust your lighting by using an app -- or by using its integration with Misfit's activity trackers. You can also sync Bolt up with your sleep patterns and program it to wake you up in the morning with a gradual sunrise simulation -- a nice companion piece for anyone who tracks their sleep using a Misfit wearable, or with Misfit's Beddit sleep monitor.

Currently selling on Misfit's website for $43, the Misfit Bolt isn't a bad deal compared with pricier competitors like the $60 Lifx LED. You also don't need a hub plugged into your router in order to sync your phone with it, which makes it an easier option to get started with than something like Philips Hue.

That said, Bolt isn't as bright as either of those options, and it isn't as fully featured, either. You can't sync it up with your music, nor can you control it through a system like IFTTT or Amazon Echo. For basic color-changing smart functionality, it does a fine job, but the competition feels further ahead.

The Misfit Bolt stands out for its distinctive design, with a metallic black base built from neatly spiraling heat sinks. It's heavy, weighing just under half a pound, and it feels expensive and luxurious in your hand, in case that's the sort of thing that factors into your light bulb buying decisions.

Of course, hidden under a lampshade, the only design factor that really matters is how the light looks. In this sense, the Misfit Bolt might leave you underwhelmed. With a dome-shaped bulb that doesn't bulge out any further than the base does, the light is non-omnidirectional. That means that it if you screw it into a table lamp, it'll send most of its light up and out. That isn't ideal if you're trying to read beneath it.

The bulb also defaults to a dimmer-than-you-might-like soft white setting of about 600 lumens. You can dial it up to the claimed 800-lumen light output if you pull out the app, but that's a clear annoyance if you put a premium on brightness.

The app itself makes a better first impression. It's slick and colorful, with attractive tiles for a wide range of color-changing presets -- everything from ""Forest,"" which cycles through green tones, to ""Volcano,"" which offers a mix of reds, pinks and oranges. Scroll down through those preset options, and you'll notice a dynamic parallax effect to the imagery. It's a stylish look, with plenty of polish.

It's a different approach than most other smart color-changers, which tend to keep those color cycles relegated to a special features section of the app (if they offer them at all). Misfit puts them front and center, pitching them not as an extra feature, but as the primary use case. I can see the appeal -- for some users, selecting a specific mood made of a mix of colors will seem a lot simpler than picking out an exact shade on a full-spectrum color selector.

Mind you, Misfit won't stop you from fidgeting with a full spectrum of colors. Tap the little plus sign on the home screen, and you'll be able to go into color mode, where a rainbow-hued ocean of pixels awaits, complete with a white-light spectrum on top. Drag the little light bulb icon representing your Misfit Bolt over the color of your choice, and presto, the bulb will change color accordingly.

It's almost exactly the same as the color selection spectrum in the Philips Hue app. I don't like it there, and I don't like it here, either. It's a pain trying to dial in to an exact shade, especially since your finger will block your view as you drag that bulb icon around. I much prefer the Lifx approach, which spreads that spectrum around a color wheel, then lets you pick a specific shade by rotating it to the top. Even better, Lifx labels each color as a specific degree in the circle. That makes it easy to return to your exact shade of choice.

Beyond the preset color cycles and the full spectrum color selector, you can also pick a color from one of the photos on your phone, or set the bulb to turn on and off automatically as you come in and out of Bluetooth range. This last bit wasn't terribly useful when I tested it out -- the bulb turns off reliably enough, but has trouble turning back on when you come back into range. In fairness, Misfit still lists this as a beta feature, so perhaps after some more fine-tuning it'll work a little better.

Other features are aimed more at syncing with your sleep schedule. For instance, you can put the bulb on a sleep timer and set it to gradually fade out over a predetermined length of time, or program the ""Sunrise"" preset to wake you up with some artificial morning light at the time of your choice.

Both features work well, but if you're hoping for any sort of additional scheduling, you'll be disappointed. Also missing: a music syncing feature. Almost every other smart bulb offers some way to get the lights flashing in rhythm with your party mix -- especially the ones that pair directly with your phone. Misfit does not, which seems like a missed opportunity.

The other omission separating Misfit Bolt from the majority of the competition is a lack of integrations with outside platforms. For instance, you can't sync the bulbs up with the Amazon Echo smart speaker to enable voice activated lighting changes, the way you can with both Lifx and Philips Hue. You won't find support for platforms like Apple HomeKit, either.

As color-changing bulbs go, Misfit Bolt gets arguably the most important part -- the colors -- right. When I tested the bulb out in our integrating sphere and spectrometer setup, each of the major shades tested well for accuracy, including green, a color that Philips Hue bulbs struggle with.

The brightness of those colors was less impressive. Like with Lifx, the bulb starts adding white light when you dial up past 50 percent brightness, and at full brightness, those tinted tones were plenty bright. But back at 50 percent, where you get those pure, saturated colors, things were noticeably dimmer than what you'll get from the competition.

Compared with the first-generation Lifx bulb, this largely comes down to the power draw. At 17 watts, the first-gen Lifx was plenty powerful, enough so to call itself a 75W replacement. The Misfit Bolt draws 13 watts, and only gets up into 60W replacement territory at specific parts of the spectrum.

It's worth noting, though, that Lifx cleaned house on its stock of first-gen bulbs over Black Friday, just as it began ramping up sales of its second-gen bulb, the Lifx Color 1000. That bulb only draws 11 watts, but still claims to put out more light than the Misfit Bolt. We'll be reviewing it later this month.

Misfit Bolt's overall dimness leads me to say that the bulb isn't a great pick for anything more than an accent light. That seems to be Misfit's intention here, seeing as how the bulb is prominently geared for a bedside table lamp with its sleep timer and Sunset mode. However, that only calls the non-omnidirectional build back into question. Something omnidirectional would have been a much better fit, especially for anyone who likes to read in bed.

While I had the Misfit Bolt screwed into our integrating sphere, I made sure to also test out how well it dims. The result was a good one. Using the app, it dims cleanly down to about 7 percent before shutting off. Anything below 10 percent is a success in my book, though it's worth noting that Philips Hue bulbs are able to dim down below 1 percent.

I also took a look at how well those spiraling heat sinks help the bulb manage heat. All LEDs will see their brightness dip by about 10 or 15 percent as they heat up, and Misfit is no different. The dip should stop at the bulb's ""steady state"" after about an hour (this steady state is where manufacturers rate the bulbs for brightness, and where we test them, too, so you aren't getting shortchanged on the lumen listing.)

With Misfit Bolt, though, it took about 90 minutes before the bulb finally leveled out. That's an acceptable result, but not as good as we've seen with other LEDs. The practical takeaway is that it probably isn't the best bet for an enclosed fixture, where heat gets trapped.

Misfit Bolt isn't the best color-changing bulb I've tested out, but at a retail price below $50, I think it deserves consideration, especially for anyone who just wants a fun, colorful novelty light. For the most part, the app is terrific and easy to use, and the colors the bulb puts out are true. It'd be even better with a music syncing feature, but that isn't a deal breaker in my eyes.

Still, Bolt isn't as bright or as fully featured as competitors like Lifx, iLumi and Philips Hue, and its limited Bluetooth range isn't as appealing as the Lifx Wi-Fi approach. With second-gen Lifx bulbs starting to hit store shelves, I think you'll want to do a close comparison between the two before making a purchase. We'll be doing our own when we test out the Lifx Color 1000 -- look for that review in the coming weeks."
Nanoleaf Smarter Kit review:|"

Nanoleaf's Smarter Kit is the latest connected home offering to support Apple HomeKit, the set of smart-home control protocols programmed into the iPhone and iPad. Screw the funky-looking lights in and sync them up with Nanoleaf's dodecahedron-shaped hub, and you'll be able to control them alongside  	other HomeKit-compatible devices, or dim the bulbs up and down using your phone. And, thanks to HomeKit, you'll be able to tell Siri to turn them on and off, as well.

The two-bulb Nanoleaf kit sells online for $100 (converted roughly, about £65, or AU$140), which is a lot to spend on smart bulbs that don't change colors or color temperatures. For comparison, the non-color-changing version of Philips Hue's starter kit, which is also HomeKit compatible, costs $80, while the non-HomeKit compatible WeMo LED Starter Set is down to just $50. Nanoleaf's bulbs are pricey, too -- extras will set you back $25 a piece, compared with the $15 you'll spend for the white-light-only Hue bulbs, or for generic Zigbee bulbs like the Cree Connected LED and the GE Link LED.

Nanoleaf's hub can actually control some of those cheaper third-party bulbs as well, and the eye-catching design of both the bulbs and the hub might be enough to tempt you to buy in. I'd consider waiting, though. As of now, you can't schedule automated lighting changes in Nanoleaf's app, and there isn't an easy way to sync the bulbs up with things like motion detectors. Android users will have to wait a bit, too. For now, the Nanoleaf bulbs are iOS only, though the company is also an Early Access Partner for Google Weave, which Nanoleaf tells me should bring Android support into the picture sometime in early 2016. Until then, I say keep these bulbs on your watch list.

The top selling point for this lighting kit over other lighting kits like it is that it looks darned cool. Like  	the Nanoleaf bulbs that came before them, the Nanoleaf Ivy smart bulbs are 3D-printed jigsaw assemblies with light-emitting diodes on the outside. It's a unique and geeky aesthetic, but it has a practical purpose, too -- each of those 3D-printed pieces helps conduct heat away from the diodes that sit on them.

The system's hub -- a black dodecahedron with a glowing pentagonal ring of white LEDs on top -- looks just as unique as the bulbs. It's a refreshing design choice, as most smart home hubs are ugly plastic pucks that you end up stashing out of sight. With Nanoleaf, you can leave the hub out in full display to help class your place up a tad.

The app is less of a design standout, and sticks to a more traditional approach. It looks fine and it's simple enough to use, but it isn't quite as polished as some of the other HomeKit apps we've tested out.

To get started, you'll open the app and plug in your hub. The app will scan for it and ask for its HomeKit pairing code. Once you snap a picture of that code or enter it manually, you'll be up and running.

Next, you'll add your lights. This is one of the small points where the app lacks polish, as there's no way to start the pairing process in the app, and no explanation of how to add bulbs at all. You'll need to pull out the instruction booklet to find that you scan for bulbs by tapping on the top of the hub. It's not a huge deal, but adding those instructions into the app would have been helpful.

With my bulbs turned on, the hub scanned for them and added them to my setup in less than a minute. The app gives you the option of renaming each one, which you'll definitely want to do -- those names are what Siri will use to identify each bulb. You can't, however, change the device's icon. Each light gets the same little Nanoleaf-y bulb designation, regardless of what type of bulb it actually is.

This isn't quite ideal, since Nanoleaf's hub can control third-party bulbs. For my tests, I used a Cree Connected LED and a GE Link LED, both of which cost $10 less than the Nanoleaf Ivy LED. Each one paired on the first try, and worked fine as I tested them out, but the option to customize their icons to designate them as non-Nanoleaf bulbs would have been a nice touch.

Still, with the third-party bulbs, Nanoleaf gets the important stuff right. Each one worked in tandem with Nanoleaf's bulbs, and each one worked well with Siri, too. That last bit is an important contrast with Philips Hue. Though Hue's platform has long supported third-party bulbs, it doesn't share its HomeKit compatibility with them. We've got several Cree Connected LEDs paired with a HomeKit-compatible Philips Hue Bridge in the CNET Smart Home -- we can control them through the Hue app, but we can't control them with Siri commands.

The app allows you to group lights by room per HomeKit's standards. By doing so, I was able to group a Nanoleaf bulb, a Cree bulb, and a GE bulb together in one room, then tell Siri to dim them all up and down at the same time. It worked well, though the bulbs dim at slightly different speeds, which caused a fraction of a second's worth of delay between each one.

With the Nanoleaf bulbs, you can also dim each light manually using the light switch -- the same trick we saw with the Nanoleaf Bloom. Here's how it works. When you first switch a Nanoleaf bulb on, it'll slowly dim up to full brightness over the course of a few seconds. At any point during that fade, you can lock in the brightness level by flicking the switch off and on in quick succession.

If you flick the switch off and on when the bulb's at full brightness, it will slowly fade down -- you'll lock it in by flicking the switch off and on once more. Finally, if the bulb is off, you can turn it on in a dimmed down nightlight mode by flicking the switch three times -- on, off, on. All of that takes some getting used to, but it's an admittedly handy feature -- and one that you won't find with other smart bulbs.

Still, there are some key smart lighting features that you won't find with Nanoleaf -- namely, a function for scheduling automated lighting changes. That's a pretty big omission -- scheduling lights to turn on automatically when you wake up, when the sun sets, or when you're away on vacation is basically Connected Lighting 101. With iOS 9, HomeKit products are supposed to be able to offer these sorts of functions, but we haven't seen any of them do so yet.

Nanoleaf tells us that additional functions are on the way. In addition to deeper integration with HomeKit, Nanoleaf plans to add in support for geofenced lighting automations that turn bulbs on and off automatically as you come and go. We'll keep an eye out for their arrival, and update this piece accordingly when they get here.

Smart functions aside, these are still light bulbs we're talking about -- so are they any good? And will the weird design affect the quality of light in your home?

The answer to that last question is no. Beneath a lampshade, the bulbs cast the same sort of even, omnidirectional light as you'd expect from a more traditionally shaped light source. That makes them a solid pick for just about any common household fixture, except for recessed fixtures, where you'll be much better off with a non-omnidirectional floodlight.

Nanoleaf claims that the Ivy bulbs put out 800 lumens of brightness from a power draw of 7.5 watts. That power draw checked out in my tests, but the brightness claim did not. Instead, the bulb clocked in at closer to 700 lumens. It's not a hugely noticeable difference, but it's something to be aware of before buying in, especially if brightness is especially important to you.

The rest of the specs held up fine. I was especially impressed with how efficient these bulbs are. With 700 lumens from 7.5 watts, the bulbs put out about 94 lumens per watt -- a better number than any of the other smart bulbs we've tested thus far. Use the Nanoleaf bulbs an average of 3 hours per day, and each one will add less than a dollar to your energy bill -- per year.

The Nanoleaf bulbs also impressed me with their perfect dimming capabilities. While most dimmable LEDs will only dim down to a certain point before the light drops out, the Nanoleaf bulbs will dim smoothly down to zero. That combines nicely with the manual-dimming feature to make this bulb an excellent pick for anyone who likes the lights down low.

As for color temperature, the Nanoleaf bulbs are slightly cooler and less yellowy than most of the ""soft white"" options out there, coming in just shy of a stated 3,000 K. If you want something more akin to daylight, you'll need to look elsewhere, as Nanoleaf doesn't offer any higher color temperature bulbs, nor does it currently offer a color tunable bulb.

That might change soon, though. Nanoleaf CEO Gimmy Chu tells me that Nanoleaf bulbs with full color-changing functionality are in the works for early next year, though he cautions that they'll likely look a bit different than the Ivy bulbs. ""We'll need to do adequate color mixing in order for it to look nice, but we have a cool design that will still accommodate the A19 size constraints,"" Chu said.

Also in the works:  support for a greater number of smart-home platforms. In addition to plans to expand HomeKit functionality and to jump in with Google Weave, Chu tells me that support for voice control through the Amazon Echo smart speaker sits at the top of Nanoleaf's to-do list.

Nanoleaf's smart bulbs look terrific, they work well, and they boast a cool manual dimming feature that you won't find with any other app-enabled lights. But -- at least for the time being -- they're also tied strongly to Apple HomeKit, which right now still feels like a work in progress. You still can't schedule lighting changes, for instance, nor is there an easy way to sync your lights up with things like motion detectors.

All of that is supposed to change soon, but if you wanted to wait for it to happen before buying in, I wouldn't blame you one bit. Still, if you're bullish about HomeKit (or if you've already committed to building your smart home upon it), then these bulbs deserve your consideration."
Hiku Labs Hiku (2015) review:|"

Imagine an alternate reality in which you don't have to go grocery shopping. That's the future Hiku Labs is hoping to make possible with its second-generation Hiku, a shopping assistant available online at the Hiku Labs website for $50, or $80 after the December promotional period. Basically, the Hiku magnets to your fridge, and when you finish a jug of milk or another grocery, you scan its barcode before you toss it, and the item is added to your shopping list. With the original Hiku, that's where things ended. But now, thanks to partnerships with Walmart Online Grocery and Peapod's grocery delivery service, you can upload that list to an online system that will purchase and (with Peapod) even deliver your groceries.

Besides the minor hiccups I've come to expect from voice-activated devices, the Hiku works pretty well -- the second-generation device has certainly sharpened the design of the first. The app is functional, and compatible with iOS and Android. I just don't see Hiku streamlining the grocery-list process any more than a note on your phone already does. That said, the device, in combination with one of its two purchasing services, could really reduce the frustration of buying groceries for busy families and disabled persons.

In 2013 we reviewed the first-generation Hiku -- a clever grocery-list assistant that we decided was cool, but not worth its $80 price tag. Now, Hiku Labs has released the second-generation Hiku; the device is upgraded and its design has been sharpened. Both generations will get access to the also-new online grocery feature, but my first question is, what's new with the Hiku device itself?

The gen-2 Hiku's design is clever. At first glance, it just looks like a white plastic puck with a silver button on one side and a magnet on the other. But the design has been improved since the first generation: the body is sealed tighter to make it more liquid resistant, the button is responsive, protective rubber covers the edges of the scanning window. Overall, the device feels durable and stylish at once, and the unfinished look of some first-generation design features has been fixed.

The Hiku still attaches to most fridges (if you have a stainless-steel one, you're out of luck) allowing easy access in the kitchen. And whereas the first generation took a few seconds to wake up when you wanted to scan a product, this Hiku features an instant-on interface. This touch, while small, makes a big difference for usability: latency almost never gets in the way of efficient use.

I enjoy how the gen-2 Hiku looks and handles, but I don't like how it communicates. Like the first Hiku, when you scan something, the device will bleat either a low or high note, or it will make a bah-bah-bah noise. It's an unclear method of communication, and I only got a handle on it when I spent extended periods of time scanning groceries. Basically a low note means it didn't register the item, a higher note means it did register it, and the tri-note indicates that it registered, but didn't recognize the item (so you have to enter the app and type in the name).

The code sounds simple enough, but if I were scanning single items throughout the week, I'd probably forget which sound signaled what, and have to check my app to make sure the scans registered properly.

The Hiku is quick to set up and easy to use. No paper directions accompany the device; just a sticker that says, ""To get started, get the app."" And it really is that simple. The app walks you through the process of syncing the Hiku with your Wi-Fi network -- a process that involves light-blinked communication between your phone and the Hiku device. Within 5 minutes of opening the box, the Hiku should be ready to use.

Practically, the Hiku itself does two primary actions: it scans barcodes and it listens to you speak the names of items, like ""milk"" or ""eggs."" Then it logs those items into a list on the Hiku app. Both of these functions work pretty well. Besides the hiccups most of us have come to expect using Siri, Alexa, or any of the countless other voice systems on the market, the word recognition is pretty solid.

The scanning function is a little iffier. Big-brand products, like Kraft cheese, will scan without a problem. But if you shop at stores like Trader Joe's or Whole Foods that deal primarily in proprietary brands, the scanner's item-recognition is hit-or-miss. This is largely because Hiku depends on crowdsourced data for these items. So I got surprising precision on some items (""Trader Joe's 2008 Vintage Ale"") and enigmatic descriptions on others (""Trader joes greek strawberry yogurt and a couple for mommy too please"").

The app mostly operates as an information organizer; it's the pad of paper to your high-tech Hiku pen. You can scan items using your phone's camera, but the function is buried deep in the app interface, so you won't use it often. Instead, the biggest app addition -- available with both first- and second-generation Hikus -- is the ""Get it now"" feature. Using this feature, you can take advantage of Hiku Labs' partnership with Peapod and Walmart Online Grocery, two online grocery-shopping services.

This ""Get it now"" feature caught my attention when I first heard about the gen-2 Hiku. An $80 list-maker doesn't impress me much, but if that same device could facilitate grocery deliveries, it could be incredibly helpful for those who can't make it out of the house easily, or whose schedules make grocery runs tough.

I was a little disappointed to find that Hiku really doesn't do much in this regard, other than send you to the website of whichever service you're using and enter your grocery list into the site. But even the list entries are often imperfect. A bottle of agave syrup, for instance, was Walmart's suggested replacement for a bottle of Patrón Tequila.

The app also tells you how many of your items can be bought through the service you're using. The problem here is that it recognizes only some of the comparable products (Trader Joe's Greek Yogurt to Walmart-brand equivalent, but not Trader Joe's Peanut Butter).

The biggest question for me, regarding the Hiku's functions, is the necessity of the device itself. Especially in light of Amazon Dash, grocery delivery companies' expansion, and the potential for voice-activated technology like Siri and Alexa, smart online grocery shopping looks to be a burgeoning market. Hiku works pretty well, but what will it do in the future to distinguish itself from other potentially cheaper devices or apps?

Right now, you can buy the Hiku online for 50 bucks, which is a pretty solid deal. The real price, to be reinstated at the beginning of 2016, is $80. I don't like this price as much. For me, $50 is money you can lay down to crash test promising technology. Not $80, especially when it's a device whose primary function could theoretically be accomplished by the app alone (though ease of access on your fridge helps justify the Hiku in this regard).

And ultimately, the Hiku is mostly just promising. Sure, the second-generation Hiku has cut down on device-to-app communication latency. It has incorporated an instant-on feature. It has upgraded in plenty of areas that make it more attractive. But my grocery-shopping pattern is particular for a reason. I like the unknown element of going to a grocery store. I like the simplicity of jotting down a grocery list on my hand. And Hiku doesn't offer enough to compel me to change my pattern just yet.

Bottom line, if you think the Hiku will fit with your particular patterns, then it's a solid product. But it doesn't offer enough incentive to tempt people already satisfied with their grocery-shopping experiences."
FortrezZ Water Sensor review:|"

Flood sensors aren't complicated devices. What distinguishes them from each other are features -- and with more features come higher prices. The FortrezZ (pronounced ""Fortress-Z"") Water and Temperature Sensor clocks in at about $50 (available internationally, price converts to roughly £30 and AU$65), which falls directly between the slightly pricier feature-rich Fibaro Flood Sensor and the slightly cheaper basic-but-solid SmartThings and Aeon Labs sensors. The problem is, the FortrezZ runs into major performance problems, something a security device can't afford to do. Plus, the FortrezZ actually boasts fewer functional features than some of its more affordable competitors.

If you're looking for a basic flood sensor, the FortrezZ is overpriced. And if you're less concerned with price, the FortrezZ's feature set is too sparse. The only real strength of the FortrezZ Water and Temperature is its simplicity. But bottom line, it isn't reliable, so I can't recommend the FortrezZ Water Sensor to anyone.

Setting up the FortrezZ is easy enough, although it'll take a few minutes and a screwdriver. After installing the batteries and screwing the plastic body together, you can sync it with a Z-Wave gateway, like SmartThings or Piper, with the press of a button. In the five or six times I installed and reinstalled the FortrezZ Water and Temperature Sensor, I never ran into problems. The directions were clear and the network communication worked well.

After the Sensor is set up, you can put it anywhere at risk of flooding. The metal leads that detect water extend from the body of the FortrezZ itself, so you won't have to do anything more than set the detector on the ground and forget about it.

Disappointingly, though, the FortrezZ Water and Temperature Sensor's simplicity is one of its only assets.

Most flood sensors have two or three metal probes, or leads, that extend from the body. When these leads contact water, they detect increased conductivity between them, and set off an alarm of some sort. It's a simple design, and it works reliably.

The FortrezZ Water and Temperature Sensor uses this same approach, but to poor effect. The plastic supports on the body of the device are slightly longer than the probes, so when a small amount of water is trickling underneath the leads, the sensor rarely detects it. That's right: The FortrezZ only detects water when it has pooled high enough to contact the probes. This is a major design flaw. A representative from FortrezZ explained that the probes are recessed to avoid false alarms that could be caused by damp basement floors or metal surfaces like A/C drip pans. But even when I tested the sensor in a few millimeters of water, when the  water was barely contacting the probes, the alarm would only sometimes  activate.

Right now, the primary problem seems to be related to hardware (the  leads are too recessed), but it is possible their sensitivity must also be tweaked.

Not only is the water-sensing function problematic, the temperature sensing doesn't work with SmartThings or Piper, the two Z-Wave gateways I used to test the FortrezZ Sensor. Although a representative from FortrezZ assured me this problem will be patched soon in a SmartThings software update, for now the FortrezZ Water and Temperature Sensor, despite its name, will only function as a water sensor for most users (unless they have either Vera and HomeSeer home control systems).

The FortrezZ is also disappointingly meager when it comes to additional hardware  and software features. The device's design is rudimentary -- a bulky  black box with a button and two probes on the bottom. It features a  chirping alarm if it detects water, but it isn't watertight (although an  alternative, otherwise identical model exchanges one for the other,  featuring a watertight case but no audible alarm).

Compare similar devices like the ZigBee SmartThings Leak Sensor and Z-Wave Fibaro Flood Sensor: The SmartThings Sensor, for 10 bucks less, features a functional temperature sensor. The Fibaro Flood Sensor, for 10 bucks more, features all sorts of things -- from telescopic leads that avoid the issues of the FortrezZ probes, to versatile hardware capabilities.

The feature FortrezZ does execute better than many other sensors is association. Association basically is a process that sets up direct communication between two devices, bypassing the integrating hub (such as SmartThings), in order to establish a more reliable connection in the event of a disaster, like a fire, that could damage the hub. Although the ease and possibility of association is mostly predicated by the controlling hub, the FortrezZ simplifies the process considerably, especially when compared with the Fibaro.

Overall, the FortrezZ Water and Temperature Sensor only half works. It can sense water -- if water is pooling. It can sense temperature -- pending software updates from SmartThings. And its extra features are too few in number to make much difference in the overall product. I simply can't recommend a $50 device that 50 percent works.

If software updates come soon to fix the temperature-sensing problems and perhaps increase the sensitivity of the misplaced leads (though that may not help the problem), then this device could be competitive in the flood sensor market. For now, though, avoid the FortrezZ Water and Temperature Sensor."
ETwater's sprinkler concierge will set your watering schedule for you|"

ETwater promises to maintain your lawn and garden without wasting water. It's as much a service as a single device, but essentially, ETwater attaches to the existing controller for your home's irrigation system, monitors the weather and schedules watering times accordingly.

By using cellular 3G and 4G signals, ETwater promises more reliability than Wi-Fi. The service is available for businesses as well as consumers, and ETwater can also plan around local watering restrictions. The company, also called ETwater (the ET stands for Evapotranspiration), backs up its device by replacing and repairing hardware during your term and offering all customers 24/7 ""concierge-level"" service to help you use the system and schedule watering appropriately.

ETwater doesn't have a dedicated app yet, but you can use the Web interface to interact with your smart sprinkler yourself or simply let the system take the reins. It'll track how much you're saving and watch for leaks based on water flow. According to the site, you can install the controller yourself, but care specialists will help if necessary to make sure the system is working to its fullest.

A sprinkler controller that can monitor the weather and react accordingly is certainly a great idea that might save you money in the long run, but it's an idea shared by a number of other devices. At $35 per month plus a variable installation cost, this is by no means a cheap service. Perhaps the professional care offered by ETwater really can make a difference. Otherwise, I have a hard time seeing the value in what it's offering.

The $250 Rachio Iro, the $200 Blossom Smart Watering Controller and the $250 GreenIQ Smart Garden Hub are all consumer-ready products that do essentially the same thing as the ETwater service without monthly fees.

With smart home security, I understand the debate between buying a do-it-yourself product such as SmartThings and paying for a service such as ADT. The former is a one-and-done cost with essentially the same gadgets, but the latter offers professional monitoring and the ability to call 911 when you can't. With a smart sprinkler system, the benefits of a professional service aren't as clear to me.

An ETwater spokesperson said, ""At the heart of the service is a learning system that is constantly changing and getting more insights and capabilities."" ETwater takes pride in the number of data sources it uses to customize your lawn care and improve it over time, but since the other options also use local forecasts, I wonder how much of a difference all the extra info can tangibly make.

You can expect some fees whenever you use a cellular signal, but still, $35 per month seems like a lot. GreenIQ actually offers 3G as an option, and you'd pay a fee for it, but you can forgo the fee and use Wi-Fi with GreenIQ if you choose. Blossom backs up Wi-Fi with power-line, using the wires in your home to transmit the signal over longer distances, and neither will cost you. Rachio only has Wi-Fi for connectivity, but does have an IFTTT channel, letting you use it as part of your larger smart home.

With the installation costs taken into account, you'll end up paying several times more for ETwater than you would for any of the three DIY options. You'll pay a $250 initial cost for ETwater with a one-year service contract. With a two-year deal, you only pay $100 up front, and if you sign up for three years, you don't have to pay anything initially. For 12 months of service at $35 per month, the first option will end up costing you $670 for a year, the second will cost you $940 for two, and with the third you'll pay $1,260 for three years. Again, if this was your only option for a way to smarten up your sprinklers, it might be worth it to help the environment and save on your water bill. As it stands, ETwater better have one heck of a concierge service.

ETwater looks to be aimed more at businesses than consumers, but either way, the service approach to lawn care is a unique one. I'm just skeptical that it can prove more worthwhile than DIY devices given the monthly service cost. That said, I'm happy to use the CNET Smart Home to try it out this spring, and give ETwater the chance to prove me wrong."
Walmart Great Value 10W LED Light Bulb (60W Equivalent) review:|"

LED light bulbs hit a new milestone this year, with 60W replacements selling for less than $5, no rebates necessary. At that price, upgrading from incandescents is a no-brainer, especially considering that an incandescent will add about $7 to your yearly energy bill, compared to just over a buck from a comparable LED.

One of those low-cost options can be found on the shelf at Walmart. Sold under the ""Great Value"" brand name, the bulb is a dimmable 60W replacement that costs just $4.88 a piece. At that price, the dimmable bit is perhaps its strongest selling point -- comparable low-cost options like the Philips 60W Replacement LED and the GE Bright Stik LED won't dim at all. The Walmart LED is also noticeably brighter than those two, and it promises a longer lifespan of 25,000 hours.

That's enough for me to call this bulb a good purchase, but it isn't a perfect one. Yes, it dims, but it doesn't dim particularly well, and failed to go much lower than 20 percent brightness on any of the dimmers I tested it with (ideally, you want a bulb that'll hit 10 percent or lower). It also flickered a fair amount at those lowest settings, which might be another deal breaker if you like the lights down low. Walmart's LED deserves consideration alongside Philips and GE in that bargain-priced tier, but for smooth, satisfying dimming performance, I'd rather spend a few extra bucks on a bulb like the Osram 60W Replacement LED.

Walmart's Great Value line of LEDs are actually manufactured by TCP, a brand that's impressed us in the past. I was impressed again as I started testing out the dimmable 60W replacement Great Value bulb. With 874 lumens to its name, it's officially the brightest 60W replacement bulb I've tested. The 5,000 K daylight version of the bulb does even better, coming in 100 lumens brighter and putting it closer to 75W replacement territory than 60W.

You get that brightness from a power draw of 10 watts. That's the same as GE Bright Stik and the Ikea Ledare LEDs, but obviously more efficient than either of those two because you're getting more brightness for the power draw -- roughly 87 lumens per watt. The only low-cost LED that beats it in efficiency is the Philips 60W Replacement LED, which also costs $5. That bulb puts out 821 lumens from a power draw of 8.5 watts, giving you nearly 100 lumens per watt.

Designwise, the bulb is simple and inoffensive looking, sticking to the safe side of LED aesthetics. It's an omnidirectional bulb, which means that it puts light out in all directions. That makes it a good pick for most general lighting needs, and suitable for something like a bedside reading lamp, where downward cast light is especially important.

The bulb also claims a lifespan of 25,000 hours -- well over 20 years if you're using it for an average of three hours a day. That's better than you'll get with most of the LEDs you'll find priced at 5 dollars or less. The Philips 60W Replacement LED only promises 15,000 hours, for instance, while the GE Bright Stik offers even less at 11,000 hours.

Walmart backs the longevity claims with a three-year warranty for each bulb. That offers plenty of buying reassurance, given that it'll pay for itself in less than a year if you're upgrading from an incandescent. Other options do slightly better, though -- you get five years of coverage with the Cree 4Flow LED and the Philips 60W Replacement LED.

Something else worth noting: you'll want to be careful when you're making your purchase, as Walmart offers multiple versions of this bulb with confusingly similar packaging. Different color temperatures aren't color-coded using traditional orange and blue hues, and it's also easy to mistake the dimmable and non-dimmable versions. Make sure you double-check the packaging before ringing up.

As said before, the Walmart LED boasts an impressive level of brightness, and puts out more light than any other 60W replacement bulb we've tested. That's especially true with the daylight version of the bulb, which puts out 974 lumens -- closer to the 1,100 lumen benchmark for 75W bulbs than the 800-lumen benchmark for 60W ones. If brightness is what matters most to you, then it's an obvious pick.

I was also happy with how each version of the bulb handles heat. LED light bulbs will see a gradual, imperceptible dip in brightness over the first 90 minutes or so of use. This is because of the heat that they produce -- just like with your phone or your laptop, performance decreases as heat increases.

LEDs typically use heat sinks, convection vents, or special designs to help compensate for heat buildup, and as whatever method the bulb uses kicks in to counteract the heat, the light bulb will hit what's called a ""steady state,"" the level at which the brightness stops dipping. This steady state is where bulbs are rated for brightness, and where we measure them as well, so you don't have to worry about getting shortchanged on lumens due to heat buildup.

A bulb that manages heat well will hit that steady state in quick fashion, and it also won't lose too much of its initial brightness. I look for bulbs that hit their steady state in less than an hour, and ones that lose less than 10 percent of the initial brightness recorded when we first turn them on.

In the Walmart LED's case, both the soft white and daylight versions of the bulb leveled out after about 50 minutes, and in that time, both lost about 12 percent of their initial brightness. That's a solid B+ in my book, and good enough to say that you could probably get away with using these bulbs in an enclosed fixture that traps in heat without worrying about too significant a decline in brightness or longevity.

I was less impressed, however, with the bulb's dimming performance. Neither version of the bulb that I tested was able to dim much lower than 20 percent on any of the dimmer switches I tested them on, which is not a good result. Ideally, a dimmable bulb should be able to get down below 10 percent, and preferably below 5.

Another problem: both of the bulbs flickered at those low settings. It was most noticeable with an older, rotary-style dimmer designed for incandescents, but it happened on a newer, LED-compatible Leviton slide dimmer, too. In fairness, it was barely noticeable on two of the other slide dimmers I tested, so your mileage definitely may vary depending on what hardware you've got hardwired into your home. For my money, though, I'd rather go out with a dimmable bulb that didn't flicker on any of our test switches -- the $10 Osram 60W Replacement LED comes to mind as a good example.

It's hard to find much fault with a functional 60W replacement LED that costs less than $5, especially one that offers as much brightness as the Walmart Great Value LED. That puts it right up there with the Philips 60W Replacement LED and the GE Bright Stik LED as a top LED value pick in the $5-or-less price tier.

The Walmart LED is dimmable whereas those other two are not, but I'm not sure that it's worth using with a dimmer switch at all, given that it doesn't dim very low and flickers at the lowest settings. For basic lighting needs, it's a great pick, but if you like the lights down low, I'd recommend spending a couple of extra bucks on a bulb that performs a little better."
The owl-shaped Ulo camera watches over your roost|"

Most security cameras try to keep a low profile, discreetly blending in with their surroundings. But Ulo, by designer Vivien Muller, is a bit different.

For starters, it's shaped like an owl with a two-way mirror that looks like a beak and masks Ulo's night-vision-equipped camera and built-in motion sensor. You'll also notice two large LCD screens/owl eyes where Ulo communicates its status at a glance. If Ulo looks sleepy, you need to charge its batteries; it blinks when someone takes a picture from the app; its eyes follow movement in the house and if someone is watching the live video stream, Ulo will squint.

Beyond that, Ulo has pretty standard specs. You can live stream video from your Android or iOS device (or from the Web interface) in either day or night vision mode and it has an alert setting that's supposed to send out a GIF whenever it detects movement and you're away.

Ulo also has a rechargeable battery that's designed to last up to a week (or you can just leave it plugged in 24-7) and, like Netgear's Arlo cameras, Ulo is rated for indoor and outdoor use (ranging from 14 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, or -10 degrees Celsius to 50 degrees Celsius). And, it plans to get its own IFTTT channel so you can pair your Ulo cam with devices from other manufacturers.

Aside from the cute, gimmicky design, Ulo actually offers a lot. Only a couple of cameras I've reviewed work inside and outside and even fewer boast both weatherproofing and battery power.

Ulo has already raised over $900,000, far surpassing its original $223,119 goal. Units are expected to ship to backers beginning in November of 2016 and you have 8 days left to snag one of your own for €149 (that's roughly US$158/£105/AU$218 at the current exchange rate)."
TrackR Atlas maps your home to help you find your stuff|"

In 2014, a Santa Barbara-based startup called TrackR crowdfunded almost $1.7 million dollars to manufacture TrackR Bravo, a $29 Bluetooth beacon designed to help you track your stuff. The idea was simple -- clip it to your keychain or slip it in your wallet, then pair it with your Android or iOS device to track its location or make it ring next time you misplace something.

Now, just months after the last of the Bravo tags finally shipped out to backers, TrackR's team is back on Indiegogo. This time, they're seeking funds for TrackR Atlas, a $39 Wi-Fi plug designed to make those Bravo tags even smarter.

The promise of Atlas is room-specific location tracking for all of your Bravo tags. Plug Atlas in and it'll ""map out"" the room -- plug enough of them in, and TrackR will be able to tell you which room your missing item is located in. From there, you'll be able to ring your Bravo tag like normal to help find it.

The Wi-Fi connectivity is the real upgrade here, though. The Bravo tags use Bluetooth radios, which means that you can't track them when you aren't in Bluetooth range. With both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, the Atlas plugs fix that shortcoming. They'll stay connected to the tags in your home 24/7, and allow you to monitor them from afar. That seems especially handy for pets -- clip a TrackR Bravo onto your dog's collar, and you'll get an alert on your phone if she ever jumps the fence while you're away from home.

TrackR's also promising compatibility with the voice-controlled Amazon Echo smart speaker -- that means you'll be able to ask Alexa where your stuff's at.

The other big selling point is TrackR's crowd GPS network. If you lose your wallet while you're out running errands and another TrackR user passes within Bluetooth range of its location, the network will update with the new info.

These are some pretty cool claims, but they bring up a lot of questions. How accurate is that room specific item-tracking? If you're tracking your pet, but you don't have enough Atlas plugs to cover your entire home, will you get flooded with annoying notifications every time Rex comes in and out of your system's Bluetooth range? We haven't had the chance to test those TrackR Bravo tags out yet, so it's hard to say how useful they are compared to similar products, like Tile.

TrackR Atlas will ship worldwide, with plugs available for sockets in the US, UK, European Union and Australia. That $39 price point for each plug converts to about £25, or about AU$55, though you'll need to add $10 (roughly £7, AU$14) for shipping outside of the US. We'll try and test the system out in the CNET Smart Home as soon as we can -- once we do, we'll let you know how well it works with a full review."
Samsung Smartcam HD Plus review:|"

Samsung is taking on Nest yet again with another Wi-Fi security camera. 	The Korean giant unveiled the new  	SmartCam HD Plus in November, available now in the US at Costco stores and online at Costco.com (the MSRP is $190, but it's currently available at Costco for just $110; there's no current plan to expand internationally). The live-streaming camera offers full 1080p HD resolution with a 130-degree field of view, motion and sound alerts and local storage (with a 16GB microSD card included).

Although this new model is supposed to offer ""improved night vision"" as well as ""advanced motion and audio detection"" designed to keep false alarms at bay, I noticed no discernible difference between the HD Plus and the $190  	Samsung SmartCam HD Pro I reviewed back in 2014 (I used the three HD Pros currently installed at the CNET Smart Home for reference). And, while the next-gen HD Plus is smaller and generally more discreet than the HD Pro, it still feels cheaply made. It also doesn't work with SmartThings yet -- a smart-home company that Samsung acquired in August of 2014.

Samsung's $190 SmartCam HD Plus is a decent live-streaming security camera that's worth considering if you're interested in local storage, particularly if you take advantage of  	the Costco sale. Just don't expect it to be a massive improvement over the last-gen HD Pro.

The HD Pro, which will continue to be sold alongside the new HD Plus, is big and clumsy-looking and made of white plastic -- not exactly what you're going for when you're talking about discreet home security. 	The HD Plus, on the other hand, is smaller and comes in a black finish. You can even detach the camera from its base to make it less conspicuous.

While these design updates make a lot of sense, they also bear a striking resemblance to the $200   	Nest Cam, one of Samsung's direct competitors in the DIY home security camera space. (Nest aqcuired startup Dropcam and replaced its already-impressive  Dropcam Pro  with the 1080p, live-streaming  Nest Cam).

But Nest Cam boasts a magnetic base that you can easily snap to a magnetic surface (similar to the   	Netgear Arlo  and the  Ezviz Mini) and a streamlined mobile app that works with Nest's  smart thermostat  and its  smoke and carbon monoxide detector  -- two things that the latest SmartCam models are missing. (The HD Plus operates on the same SmartCam Android and iOS apps as the HD Pro, and they aren't particularly easy to navigate.)

Set up is relatively straightforward -- you have to plug in the camera (which is a challenge of its own because of the location of the power port), download the app, connect to your local Wi-Fi network, and wait for the status LED on the camera to turn from blue to green.

But once you're in the app, the layout is pretty chaotic. It has a lot of features, including live streaming, a timestamped motion and audio activity log, access to saved clips and adjustable settings like the sensitivity of the speaker, the microphone, the motion detector and the audio detector. It also has the ability to opt in and out of push and email notifications related to motion and audio activity.

There are even more options on the live streaming page. You can record a 30-second clip on demand -- either to the app or to the microSD card; you can take a picture; you can enabled two-way talk to communicate with whoever's near the camera from your phone or tablet; and you can tweak the resolution -- low, medium and high resolution options are available.

In addition, you can play sounds of a police siren, a generic alarm or a dog barking (the HD Pro only offered ""lullaby"" music clips, so the additional sounds are more security-centric). You can also adjust the brightness of the screen, rotate the picture and record your own audio clips.

That's a whole lot of functionality packed into this camera and its app, but it isn't executed particularly well. And it can get even more confusing if you add more than one camera (we have three SmartCam HD Pro's and one SmartCam HD Plus set up under a single log-in).

Beyond the challenge of locating various features inside the app, it isn't always clear what certain options mean. For example, the fourth icon at the bottom of the screenshot to the right (which reminds me of the chalk outline guy you see in detective movies) is for setting motion zones. I guess it's fairly intuitive, but it would be easier if there were some sort of accompanying description.

Here's an overview of the basic specs and features available on the SmartCam HD Plus, the SmartCam HD Pro and Nest Cam:

Overall, the SmartCam HD Plus performed pretty well. The live stream was responsive, and I had few issues with lag time or pixelation. The video resolution adjusts automatically depending on the Wi-Fi connection, but you can also disable this feature in the ""Setup"" section and switch between low, medium and high resolutions manually instead. According to the specs on Samsung's site, low is standard-def 640x360, medium is 1,280x720 (720p HD), and high is 1,920x1,080 (1080p HD).

I tested out the live stream in various rooms under different types of lighting in low, medium and high resolution settings. While I was able to detect small details with the ""high"" 1080p HD video, it wasn't as crisp as Nest Cam. (See the screenshots below for reference.)

Fortunately, I did receive prompt motion and sound alerts, and I had no trouble viewing the related saved clips either from the ""playback"" feature in the app or by ejecting the microSD card and enlisting a card reader. The default alert settings were much too sensitive, however, resulting in near-constant motion and audio alerts. The good news is that you can adjust the sensitivity and that helps somewhat. I did receive a few phantom alerts in night vision mode regardless of any sensitivity adjustments, though.

The two-way talk function works pretty well, but you do have to hold down the microphone button the whole time you want to talk. Still, it's easy enough to use, and the audio quality is decent. It was also simple to hear audio from saved video clips.

One thing the SmartCam HD Plus is missing right now is third-party integrations -- that's another area where Nest Cam excels in comparison. Nest boasts a lot of smart home integrations; it works with a variety of non-Nest products through   	Works with Nest, a program that pairs Nest products with smart-home devices from other manufacturers. The brand also announced plans to inject Nest Weave tech --  a protocol language first announced by Nest's  Alphabet/Google parent company at Google I/O 2015 in May -- into  a Yale deadbolt, which is expected to feature prominently in the Nest app alongside Nest's own products when it debuts in 2016.

Samsung, of course, has been going toe to toe with Google's Nest and Apple in the nascent smart home space, having  	 acquired SmartThings just two months after Nest bought Dropcam (and six months after  Google bought Nest). SmartThings recently released its  second-generation Z-Wave and ZigBee hub, a product  we installed at the CNET Smart Home to control various connected devices from the company's universal app. It also has its own IFTTT channel.

The existing SmartCam HD Pro works on the SmartThings platform, but compatibility between the new HD Plus and SmartThings is still in the works.

The $190 Samsung SmartCam HD Plus (available for just $110 at Costco right now) is a fine camera if you're looking for live-streaming capabilities, customizable settings and local microSD card storage that's accessible straight from the app. The problem is that it costs the same as its SmartCam HD Pro predecessor and offers very little in terms of new features, app design and performance.  Sure, the camera itself looks different, but it still doesn't feel as durable as  	Nest Cam, Netgear's Arlo and other security cameras I've reviewed.

Get the HD Plus if you like local storage, want motion  	and sound alerts, and would rather access saved clips straight from the app. But, if sound alerts aren't that important to you, you could just get the Ezviz Mini, a $70 DIY live-streaming camera that also comes with a 16GB microSD card. But, if you're looking for solid 1080p HD live streaming and don't mind cloud storage -- or a $10 monthly fee for saved clips -- the $200 Nest Cam really is your best bet for quality high definition live streaming and video playback."
The smart Ario Lamp will keep your brain on schedule and make your day|"

According to Ario, a new company that's making waves on Kickstarter, our daily light exposure has serious implications for ""sleep, mood, immune system, weight management, and overall well-being."" Basically, certain light temperatures trigger our brains to release certain hormones -- a cool biological trick that helps us wake up or prepare for sleep. But the artificial lights that so many of us work under every day can pose a serious problem by sending misinformation to our brains' sensors.

Ario's solution? A lamp. The Ario Lamp is different from other lamps, though, in that it learns your daily schedule using algorithms much like the Nest Learning Thermostat's. It uses this information to light your home in a way that keeps your brain working to the right time. This should theoretically improve your sleeping patterns as well as providing other health benefits.

Ario will also use geo-location to light your rooms according to your local environment. It won't simply mimic the light outdoors, but will supplement it. So overcast days could cause warmer light inside, which will help avoid the effects of the darker months in cold regions.

Other devices, like the Sunn Light, have done things similar to Ario in the past. Ario's just trying to sharpen the idea that's already out there and make it affordable for broader audiences. The first distinction I like is its software. It will learn your particular schedule over time, so you can let it fade into the background of daily life. And although Ario won't offer colors like purple or green, as some other smart lights do, that doesn't mean it's skimping on hardware.

The Ario Lamp will have about three times the brightness of a 60-watt bulb, emitting up to 2,400 Lumens, all for $400 (roughly converted, that comes to about £260 or AU$565). With many smart light bulbs clocking in well above $50, the Ario Lamp's output is impressive, but the price is a bit steep. For early contributors on Kickstarter, though, Ario is offering pre-order prices at $200.

The biggest explanation for the Lamp's price is its integration capabilities. It will connect to your home's Wi-Fi, meaning it's got potential to work with other connected devices. CEO Brian Hoskins expects the device to work with open-API developers, like Philips Hue, Nest and maybe even wearable tech (though he didn't give any specifics there). We'll only be able to accurately gauge how well the Ario Lamp integrates with other devices when we get our hands on one, but I'm excited at the prospect of it working with other smart bulbs to act as sort of central nervous system for home lighting.

As with any crowdsourced product, doubts about production and distribution won't be allayed until it's due to be shipped to customers. But Ario's design is respectable, if only for its ambition. Instead of using replaceable bulbs, for example, the light will come from one large disc. Its outer ring will be brushed aluminum, which Ario says will diffuse light without diminishing it. And on the top and bottom of the ring, two glass domes will allow light to shine through, upward or downward. In the center of all that will be a circuit board with over 70 individual LEDs.

Ario claims the lifespan of the lamp should be at least 20 years, but I would still be a little nervous dishing out over 100 bucks for a lamp with no replaceable bulbs. Of course, Ario might just prove me wrong."
iSmartAlarm Spot review:|"

iSmartAlarm's $99 Spot is a cute little indoor security camera with a magnetic base. It's power-adapter-dependent and offers 720p HD video resolution, free 30-clip rolling cloud storage and a built-in microSD card slot (it can accommodate up to a 64GB microSD card, but that isn't included), as well as night vision and motion and sound alerts. Spot is definitely worth considering, especially if you're looking for a lower-priced DIY camera that's big on features.

Spot is actually the third camera to come from the iSmartAlarm brand. Its first model, the original iCamera, is still sold as a $150 optional add-on to the sensors that accompany the standard security kit, but it was glitchy during our testing.

The second-gen $150 iCamera Keep was generally more reliable than its predecessor, making it a much better option if you want to add a camera to your iSmartAlarm system.

At the same time, the Keep camera didn't wow us due to its lack of local or cloud storage. That put it at a serious disadvantage as a standalone security camera when models like the $150 ArcSoft Simplicam, the $190 Samsung SmartCam HD Plus and the $200 Nest Cam all offer either local or cloud storage -- or both. And some brands, like Netgear's $220 Arlo Q , as well as its $180 Arlo, the $70 Ezviz Mini, and the $279 Icontrol Piper NV have free cloud storage services.

Now, the iCamera Keep has been updated and it can store up to 30 clips for free, but Spot brings iSmartAlarm even closer to the DIY security camera mainstream with its suite of new features and ease-of-setup-and-install.

Spot performed well overall, too, delivering prompt motion and sound alerts that I could view on the related app. One drawback is that the app doesn't clearly differentiate between motion and sound alerts when you're scrolling through the saved video clips.

But, the night vision was pretty crisp and its advanced ""sound recognition,"" designed to detect a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm and issue a custom alert worked very well. (iSmartAlarm plans to add more sounds in the future, like glass breaking or a baby crying.)

iSmartAlarm's $99 Spot security camera has more to offer than the $70 Ezviz Mini, but still manages to cost about $100 less than many of today's high-def models. Definitely consider Spot if you're looking for a smart and simple DIY security camera."
Juvo Labs' promising technology goes live on Indiegogo|"

Sleep is one of life's enigmas. We do it everyday, we know how bad it feels when we miss it, but we don't fully understand it. I asked three friends at the office about how they sleep, and heard three different answers. Part of the problem: everyone's sleep habits differ, so optimizing sleep patterns will never be as simple as counting out hour-and-a-half REM cycles.

Various sleep monitors have gone to market in the past few years hoping to solve this problem, but almost all of them (from Jawbone to Fitbit to Philips Actiwatch) use technology that monitors movement to gauge sleep. While that approach can provide semi-accurate data, it only monitors sleep. In other words, it can't directly help you sleep better.

Today a small company called Juvo Labs is opening a project on Indiegogo that might change sleep technology by turning your whole room into a sleep assistant. Here's how it works: you slip a fiber-optic pad under your mattress (Juvo will work with spring, foam, memory foam, and even some air mattresses, according to the company). Then you connect the pad to a square monitor that rests on your bedside table. Using technology that tracks bodily vibrations, the pad will monitor both your heart rate and breathing patterns to tell whether you're awake or asleep, and what stage of sleep you're in.

Juvo distinguishes itself from other sleep monitors in two big ways, though. First, Juvo will integrate with various smart-home tech like light bulbs (Philips Hue and Lifx), thermostats (Nest), outlets (Belkin WeMo) and even other consumer health products (Fitbit, Jawbone and others). Second, the monitor will offer advice based on your personal sleep patterns.

I like both of these additions to sleep technology. The integration has high potential: if Juvo can sense when I fall asleep and tell my lights and TV to switch off and my Nest to set my sleep temperature, that's one thing. But Juvo will integrate with IFTTT, which opens a whole new realm of possibility. That means I could set up biological triggers in my apartment, like my door locking and my lights all shutting off when I fall asleep, or my lights brightening slowly as I'm beginning to wake up. Plus, Juvo can wake me up a little earlier or later to let me finish a REM cycle, so I don't wake up from deep sleep (a major contributor to morning grogginess).

Advice from Juvo could remove a lot of the anxiety people feel regarding sleep. It's no coincidence that so many online articles are constantly sharing the newest ""secret to sleep."" Especially as people age, sleep becomes both more difficult and more important to keep consistent. Juvo will use your sleep data to personalize its advice to you, whether that means suggesting a nap if you've been missing REM sleep, advising changes to your exercise schedule if it's disrupting your pattern, or even recommending a visit to the doctor if your heartbeat or breathing patterns indicate potential health problems.

It's important to remember that crowdsourcing projects sometimes go south even when they achieve impressive funding goals. While the technology behind the pad is sound, I'm curious to see how well it works, especially in larger beds where partners sleep. And some of the integration could present serious problems. I don't want to wake up to midnight lights or blasts from my TV if the pad or monitor malfunction. The app is also currently under development, so almost no information about it is available, aside from its planned compatibility with both Android and iOS.

Besides these concerns -- which are typical of any technology before its release -- the creative solutions and technical savvy of Juvo Labs has me excited. Juvo is planned to be available globally for $200 (converted, that's about £130 and AU$280), but early contributors to the Indiegogo page will get it for about two-thirds of full price."
Nyrius Smart Outlet review:|"

Smart plugs and outlets, as I've mentioned before, are the foundation of a smart home. They retrofit everyday electronics like lamps to transform a household from a fragmented group of things into a unified space. But different products work for different people. Just as a city dweller whose daily destinations are within blocks of his or her apartment might not need a very good geofencing lock, a person looking only for remote-control electronics might not need a more versatile but expensive smart plug.

Certain plugs, though, I have a hard time recommending to anyone. The Nyrius Smart Outlet is one of those. It can't integrate with other products -- even other Nyrius products. The Bluetooth connectivity is spotty, and some of the features work only sporadically. Its design is clunky, and the price is too high. At $40, the Nyrius is only 10 bucks cheaper than the far superior Belkin WeMo Insight Switch and $20 cheaper than the high-potential iDevices Switch. For most people, I'd say skip this offering.

If you've paired Bluetooth tech with your phone before, setting up the Nyrius Smart Outlet will be a breeze. Most other smart plugs, like the Belkin WeMo Switch, use Wi-Fi or perhaps Z-Wave to connect with user devices. Bluetooth is easier to set up, because you don't have to sync the Outlet with your home network -- just your phone. Basically, plug in your Outlet and activate your Bluetooth, and you'll be able to access all of the Nyrius Smart Outlet features almost immediately.

Once I set up my Nyrius Smart Outlet, it only took a couple of minutes to familiarize myself with the corresponding app, Nyrius Outlet. The app's interface is spare and the three primary functions of the plug are immediately apparent. While this simplicity is welcome, I was surprised by the app's exclusivity. Unlike applications created for flexibility and integration, like WeMo's or SmartThings', the Nyrius Outlet app deals only with Nyrius Outlets. That means even other Nyrius products require a separate app.

Part of the appeal of smart technology is ease of use. In theory, it should be more efficient to tap your phone a few times than to manually control all your electronics. But if you have to pull up separate apps for each product, you lose that efficiency. And even if you were to outfit your home exclusively with Nyrius Smart Outlets, you still would have to activate each one individually, since the app offers no group commands.

Overall, despite a relatively simple interface and setup, the Nyrius Smart Outlet suffers from the app's exclusivity and inefficiency.

The design of every smart plug or switch aims for a different effect. The Belkin WeMo Insight Switch features a functional aesthetic that aims for unobtrusive. The iDevices Switch uses a sleek, white plastic face and colorful LED strip to distract from its blocky form. The Nyrius Smart Outlet somehow combines the worst elements from its competitors.

Put bluntly, the Nyrius Smart Outlet is ugly. If plugged into the top of a standard wall outlet, its bulky matte-white body covers both inputs completely. The oblong shape is also distracting, and the light on it is barely visible. From a distance, the tiny rectangle could be mistaken for a spot of dirt on the plastic background.

Whereas the lights on the iDevices Switches communicate particular messages, and are generally free for personalized coloring, the Nyrius light is nondescript and simply indicates that the Outlet is plugged in.

Not only is the design poor, but the features are weak, too. The Nyrius Smart Outlet enables you to turn your lights on and off through your phone, and you can set up schedules for those commands. But beyond those basic functions, you can't do much. No light dimmer; no energy tracker.

The Proximity feature is a cool idea: when you enter Bluetooth range, your Smart Outlet will automatically turn on. When you leave, your Smart Outlet will switch off. GPS-dependent geofencing can be finicky, so Nyrius has hit on a creative close-proximity geofencing solution. But the Proximity function runs into problems at every turn.

First of all, the app must always run in the background to use the Proximity function. Even when I kept the app on, the switch rarely registered my phone leaving the Bluetooth range, and it sent me a push notification requesting access to the switch half the time when I re-entered range. The most annoying part of the Proximity function stemmed from the limited Bluetooth range. Bluetooth is a close-proximity protocol, which meant walking around inside the CNET Smart Home, I was constantly entering and exiting Bluetooth range. That's right: the lights in the living room were constantly switching on and off, and my phone was constantly buzzing with push notifications.

If the Proximity feature worked well, I'd be happier about the Nyrius Smart Outlet. But for now, its limited features are not worth $40.

At a glance, the Nyrius Smart Outlet might seem like a better deal than its competitors. But with its poor design, limited features and hit-or-miss performance, it can't earn its own $40 price tag.

Although the Bluetooth approach to a smart outlet might seem to avoid the complications of involved smart-home integration setups, it perpetrates the problems those complicated setups are made to avoid. Because of the performance issues, I can't recommend the Nyrius Smart Outlet to anyone, except maybe apartment dwellers on a tight budget. But with Black Friday approaching, why not wait, get some cheaper remote control options and skip this Smart Outlet altogether?"
BeOn Starter Pack review:|"

BeOn's pitch: a smarter smart bulb. Each one features a yellow module that pops right into the center of the bulb; that module includes a battery backup that'll let the lights shine without power, a microphone that listens for your doorbell or burglar alarm, and a Bluetooth radio that lets you sync things up with your smartphone. BeOn's bulbs learn your usage patterns, too. Tell the system you're away for the evening, and the bulbs will automatically ""replay"" your typical lighting changes to make it look like you're home -- no programming needed.

It's an intriguing pitch -- both for the focus on security and for the built-in batteries, which keep your automations working even when things are switched off (or when the power's out). That frees you up to use your lights like you normally would, and it gives these bulbs a strong selling point over more traditional smart bulbs that require you to leave your switches on.

The problem is that, unlike a lot of those more traditional alternatives, BeOn's bulbs are really expensive -- $75 each, or $200 for a three-bulb starter kit (that comes out to roughly £50/AU$105 per bulb, or about £130/AU$285 for the kit. BeOn Bulbs aren't available outside of the US yet, but the company hopes to expand internationally in 2016). Your automation options are also surprisingly limited -- you can integrate them with your doorbell or your alarm system, but you can't program a timed schedule of your own, or integrate them with a larger smart home platform. I like these bulbs a lot, but unless that battery-powered, module-centric approach is what's most important to you, I'm not sure that they're worth the high cost of buying in.

Almost all of their features are geared in some way toward better peace of mind at home. You can turn them on remotely if you're coming home to a dark house. You can tell them to automatically simulate occupancy while you're away on vacation, or whenever the doorbell rings. You can use them for temporary emergency lighting if the power ever goes out.

That's an appealing level of functionality that surpasses what you'll get from most of the competition, almost all of which focuses solely on simple scheduling and remote on/off control. Interestingly, though, BeOn falls a little short with those more basic levels of smart control. You can't schedule them to turn on or off at specific times, and -- as of now -- there isn't any way to pair them up with things like motion detectors or contact sensors that track when doors get opened and closed.

There also isn't anything by way of third-party compatibility at this point. BeOn offers no official integrations with larger smart home systems or platforms -- no  IFTTT  channel, no  SmartThings  compatibility, no  Nest  support. That might change down the line, as BeOn has suggested that new integrations might come into play by way of updated battery modules. Swapping the original, yellow battery out for an updated green version that includes an Apple-approved chipset could bring  HomeKit  compatibility into play, for instance.

All of that is still yet to be determined, and nothing is promised as of right now. For now, these bulbs are standalone products that you'll use separately from any other smart home gear you might own. If you're aiming for a big, comprehensive connected home setup where everything works with everything, that might give you some justifiable pause prior to making a purchase.

After spending some time playing with a couple of BeOn bulbs in the CNET Smart Home, I've come away impressed. As smart bulbs go, they're exceptionally easy to use -- just insert the battery packs, screw them in, open the app and pair over Bluetooth. From there, all of the features are just a tap or two away.

For basic bulb control, you'll swipe up from the app's home screen to reveal each of your lights. Tap one, and you'll see a button for turning the light on and off, along with a slider for dimming them up and down. You'll also see the bulb's battery level. Most of the time, this will read as ""GOOD"" -- the batteries charge automatically whenever the light's turned on.

Thanks to those batteries, you'll be able to turn each bulb on in the app even when the lights are switched off, or when the power goes out. BeOn claims the batteries will allow the lights to shine for up to four hours on a single charge, though this depends on the brightness setting. I tested them out at full brightness, and they only lasted for about two hours. You'll need to dim down a bit if you're trying to ration your battery power for any longer than that.

Speaking of brightness, the 10-watt BeOn bulbs are certifiable 60-watt replacements, ringing in at around 775 lumens when I tested them out in our lighting lab's integrating sphere. That's within the margin of error of 800 lumens, the approximate brightness of a 60-watt incandescent bulb. In battery mode, the lights dim down a bit to help conserve power, putting out closer to 500 lumens at max brightness -- just slightly brighter than what you'd expect from an average 40-watt bulb.

That battery comes in handy with some of BeOn's automated lighting features. If you're coming home to a dark house, you can press a button in the app to turn your bulbs on for three minutes, lighting your entry even if the lamps are switched off. You can also ""train"" each bulb to turn on automatically when it hears the sound of your doorbell or burglar alarm. It's a cool, easy-to-use feature. Training worked like a charm each time I tested it, and once the bulbs know what to listen for, you can program them to come on in staggered intervals to help create the impression that someone's home.

BeOn pitches this as a security feature, citing burglaries where intruders ring the doorbell before entering to make sure the place is really empty. I see the appeal, but I wonder if it might also confuse the guests you actually want to come by. I can just imagine a friend or family member swinging by while I'm away, ringing the doorbell, then coming away with the impression that I'm shunning them. An option to activate the feature during evening hours only might be a nice addition.

The other key safety-minded feature is ""Security Lighting"" mode. You'll turn it on with a single slider; once you do, the bulbs will automatically begin ""replaying"" your typical usage from a previous day to help create the impression that you're home. BeOn says that its learning algorithm identifies periods of active lighting usage, so you can rest assured that it'll look convincing. When I tested it out after a few days of use, it did a fine job.

That level of automated simplicity has a lot of appeal. You can simulate occupancy with most other smart bulbs by creating an automated schedule, but that's a lot more tedious than simply tapping a slider and letting the bulbs figure it out on their own. Still, I could see some people preferring a more hands-on approach in favor of trusting the bulbs to get it right. And again, the lack of any scheduling capabilities whatsoever is a surprising omission.

BeOn's bulbs stand to improve as time goes on, and a lot of that has to do with the modular design. After all, it's a lot easier for BeOn to introduce new features by way of new battery packs than it is for BeOn to design entirely new bulbs.

Sure enough, BeOn's website highlights the upgradeable nature of the modules, calling it a future-proof design and all but promising that new, optional features are on the way. There's plenty of potential. A module with Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth would allow you to access the bulbs from beyond the home. A module with a built-in speaker could serve as an intercom or music streamer. A module with a temperature or humidity sensor could help you track conditions in the home.

Of course, all of that is theoretical at this point. BeOn's team hasn't committed to any specific plans for upcoming modules, nor have they committed to a timetable for when they might make their arrival. Also uncertain: the pricing. I know that I'd rather hear some more specifics on all of those fronts before plunking down my cash.

In the end, BeOn's strong slate of unique features and reliable performance give the bulbs an edge over the competition.

You don't need to worry about scheduling them. You don't need to integrate them with a hub or a larger network. You don't need to change the way you use your switches in order for them to work properly.

Still, these are Bluetooth bulbs we're talking about, and the fact that you can't integrate them into a bigger system means that you won't be able to control them from beyond the limited range of their radios. And though it might simplify things for some, leaving out scheduling capabilities was probably a misstep, especially given that these bulbs cost $75 each, or $200 for the three-bulb starter kit. If you like the specific approach to smart lighting that BeOn's offering here, I think the bulbs might be worth the price. But I'd prefer to wait and see if additional battery modules bring something new to the table -- and if the price comes down at all."
Matrix is a super hub built for total smart-home control|"

Trying to get a bunch of different smart home devices to work together seamlessly can be a serious headache. The problem is that there are a ton of devices from a bunch of different companies and these devices don't always like to work together nicely. So unless you've shrewdly pre-selected gadgets guaranteed to play nice with either Apple, Google, or Amazon, you're going to run into some issues. AdMobilize's $349 Matrix is designed to solve this problem (directly converts to about £230, AU$495).

The company describes the Matrix as a small but impressive device with the intelligence to corral, unite and command every connected gizmo living under your smart roof. This includes everything from sophisticated Nest thermostats to basic Wi-Fi webcams and even simple wireless door and window sensors.

The Matrix is a compact black disc about 4 inches in diameter (10cm), and is essentially made to serve as the ultimate hub for your fancy smart-home products. To this end AdMobilize claims the Matrix will conceal a lot of technology. Similar to a smartphone, this list of internal devices will include a camera, microphone and speakers, and sensors to measure temperature, ambient light and humidity -- not to mention a gyroscope, altimeter and barometer.

Additionally the Matrix Machine will have many methods for wireless communication at its disposal. According to AdMobilize tucked inside the Matrix chassis will be multiple radios enabling data transmission via Bluetooth, 802.11 a/b/g/n Wi-Fi, along with CDMA and GSM 3G cellular protocols. Running the show is a 1GHz quad-core application processor from silicon vendor Freescale.

The reason for all the Matrix's hardware is simple. Its creators envision it to go way beyond typical smart home hubs, which are more like specialized network routers, and operate as a high-octane smart home server -- a hub to end all hubs if you will. Indeed AdMobilize claims that by taking advantage of existing software API tools from prominent smart home device makers, for example Nest and August, the Matrix will be very automated, run its own operating system, and serve as the primary control point for these products plus any hub devices they require.

And because the gadget comes with a wide range of communication methods, AdMobilize also says that connecting semi-smart devices such as networked cameras and Bluetooth security sensors to the Matrix should be breeze.

Another interesting ability AdMobilize has in mind for the Matrix is robust presence monitoring. With cameras hooked up, the Matrix will supposedly be able to process live video feeds to accurately track the movement of particular individuals and even vehicles within sight.

This may sound a bit farfetched but the company already hawks a product, called the AdBeacon, with similar capabilities. Running complex face-detection software, the AdBeacon sits next to billboards and other physical advertisements. AdMobilize claims this enables the box-shaped camera to quantify public impressions in the real world and in real time complete with reaction analysis (positive or negative).

The final piece of the Matrix puzzle is its operating system. Intended to be completely open source, AdMobilize expressed the wish to create its own app store the desire for the Matrix. It also envisions a scenario where developers freely write applications for the product in new and innovative ways.

AdMobilize certainly has lofty ambitions for the Matrix but while I admit the device's promised abilities sound intriguing, I have serious doubts the company can actually pull off what it intends. The first obstacle is the product's high price, which even at the special Kickstarter early-bird backer fee of $199 is double that of the competing  SmartThings hub .

And while the Amazon Echo costs just slightly less at $180 (roughly converts to £125 in the UK, a little over AU$230 in Australia), the Matrix will have to bring incredibly good voice control and a beautiful user interface to the table to sway shoppers away from Amazon's slickly crafted smart home device. This is even more crucial when you consider the actual $349 price of the Matrix which is shockingly high.

I'm afraid the real challenge for the Matrix to become a real and successful product lie outside of its creator's control. Even if the final Matrix unit demonstrates rock solid and elegant command over popular gadgets such as the Nest Thermostat, support could end abruptly if the powers that be decide the AdMobilize partnership isn't worthwhile. The same is true of plans for a Matrix app store. App developers are a fickle bunch and it's always a gamble to get behind any given solution, just ask  Microsoft  and  BlackBerry ."
Xandem Technology will offer home security and integration|"

Five years ago around Halloween, Xandem Technology posted a video on YouTube of a garage-turned-graveyard. At the back of the graveyard, a skeleton -- lovingly named Chancellor Darkskull -- stood in a cage and spoke to trick-or-treaters. And when kids walked around the space, Darkskull's red-eyed gaze would follow them.

The technology behind this setup was simple, but surprisingly clever. The hub that controlled the skeleton used nodes, spaced evenly along the graveyard fence, to sense where kids were walking. But the nodes weren't traditional motion sensors; instead, they were radio transmitters that cast a net of signals across the graveyard. By tracking which communication lines were blocked or altered by a person, the network could tell the skeleton which direction to look.

Five years have passed since the video was posted, and today Xandem Technology is hoping to enter the smart home market. The developers -- an assortment of university and government-bred engineers -- have spent the time working off grants from federal agencies and academic institutions to turn the technology behind Chancellor Darkskull into a security system for businesses and an integration system for smart homes. The latter, dubbed Xandem Home, is now live on Indiegogo, and customers who preorder the system for $499 are supposed to receive beta versions within four to six months. It ships worldwide; that price converts to about £330 or AU$710. Bear in mind that not all crowdfunding projects pay off or as expected.

Using the Xandem Home system will basically look like this: you take the 10 included nodes and plug them into wall outlets around your house. Then, using the app, you sketch a rough diagram of the home layout and indicate where you plugged in the nodes. Finally, you sit back and watch your system track people's movement throughout your home.

On its face, motion tracking doesn't seem too impressive, but a few aspects elevate the potential of Xandem's technology. First, where cameras can be expensive, invasive and, along with traditional motion sensors, limited by field of vision (see our  roundup of connected security cameras), Xandem Home will feature diagrammatic imaging of movement in the home -- even if the motion is on the other side of furniture or a wall.

Xandem Home will also integrate with other proprietary APIs, like Philips Hue's or Nest's. That means you could, in theory, set up Xandem to trigger your Philips Hue lights based on where you are in the house. A motion-sensing light setup could be a big step in the direction of practical smart-home living, but it will take careful timing and clever balancing to avoid potential annoyances.

Although official partnerships with some smart-home developers are in the works, CEO Joey Wilson isn't ready to reveal any specifics on them.

Xandem Technology's tomographic approach to motion detection seems really creative, and Wilson assured me that the hardware and firmware necessary for Xandem Home is already in place. I am curious, though, about the particulars of the system. Will installation really be as simple as plugging in the nodes and sketching the architecture of your home on your mobile device? Will the nodes be able to distinguish between a pet running through the hallway at night and an intruder?

Xandem Home looks like an interesting entry into the smart home security industry, and it could have an impact on daily life, too. At the steep price of 500 bucks, not to mention the likely addition of annual costs, Xandem might intimidate customers looking for smaller-scale smart home technology integration. But if it works as advertised, and more importantly if it plays nice with other technology, it could be a big addition to the smart home industry.

Check out Xandem Home on Indiegogo, open for preorder at $500 (again, that converts to about £330 and AU$710)."
Fibaro Flood Sensor review:|"

The majority of home insurance policies don't cover flood damage, which can make a flooded basement one of the most costly disasters for homeowners. So depending on where you live, flood sensors can be as important as fire or CO2 detectors. But the Fibaro Flood Sensor aims to be more than just your average moisture detector.

Most moisture sensors on the market, like the SmartThings Sensor or the Aeotec Sensor, alert users when a probe extending from the device comes into contact with water. They send the alerts using low-power communication protocols like Z-Wave or ZigBee -- communication languages that require a hub to translate them into languages your phone can receive, like text messages or push notifications

Fibaro also depends on a Z-Wave hub, and I used SmartThings. But this Flood Sensor features a wider array of design and software features that distinguish it from its competition and contribute to a sleek and versatile product. The biggest drawback of the Fibaro Sensor is its price: at $60 (£55), it costs about one and a half times as much as its connected competitors. But for those who live in a flood plain or whose basements turn into reservoirs every spring, the Fibaro will be well worth the price.

The Fibaro Flood Sensor is easy enough to set up, but the directions are somehow both convoluted and incomplete. For instance, the directions include sections like device specifications, technical information and general info about Fibaro's whole integration system. But they say only this about pairing the device with your Z-Wave hub: ""Use the TMP button to include the Fibaro Flood Sensor into the Z-Wave Network."" What the directions don't say is that you have to press the button three times and screw the top back on, a simple enough procedure that I finally had to call support to figure out.

While Fibaro is working on a quick-start guide that will explain this process for SmartThings users, and its own proprietary home integration system offers directions through the app, I was still baffled by the inadequate paper directions. If Fibaro plans to integrate with other systems in the future, it will need to fix this problem.

Fortunately, the physical setup of the sensor is simple. You can put the Fibaro Flood Sensor wherever a water leak might happen once you've synced up the device to your hub. Unlike flood detectors that have wired probes requiring you to fasten them to the wall or floor in question, you can place the Fibaro right on the ground. I like this approach because it cuts out complications for setup, and the Sensor won't get in the way because most places you'd put it are behind appliances or in basement corners.

The Fibaro Flood Sensor's design is by far its strongest element. The shape, cleverly modeled after a water droplet, is simple and unobtrusive. Some flood sensors, like the one from SmartThings, have plastic legs and two separate probes emerging from the bottom of the sensor body. As a result, these probes are suspended above the surface upon which the sensor rests and can miss dampness.

The bottom of the Fibaro, by contrast, features three gold-plated probes that act as legs for the plastic body. These probes, though small, telescope just enough to account for sloped or otherwise uneven floors. All flood sensors require water to contact two probes, which creates a circuit and alerts the device of a possible flood. The Fibaro's three probes, spread farther apart than many other sensors', allow a slightly greater area to be covered, so the sensors are less likely to miss a small leak.

Inside the Flood Sensor, Fibaro has also streamlined the design. Most users will only use the single button and see the single LED, but a row of terminals also opens up the possibility of creative tech combinations. For example, you can connect the flood sensor to a permanent power source, alarm systems or even a camera that will begin recording when the probes sense water.

I really like the internal terminals for a few reasons. First, you can completely ignore them and still have a solid product. But they also provide options for security expansion at any budget -- from a couple bucks for wires to use as additional probes to a couple hundred for a camera system that will begin recording when a flood starts. The terminals also allow for personalization, so the needs of a variety of users -- from the casual consumer to the intense DIYer -- can be met. The directions even provide helpful diagrams for setting up these integrations.

This unlikely combination of streamlined interface and optional build-out capabilities, along with nice touches like flotation and a beeping alarm, make the Fibaro Flood Sensor a balanced and exciting addition to a smart-home setup.

While the Fibaro boasts a clever design, it is a little too light on features. It senses water about as well as any other moisture detector on the market, which is to say, you'll get an alert if water is touching two of its probes. But where Fibaro could've distinguished itself with a humidity sensor or some other feature to improve its flood sensing focus, it instead measures temperature with surprising specificity (e.g., this morning the house was precisely 71.46 degrees F).

The one creative feature is a tilt sensor that alerts users if the Fibaro is removed from where it is supposed to be. While I appreciate this feature -- especially given that this Sensor is not anchored to a wall or floor like some others -- it only works half the time. If the Fibaro is flipped over, it will almost always beep and alert you to its displacement, but if it is bumped and slides away, it rarely alerts you.

Overall, though the Fibaro's tilt sensor might distinguish it from some competitors, it simply doesn't contribute enough to its flood sensing capabilities to make much difference.

Put simply, the Fibaro Flood Sensor works well. It detects water, integrates with SmartThings and has impressive Z-Wave range. Although the build-out functions might be intimidating to casual consumers, the Fibaro's flexibility makes it a good investment for anyone hoping to put together a home disaster security system. The only feature that suffered some glitches when I was working with it was the tilt sensor, which has limited functionality.

If you need a sensor for a particular drain -- and that's all -- then I'd recommend one of the $40 ones you can get from SmartThings or Aeon Labs. But for most other people, the Fibaro is a solid buy -- especially if you live in a flood plain, if your pipes are prone to burst, or if your basement floods often."
Korner Home Security review:|"

Fun fact: my CNET Appliances colleague Andrew Gebhart and I were once college roommates. We lived together in a six-bedroom house with four other friends during our senior year at Northwestern University back in 2008. It was a fun time, but our place wasn't in the greatest neighborhood -- sure enough, we had a problem with break-ins.

Andrew and I didn't have a lot of home security options back then. After all, we were broke college students living off of ramen noodles and peanut butter, and an expensive, feature-packed security system wasn't feasible for our budgets. Even if it had been, we were renters, and our dear landlord wasn't keen on hardwiring a system into the home, especially not one with a lengthy contract attached.

That's how I know there's definitely a market for a product like Korner, which offers relatively inexpensive home security without a complicated installation or a long-term contract. It's far from the first product in the smart DIY security space, but it might be the simplest -- just stick the motion-sensing tabs on your doors and windows, then plug the siren-emitting base into your router. To arm and disarm the system, you'll use a free app on your phone. That's it -- no cameras, no additional accessories, no live monitoring.

That approach is probably too simple for a lot of homes, and you'll need to pay a yearly fee of $40 (a little over £25) in order to keep using the system after your first year, making it less of a good deal in the long term than a fee-free option like  iSmartAlarm  or  Piper NV . Still, at less than $100 for a three-tag starter kit (converted, about £65), I think Korner merits consideration for people who just want a basic level of security covering the entrances into their home. At the very least, I think Korner would have probably scared off the intruder who forced our bathroom window open in the middle of the night back in 2008 -- that's enough for me to say there's a place for it in today's market.

Most open/close sensors take a two-piece approach, with a sensor on the door or window frame and a magnet on the door or window itself. When the door opens, it separates the two and triggers the sensor. Korner tacks in a different direction. Each triangular tag is a single skinny, sharp-cornered piece of white plastic with a simple accelerometer packed inside. Whenever the door or window moves, Korner senses it. If your system is armed, that motion will set off the alarm.

There are pros and cons to this approach. The upside is that Korner's tags look a lot better than their magnetic counterparts, almost all of which are clunky-looking smart-home eyesores. Compared with those, Korner's tags looks downright svelte. If your doors and windows are painted white, you might actually forget that they're there -- you can't say that about traditional contact sensors.

The downside is that Korner's tags aren't quite as smart as the alternative. With magnetic sensors, you can check whether a door or window is open or closed; with Korner's tags, you'll only know if it's moving or not. Another important caveat: if you open a door with a Korner tag stuck on it very slowly, you'll be able to sneak through without setting off the alarm. You can't do that with magnetic contact sensors. Once the magnet is separated from the sensor, the alarm gets tripped, no matter how slowly that separation happens.

The other system component is the ""Korner Stick,"" a combination base station and siren that you'll stick directly into the back of your router, then plug into power via Micro-USB port. It isn't nearly as clean-looking a design as the tags, and it eats up a good deal of room behind the router, so make sure you save some space.

Along with the siren, the Korner Stick houses a ZigBee radio, which lets it communicate with and keep tabs on your tags. Korner's team acknowledges that ZigBee devices can be hacked if they aren't careful about how they pass data back and forth, and insists that they keep things secure by encrypting and rotating network keys, among other safeguards.

Once the Stick's plugged in, you follow the app's instructions to get everything set up. The app isn't the most attractive-looking I've ever seen, but it's fairly intuitive, and easy enough to get started with. I had my three-tag system up and running within about 5 minutes.

Once everything is connected, you'll be able to monitor the status of each tag on the app's home screen, or arm and disarm the system by tapping on a lock icon. You'll also find a time-stamped activity log on the home screen -- a handy way to keep track of comings and goings.

The gear icon at the bottom of the app brings up system settings. You'll be able to edit the names of your devices, turn on a door entry chime or customize how long an exit delay you get after arming the system.

I would like to see a few more features here -- namely, a way to customize the sensitivity of the sensors. As of now, you can't, which isn't reassuring for anyone who's concerned about that slow-entry method.  You can't adjust the siren volume, either. It's quite loud, though I suppose that's what you want in the event of a break-in.

One feature you will find: a ""Circle Feed."" Essentially, it's a place where you can add contacts to your setup -- a neighbor, friend or family member, perhaps. If the alarm ever goes off, you can choose between notifying the police or notifying your Circle. You can also set the system to email those contacts automatically if something's ever amiss.

You also have the option of adding an extender to your setup. Each extender costs an extra $40, and looks like the Korner Stick without the Ethernet jack. Plug it in, and it'll increase the reach of your system, while also providing an additional siren. I ended up needing to use one in the CNET Smart Home, where the front door is a little over 50 feet away from the router. It worked as promised, though I would have been happier not to need it at all. Unless you live in a smallish apartment, plan on needing at least one extender.

Korner is a simple security system that's designed to do just one thing: monitor movement at your doors and windows. Fortunately it does that one thing pretty well. In all of my tests, opening doors and windows with Korner tags attached and the system armed resulted in a near-instantaneous alarm event, complete with an ear-piercing screech from the sirens. I was also happy that the alarm notifications always arrived swiftly on my phone -- even when I had Wi-Fi turned off.

When the alarm sounds, you'll open the app to find your home screen replaced with an ""intrusion"" screen. You get four options here -- a mute button that shuts the siren off, a lock button that disarms the entire system, a button that'll call the police for you and a ""quick action"" button that'll send a message to the people in your security circle.

Take a close look at those screenshots, though. The one on the left shows the initial push notification about an alarm event. It's informative, telling you not only that there's a problem, but also where the problem is (the basement door, in this case.)

Now look at picture No. 2. That's what you see when you open the app to respond to the problem. It doesn't say anything about the basement door anywhere. You have to disarm the system in order to see the activity log, where the basement door is listed as the problem spot. That's not ideal -- if your alarm goes off in the middle of the night, and you groggily unlock your phone without reading the full notification, then you won't know where the intrusion is coming from. Fortunately, this seems like a pretty simple software fix -- hopefully Korner will tweak this in the near future.

The only other noteworthy issue I ran into was that I wasn't always able to arm the system on my first try when my phone was off of the local Wi-Fi network. When you tap the button to arm, you get a little countdown window that gives you time to get out. Occasionally, when I tested with Wi-Fi off, the system wouldn't actually arm at the end of that countdown. In each instance, it was always fairly obvious that something wasn't working (an ""arming pending"" notification wouldn't appear on the screen), and it always worked on the second try. Still, it's something you'd want to make a habit of keeping an eye out for.

As of now, Korner isn't integrated with any third-party smart home platforms or devices. I'd like to see some development here -- an IFTTT channel or compatibility with an established platform like SmartThings would allow people to use Korner in more creative and comprehensive setups. Right now, it's walled off. Another complaint -- the lack of a keychain or keypad accessory for arming and disarming the system without need for your phone.

Aside from that, the Korner system works as promised, reliably sounding an alarm each and every time I expected it to. None of the tags dropped its signal during my testing, and I never had any issues with false alarms. As a basic, bare-bones approach to home security, it does a fine job.

The Korner Home Security system is certainly a lot less expensive than more full-featured systems, and, most importantly, I think you can rely on it to go off when you need it to, provided you've got tags on all of your doors and windows. With just three tags for $98, I'm not sure that the starter kit would be enough for anything but the smallest of residences -- most people who'd buy this would almost certainly want to add additional tags for $25 each, along with perhaps a $40 extender or two.

That and the yearly fee of $40 after the first year undercut Korner's angle as a budget-friendly security option. Systems like iSmartAlarm and gadgets like Piper NV cost more up front, but they carry no fees, making them better deals within just a few years. Korner is the kind of product I wished existed back in 2008, and I'm glad it's an option for the Andrews and Rys of 2015. But it isn't the only option, and it isn't the best one."
Neato Botvac Connected Robot Vacuum review:|"

Before smartphones, before the cloud, before the Internet of Things was a thing, there was the robot vacuum. It's a smart-home product that predates the app-centric Gordian Knot of platforms and standards that is the modern connected home. A robot vacuum's definition of ""smart"" is simply to clean the cat hair off of your rugs without tumbling down the stairs in the process.

At least, it was. Now, a new crop of app-enabled ""smart"" robot vacuums is navigating into the picture, including the Wi-Fi-equipped Neato Botvac Connected. Pair it with its app on your Android or iOS device, and you'll be able to start, schedule, and even steer it right from your phone -- a welcome addition for a brand that, across all of its models to date, has yet to offer a remote control with any of its cleaners.

At $700 (or £549 in the UK), the Botvac Connected is Neato's most expensive robot vacuum yet, costing $200 more than its unconnected predecessors in the Botvac D Series. However, it's also $200  	less than the connected version of iRobot's Roomba -- and it beat that Roomba in every test we ran. The same can be said for the app-enabled Dyson 360 Eye, which costs $1,000, but never bested Neato. In fact, in the majority of our tests, the Neato Botvac Connected beat out the entire field of robot vacs. It also features a new and improved lithium ion battery, a legitimate step up from the nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries of before.

Robot vacuums were brainy to begin with, and I wouldn't blame you for scoffing at the addition of app controls (or the price increase). But make no mistake: this is the best robot vacuum Neato has ever made, and the best robot vacuum money can currently buy.

The Botvac Connected sticks with the design of the existing line of Botvac models, with only minor tweaks to the color scheme. It's the same, D-shaped cleaner with the same brushrolls, the same accessories, and the same general approach to covering your floors.

That approach sends the Botvac out around the perimeter of the room, where it'll feel its way along the walls with a side-sweeping brush to tidy up the edges. From there, it'll use its laser-assisted navigation capabilities to sweep back and forth across the center of the room, nimbly dodging your furniture as it goes. When it's finished, it'll automatically return to its docking station for a recharge.

Those navigation capabilities seem to be somewhat refined in the connected model. Older Neatos were too efficient for their own good, sweeping along the walls and then covering the center of each room in a single back-and-forth pass. In smaller rooms and spaces, the Botvac Connected is more thorough: it sweeps the center of the room in both rows  	and columns, and edges along the walls multiple times, too.

That gives the Neato ample opportunity to pick up any debris it might miss on a single pass, though cleaning runs take a little longer as a result. I'm fine with that trade-off -- if the Neato is doing its thing while I'm away at work, I want it to take all of the time it needs.

Also new with the connected Neato: cleaning modes. In addition to the default, full-powered ""Turbo"" mode, you can now flip over into a power-saving ""Eco"" mode, too. You'll lose a little bit of suction power, but cleaning runs won't drain the battery as quickly, and the Neato will run a little quieter, too.

You can switch between modes or set up scheduled cleaning runs by tapping through the settings on Neato's color LCD screen, but if you'd rather not hunch over, you can also just pull up the Neato app on your Android or iOS device.

The Neato app is the shiny new addition to the Botvac experience, and a big part of why this vacuum costs $200 more than the previous generation. Thankfully, the app is pretty terrific. It's clean-looking, it's easy-to-use and it works like a charm.

You'll start by activating the Wi-Fi radio on the vacuum itself. It'll broadcast a signal that your smart phone can join up with -- from there, you'll jump back into the app, reselect your home Wi-Fi network, and watch as everything finishes pairing up. I got an error message during this last part on my first attempt, but as soon as I started the process again, things instantly synced right up. A tiny hiccup at best.

With the vacuum cleaner tethered to your home's Wi-Fi network, Neato will ask you to give it a name. I went with ""Roger,"" then told Roger to start a cleaning run. Roger got to work without delay, and when he returned to the charging station, he sent me a push notification letting me know he was finished.

You can also log on to Neato's website if you want to do more than just give your robot vacuum a name. You can register its serial number, for instance, or save a photo of your proof of purchase. That's a handy way to be prepared in case you ever need to take Neato up on the one-year warranty.

Another feature in the app is a manual cleaning mode that'll let you steer the Neato around like a toy car.  The controls work well enough, and they might be a lot of fun if you can get your cat to climb aboard. Still, the feature isn't terribly useful for much more than steering the Neato over to a messy spot, then switching it over to the automated spot-cleaning mode.

Despite the clean, easy-to-use interface, the simplicity of the app leaves room for improvement. For instance, you won't find usage statistics that track how long each cleaning run takes (or how much of the battery each one uses). You also won't see the specifics when things go wrong. If the brush is jammed or the robot gets caught on a piece of furniture, the app won't let you know -- at best, you'll see the vacuum's status listed as ""error"" if something is preventing you from starting a cleaning run remotely. In most cases, you'll still need to hunch over and look at the vacuum's LCD screen to see what that specific error is.

We run lots and lots and lots of cleaning tests when we evaluate robot vacuums. There are different types of floors to test on, different types of debris to test with, and different cleaning modes to test out. All in all, I sullied and cleaned over 30 floors with the Neato Botvac Connected, carefully weighing the results of each run. And I've come away convinced that it's the best performer we've ever seen.

Let's start with rice -- a good analog for the typical crumbs and clutter that you'll find on a floor in need of a good cleaning. We sprinkle 2.5 ounces of it onto each flooring surface we want to test, then let the robo vac do its thing. When it's done, we weigh what it picked up, then clean out the bin, give the floor a thorough cleaning, and run the test again. After three runs, we take the average, then move onto the next flooring surface.

Neato cleaned up in more ways than one. On all three surfaces we test -- plushy midpile carpet, berber-style low-pile carpet, and hardwood -- the Neato Botvac Connected posted a higher average than any other robot vacuum we've ever tested. That includes our first ever perfect score on hardwood (and our first perfect rice score on any surface).

I also ran the tests with the Neato switched over into Eco mode. It did seem to run a bit quieter, though only slightly, but it still performed well, managing another perfect score on hardwood and a slight downtick to 2.35 ounces on low-pile carpet. And midpile carpet? In Eco mode, the Neato actually exceeded the Turbo average of 2.48, instead scoring a perfect 2.50.

Next up: pet hair. A local groomer kindly donated a trash bag full of the stuff (shampooed before trimming, thankfully). For our purposes, we spread a fifth of an ounce of it across each of our test floors, then see how much each robot vacuum can sweep up.

Again, the Botvac Connected performed admirably, essentially finishing in a dead heat at the top of the leaderboard with Neato's previous generation cleaner, the Botvac D85. Its perfect score on midpile carpet was another first among the cleaners we've tested.

Those scores ticked down a bit in Eco mode, though. The Neato still managed a perfect score on hardwood, but could only get about three fourths of the fluff into the bin on both carpets. However, the floors all still looked clean to the naked eye, which raises a question. Where did that other 0.05 ounce of hair go?

The answer, as you might suspect, is that it didn't make it past the brushroll. With the motor running slower than before, the Neato didn't have quite enough suction power to keep the hair from clinging to those brushroll fibers, and created a bit of a tangled mess. It wasn't too terrible to yank the stuff out, and in fairness, the Neato comes with a handy multitool to help with this exact chore. Still, it was annoying enough that I'd steer clear of Eco mode if I had pets to clean up after.

Our final test is to see how well each vacuum can sweep up 1.25 ounces of sand. This is our most challenging test -- particularly on the carpets, where no cleaner to date has yet managed to pick up even half of what we throw down.

The Neato Botvac Connected struggled similarly, finishing more or less in a tie for third with the XV Signature Pro, a Neato cleaner that we first tested back in 2013. The strongest performer here is still the iRobot Roomba 880, which costs about the same as the Botvac Connected.

On the other hand, the app-enabled Roomba 980 -- the Botvac Connected's closest competitor -- finished towards the back of the pack. Despite selling for $200 more than the Botvac Connected, the Roomba 980 ended the day getting outperformed by Neato at every turn.

Robot vacuums aren't perfect cleaners, and the Neato is no different. It wasn't able to handle a particularly shaggy, inch-thick living room rug in the CNET Smart Home, for instance. And, though I was impressed with how intelligently and consistently it navigated around our test floors, it occasionally finished a run earlier than expected, or needed me to come and pick a wad of pet hair out of its brushroll.

We also ran into trouble with the Neato Botvac Connected's floor sensor. Pick the thing up, and you'll see a polite little message on the screen asking you to put it back down on the floor -- same as all Neatos that came before it.

About halfway through our tests though, that sensor seemed to get stuck. After picking the Neato up and putting it back on the ground, the message refused to go away. I tapped the ""okay"" button about a hundred times, and tried everything from jimmying the wheels to rebooting the system. Nothing worked, and I was forced to continue my testing with a second unit (I named this one ""Roger Two."")

Neato tells me that Roger One was an early production unit, and was likely affected by a design flaw with the vacuum chassis that they claim has since been fixed. I wasn't able to replicate the problem with Roger Two, which is a good sign, and the one-year warranty offers a good deal of reassurance. Still, if you wanted to wait to hear some of the early customer feedback before making a purchase, I wouldn't blame you.

For $700, the Neato Botvac Connected offers unrivaled cleaning performance and the long overdue addition of remote controls via a well-designed app. It isn't just the best Neato yet -- it's the best robot vacuum to date, and the one I would buy if I were buying one today.

If you're willing to live without remote controls, you can save some money by going with a $500 cleaner from the last generation of Neato Botvacs. It also might make sense to wait and see if any of the emerging crop of connected robot vacuums ends up integrating in some useful way with an existing smart-home platform like Amazon Alexa or Apple HomeKit. But for now, the Neato Botvac Connected is the best buy of the bunch, and a deserving winner of our Editors' Choice Award distinction."
iDevices Thermostat review:|"

At the CNET Smart Home, one of the easiest gadgets to forget about is our Nest Learning Thermostat -- and that's a good thing. When we arrive in the morning, the home has already changed from its energy saving 65 degrees to 71 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature our staff prefers. Throughout the day, if Nest senses no one is in the house, it will allow the temperature to drift within a reasonable range to save energy. This is the power of the smart thermostat: it saves you money and keeps you comfortable, all while fading into the background of your daily routine.

The problem with many smart thermostats is they clock in at a pricey $250. So I was excited to hear iDevices, the company behind the iGrill and the Switch -- both solid products -- would be releasing their HomeKit-compatible Thermostat for a mere $150. When I got my hands on it, though, I was disappointed to find the Thermostat software lacking major features that would classify it as ""smart."" While the device will certainly develop as Apple HomeKit grows (according to developers, the hardware is already capable of Bluetooth connectivity and geo-fencing, pending software updates), right now the Thermostat is only worth it for those willing to invest in HomeKit's future.

After seeing some of the more creative solutions of recent smart thermostats, I was a little disappointed by the surprisingly standard setup of the iDevices product. The Nest Learning Thermostat, for example, provides nodes for your wires to plug into -- nodes that you can clamp shut with the push of a button. The iDevices Thermostat by contrast requires you to screw in the wires using a tiny screwdriver (not included).

When I installed the Thermostat for the first time, it didn't work. The temperature drifted upward and the controls had no effect on it. After examining the directions again, I discovered I'd missed something: I had to enter information about our particular HVAC system into the Thermostat's menu. This process surprised me, since other smart thermostats bypass it by analyzing your wiring. Not only did I have to know what kind of HVAC we have (a gas-powered, heat pump system), I also had to look up the type of reversing valve it uses (O-type).

Setting up thermostats can be complicated, and the iDevices Thermostat certainly didn't make it easier. I was disappointed nothing on the app or the Thermostat screen told me it had defaulted to a non-heat pump system, and I didn't even know anything was amiss until a few hours later when the house was uncomfortably warm.

The Thermostat's design looks nice -- from a distance. Its glossy white face will fit with more contemporary home decors, and the four buttons around the small rectangular screen are touch sensitive. This means that, despite the smaller screen, your hands will never get in the way of seeing the menus. The button placement even gives a cool visual structure to the device that some purely touchscreen devices lack.

Once I started using the Thermostat, though, I realized the button placement, while aesthetically pleasing, was inefficient. The button used for both ""settings"" and ""select,"" for example, is located in the upper left corner where ""back"" buttons are usually placed. As a result, more than once when I wanted to go ""back,"" I accidentally touched the ""select"" button, opening a new menu I had to exit. This, among other small problems, made navigating the Thermostat interface a little cumbersome.

The menu system on the Thermostat is also oddly inefficient. Rather than learning from the menu systems of competitors, like the Ecobee3 Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat, that pair clever graphics with only-when-necessary text, the iDevices Thermostat features a menu tree of monochromatic visuals and lists. The text is even pixelated and bland, so what should feel like a new device instead strikes me as already dated.

Setup can be a pain for any thermostat, and every consumer will have different design tastes, but the quality of a smart thermostat is largely measured by its smart features. In other words, why pay more for a thermostat unless it's going to be somehow different from what you already own?

Companies like Honeywell, which have long histories in the thermostat industry, have worked to differentiate newer smart thermostats from older simpler models. They do so by offering features like geofencing to tell your thermostat you're coming home. Some boast algorithms to learn your personal heating and cooling patterns, so you don't have to log them yourself. Still others work with triggers (facilitated by apps like IFTTT), so unlocking your front door can tell you're thermostat you're home, and turning off all your lights can tell your thermostat you're ready for bed.

The iDevices Thermostat doesn't do any of these things. Its app interface looks oddly empty beside other iDevices products, like the Outdoor Switch pictured above. It doesn't sense whether anyone's home. In fact, its only feature I'd call smart is remote control.

Of course, the iDevices Thermostat integrates with HomeKit, which means you can control it with Siri while you're home, and you can schedule temperature changes to reflect your daily regimen. But iDevices isn't the only thermostat developer featuring HomeKit compatibility. The HomeKit-compatible Ecobee3 -- a smart thermostat that tells you about the weather, home humidity, senses whether you're home or away, and more -- seems to deserve its $250 price tag. The iDevices Thermostat, even at a hundred bucks cheaper, doesn't.

What partially makes up for this Thermostat's sparse features, in my mind, is its potential. As mentioned, it can't do what other smart thermostats do, but it doesn't charge what other smart thermostats charge. So if missing features were to be added or updated in the future, the Thermostat would be a much better deal. Apparently Bluetooth hardware is built into the device, ready to be woken up for later updates. The development team at iDevices hopes to introduce geo-fencing soon, and algorithmic pattern-learning is software updateable. Apple has also announced the introduction of HomeKit triggers for the near future.

So while the features on the iDevices Thermostat are disappointingly absent, the $150 Thermostat could be very competitive if and when these feature updates happen.

For $150, the iDevices Thermostat had better work -- and it does. Once everything is wired and set up, the Thermostat will heat and cool your home as well as your HVAC system allows. The only problem I experienced working with the Thermostat while on the CNET Smart Home Wi-Fi was periodic lags in mobile connection. These never last for more than ten or fifteen seconds, and were likely due to iOS 9's Wi-Fi Assist function, which lets LTE augment device connectivity when Wi-Fi fails.

So the big question: Are the 150 bucks worth remote access and a sleek face? This Thermostat occupies the space between cheaper dumb thermostats and the high-end Ecobees, Honeywells, and Nests that clock in around $250. Right now, the iDevices Thermostat isn't a great buy, but for those willing to wait for HomeKit and iDevices updates, it might not be a bad investment.

But really, why pay now for what won't be coming for a few months? My recommendation: if a hundred bucks doesn't make a difference to you, buy an Ecobee3 or Nest. Otherwise, wait for a more substantial HomeKit software rollout to find out if the iDevices Thermostat should earn your money."
Monkey will be a doorman for apartment dwellers|"

A young startup called Locumi Labs, which made its debut in Germany with a clever mailbag (in German), wants to go international with a new smart security device that specifically targets apartment dwellers. Monkey will ship in the third quarter of 2016 for $119 or £99 (roughly converted, that's AU$155), which is half the price of many smart locks on the market.

Of course, this isn't exactly a smart home lock; it's a batteryless, Wi-Fi-enabled chip housed in a plastic shell, and it's designed to connect your phone to your apartment's intercom. After installing Monkey, which is built to nestle snugly inside your intercom's case, you'll be able to perform many of the same functions as other smart locks, but through the already-present technology of the intercom. But this small connection, according to Locumi's designers, will bring some big changes.

The first and probably most practical tool Monkey will offer is remote access to apartment intercoms. According to Locumi, Monkey will be compatible with nearly all apartment intercoms -- even older models. The app, in development for both iOS and Android, will send push notifications to users when a guest buzzes from the front door of the apartment building. Users, whether home or away, can then buzz in guests using their phone.

Locking and unlocking doors while away from home is a tough topic for many lock developers. From Kwikset to Yale, most use connectivity like Bluetooth or Z-Wave that requires your mobile devices to be near the lock to access it, and these locks often require a separate hub (for a separate price). HomeKit-enabled locks, like August's upcoming second generation lock and the new Schlage Sense, feature remote access using iCloud, but only with the purchase of a third-generation or later Apple TV. The sparseness of remote capabilities is expected -- major security risks arise if a lock is too easily accessible from a distance. But the industry's caution means few companies have done smart lock remote access well, and almost none have done it cheaply.

Monkey could rise to the remote-access challenge because of one key distinction: it doesn't unlock the door of your apartment, but rather the door of your apartment building. So remote access doesn't represent quite the same security risk it does for other locks. Of course, the Wi-Fi communication between Monkey and your phone will be encrypted, and your home network should already be semisecure, but Locumi's primary focus isn't on reinforcing security -- it's on streamlining entry.

One notable feature, for example, is pretty standard for smart locks, but works particularly well for apartment buildings: timed access windows. You can set up certain times during which anyone who buzzes will be allowed access (think: hosting a party with guests dropping by all evening). But Monkey avoids the discomfort of allowing a stranger into your home when you're away by only allowing access to the building. That way delivery people can easily leave packages outside your apartment door, but inside the building and sheltered from the weather.

Another feature of convenience is the hands-free user entry. The Monkey app will use geofencing to track when your device approaches your apartment building, and a GPS will tell Monkey to buzz you in when you're within a few meters of your front door. The idea of automatic entry is appealing for anyone who hates fumbling with keys at your building entryway and again at your apartment door. But if Monkey's GPS is anything like the one I use when I'm driving, I'm skeptical of how well this function will work. Ultimately, we'll have to wait until we get our hands on the product to know how it performs.

Overall I like the approach of Locumi's project: home security more focused on how to let people in than how to keep them out. That inversion leaves space for real creativity -- addressing issues particular to apartment dwellers like me, who must use keys for two different entryways when they come home. This could also be a relief for renters with dogs that go crazy every time a visitor rings the buzzer. But the Monkey also raises many questions: Will a finicky GPS compromise my building's security? Will the app's remote connection lead to latency problems? Will the Wi-Fi connection be secure enough? Although Locumi assures us Monkey will not jeopardize an apartment building's security, any doubts (and hopes) will have to wait for answers until the product launches next year."
Axis Gear built to make any shade or window blind smart|"

It's hard to imagine a smart home without motorized window shades and self-adjusting blinds. Unfortunately it's hard to track down smart window treatments that aren't either extremely expensive, require a specially qualified installer or both. Startup company Axis says it has a solution, the $195 Axis Gear.

Designed to convert any existing shade or blinds apparatus into one that's automatic and smart, the Gear squeezes all the essential components to manipulate window dressings independently into a small wall-mounted box. This includes an electric motor, rechargeable battery, light sensor, even a solar panel to provide a cordless power source.

Though it may sound like the name for some sort of a fearful doomsday weapon, the Axis Gear unit is in fact envisioned as physically sleek, compact, even elegant. A white rectangle with silver highlights, the gadget is also meant to unobtrusively attach lengthwise and vertically alongside widows.

The top-most edge of the Gear houses a receptacle in which you insert the beaded chains or corded loops from your current shades and blinds. Once properly hooked up, the Gear then has the power to open and close blinds or raise and lower shades on command. Axis plans on offering many methods for operating the Gear too, the simplest being a capacitive touch control on the front face of the product.

There's an embedded Bluetooth radio as well, which Axis says enables the Gear to wirelessly communicate with smartphones within the home. What I find most intriguing, however, is the Gear's light sensor. This electronic eye will conceivably enable the Gear to automatically shut the drapes at night and open them during the day -- or vice versa.

Also interesting is that Axis claims the Gear will, ""integrate with leading smart home systems and other connected devices."" As to which specific platforms and products these will be remains unclear as is the stated time frame of, ""in the coming months"" which is vague to say the least.

If you're itching to get your hands on an Axis Gear unit, you'll have to be patient. While the product's Indigogo campaign has just officially launched, Axis doesn't expect to sell the product to ordinary consumers until ""late 2016."" Of course if you support the Gear's crowd sourced funding project to the tune of $95, you'll enjoy a substantial discount over the regular $195 retail sticker price.

Axis better hustle to bring its gadget to market though because other companies have big plans to play in the smart window space. For example, another startup, MySmartBlinds (previously TiltMyBlinds), is working on a similar crowdfunded product that was originally slated to ship in October 2015.

Another solution, the  Somfy MyLink , requires a professional installer but its shades are available now and can be controlled via mobile app. There's always the reigning king of the automated and shade and lighting empire, Lutron, which makes the Serena line of remote controlled window shades. Of course while this option does offer smartphone control via the  Lutron Smart Bridge hub  device, the motorized shades themselves are only available through official channels and are strictly not DIY."
Philips Hue 2.0 Starter Kit review:|"

Today's smart home is  a veritable mish-mash of products and platforms, and sorting out what works with what isn't easy. Unless, of course, we're talking about Philips Hue's color-changing smart bulbs, which work with just about everything --  Google's Nest Thermostat,  Samsung SmartThings ,  IFTTT ,  Amazon Echo,  Wink , you name it.

Now, thanks to  a new version of the Hue Bridge , they'll work with Apple HomeKit, too. A set of smart-home protocols built into iPhone and iPad operating systems, HomeKit brings voice-activated Siri controls into play -- and keeps Philips Hue firmly ahead of the curve in terms of compatibility with key third parties.

In addition to the new bridge, Philips Hue's $200 starter kits now come packaged with updated bulbs, too (the new kits aren't available outside of the US just yet, but the existing ones sell for £150/AU$290). Unlike the original bulbs, which won't shine any brighter than 600 lumens, the second-gen versions go up to 800 lumens, finally hitting 60-watt equivalence. The rub is that you only get that extra brightness at certain color temperatures -- and not at the default, 2,700K setting. The colors also aren't any better than the original bulbs, and suffer from the same weak spots, like yellowy green tones and purplish blues. If you were hoping that generation two would bring you noticeably better bulbs (or noticeably less expensive ones), then you'll be disappointed.

Still, supporting HomeKit is a logical next step for the brand, and it's one worth getting excited about if you're an iOS user who's long dreamed of the day when Siri could control your lights. That, coupled with its wide compatibility with other third-party smart-home systems, keeps Philips Hue on top for now, but less expensive competitors like Lifx are starting to close the gap.

Philips didn't make any drastic changes to its smart lighting kit for generation two. In fact, I hesitate to call this a second generation product at all. You still get three Hue bulbs and a bridge, and you'll still control them using the same Philips Hue app on your Android or iOS device. Aside from the compatibility with HomeKit, there isn't any new functionality here, nothing you can do with this kit that you couldn't do with the old one.

Of course, the corollary is true, as well. Philips didn't take a step backwards, either. We've seen other products sacrifice some of the tricks up their sleeve in order to fall in line with Apple -- an Insteon HomeKit Hub that only controls certain Insteon products, for instance. There's nothing like that here. Philips managed to get all of the benefits of HomeKit without compromising the core strengths of the Hue platform.

Among those strengths: Hue's open approach to software, which allows third party developers to make their own control apps for the lights, and potentially bring new functionality into play. That's brought about a wealth of apps that work with Hue, and plenty of ways to play with the lights and keep things fresh.

The counterpoint to that approach is that it might have made Hue's team a little bit lazy. Features that have become more or less standard with the competition, like a music sync mode or customizable color cycles, are still conspicuously absent from the Hue app. Instead, you'll have to find a third-party app that gets the job done. That was a forgivable way of doing things with generation one, but for generation two, it would have been nice to see the app get a refresh.

It didn't. It's the same old Hue app you've always used, and you'll still change the color of your bulbs using the same tedious drag-and-drop display that forces you to cover the part of the spectrum you're trying to land on with your finger as you try and land on it. Call it Hue-bris, maybe, but Philips didn't seem to think that the app merited improvement for generation two. I think it did, and I was disappointed not to get it.

All that said, it would be a mistake to brush off the new generation's addition of HomeKit support. With open standards for how smart-home devices should communicate within iOS, HomeKit compatibility makes it easy for other products to integrate Hue controls into their own control apps. That means that you'll be able to program lighting changes that are tied directly to those other products -- lights that come on when you lock your door, for instance.

And sure, you could already do a lot of that by syncing your lights with a master hub like SmartThings' or an automation system like IFTTT -- but HomeKit brings Siri into the picture. Voice-activated, on-demand lighting changes are a natural fit for the system, and a great step forward -- especially given how hard it is to pick out a particular color using the Hue app's color selector. Asking Siri to turn the lights fuchsia is a lot easier.

At the launch of Philips Hue 2.0, Siri could only understand the most basic of colors, but Apple's already given her a vocabulary upgrade. Aside from red, blue, and orange, you can request crimson, teal, and gold, among a score of others. Siri can also understand some modifiers -- ""light blue"" works, for instance. She can't yet understand anything on the white light spectrum, though: ask for ""soft white,"" ""daylight,"" or ""2,700K,"" and Siri just looks at you funny. My guess is that Apple updates that before long -- Siri doesn't require a full iOS update in order to learn new words.

You'll also be able to use Siri to control your Hue scenes, which let you trigger multiple bulbs at once. Hue scenes aren't programmed in the same way as HomeKit scenes, so they won't work at first. The fix is simple, though -- just go to your Hue's app's settings and select ""Siri voice control."" You'll see a list of your scenes; just tap the ones that you want to control using Siri, and Hue will translate them into something Siri can work with.

Your other option is to create new scenes using an app that follows HomeKit's scene-creation protocols in the first place. While it might be a little odd to program your Hue lights outside of the Hue app, doing so will allow you to create more complicated scenes that involve your other HomeKit-compatible gadgets. A ""goodnight"" scene could turn the lights off and lock your door, for instance.

Of course, you'll need to upgrade to the new bridge before you'll be able to do any of this. Fortunately, Hue now offers a ""bridge transfer"" mode in the app that makes it easy to make the switch. Just follow the onscreen instructions, and Hue will save your existing settings in the cloud, then load them into the new bridge. It only took me a few minutes to get things switched over in the CNET Smart Home, and after doing so, my lights and scenes remained intact. The Siri-powered voice controls worked well, aside from the occasional language mixup (she often hears ""Hugh"" when you say ""Hue,"" for instance).

There was one unexpected casualty with the switch, though:  Hue's integration with the voice-activated Amazon Echo smart speaker, which we already had up and running here at the CNET Smart Home. The new bridge won't currently let the Echo talk to your lights -- Philips tells us that they're working with Amazon on a fix.

The new Hue LEDs, now dubbed ""Hue white and color,"" offer more brightness (and a slightly higher wattage) than the existing versions. Whereas the old bulbs could only hit a maximum of 600 lumens, putting them awkwardly in between the 40 and 60-watt replacement level, the new ones go all the way up to the 60-watt benchmark of 800 lumens.

At least, they're supposed to. Turn them on at their default, soft white setting of 2,700K, and they still shine at less than 600 lumens -- same as the old bulbs. The same is true as you cycle through the RGB spectrum. None of the colors get up above 600  lumens. The worst is blue, which only offers 27 lumens' worth of brightness.

It's only when you dial the bulbs up above that yellowy color temperature of 2,700K toward the hotter, whiter daylight tones that you hit anything north of 600. The brightest spot of the spectrum seems to be around 4,000K. Testing it out in our integrating sphere, the best reading I was able to get was 734 lumens at a measured color temperature of 3,870K. And keep in mind that the color selector in the Hue app doesn't include color temperature readings -- you're really just eyeballing it.

Something else worth considering is color accuracy. After all, if you're going to spend big bucks on color-changing lighting, then it's fair to expect those colors to shine true. This was a nitpick of mine with the original Hue bulbs -- they did fine with reds and yellows but had a hard time putting out accurate, vivid blue and green tones.

Unfortunately, the new bulbs aren't any better than the old ones. In fact, at almost every color and tone it's just about impossible to tell them apart. The green setting is still tennis-ball green at best, the blue setting still has a purplish tinge to it, and the cyan or light blue part of the spectrum still gets completely washed out with white light.

The reason for this all comes down to diodes. Crack a Hue bulb open, and you'll find an mix of light-producing diodes. Red and yellow are both well represented, but you only get two blue diodes. That's why Hue bulbs come in so dim at the blue setting, and also why the blue setting looks a little bit purple: Philips bumps the brightness by adding in a touch of red.

Green is the more obvious problem area. Compare the Hue version of green with what you'll get from a color-changing bulb with a greater number of blue diodes, like  Lifx , and the difference is night and day. You can see that exact comparison for yourself in  the gallery of images posted above -- from left to right in each shot, you're looking at the old Hue, the new Hue and Lifx. Set to green, Lifx is the clear winner. The same can be said for the cyan setting -- it's a color the Hue bulbs just can't produce.

Again, all of these faults were a lot more forgivable with Philips Hue's first generation. A lot's changed since then, though. Along with Lifx, competitors like  iLumi  have emerged, along with color-tunable, white-light-only bulbs like the ones you'll find in the  Osram Lightify Starter Kit . Philips Hue costs more than all of them. If generation two was an opportunity to stay competitive by either improving the color quality or cutting the price, Philips missed it.

Hue's interoperability is still its trump card. If you have a variety of smart-home gadgets, and you want color-changing bulbs that will work with as many of them as possible, Hue can't be beat. If you're an existing Hue user and an iOS user as well, then upgrading to the new Hue Bridge to add Siri controls to your setup is a no-brainer, especially considering that Philips will let you trade in your old bridge for a $20 discount.

But if you haven't bought in with Philips Hue yet, I'm not sure that there's enough here to get you to do so now. At $200, the cost of getting started is still is just as high, and there's really nothing new to get excited about beyond that HomeKit integration. What's more, the competition is starting to get compelling.  Lifx  offers brighter bulbs with better color quality and an easier to use app that now cost $60 each. With no hub needed, you can control each one right out of the box, meaning you don't need to plunk down $200 just to get started. To me, that seems like the better choice for anyone who just wants to try out color-changing light."
GE Plug-In Outdoor Smart Switch review:|"

The smart switch is the perfect example of a  smart-home device meant to fade into the background, to become invisible  until you need it, when its only evidence is efficiency. But this  simple effect requires a delicate balance -- one many developers have  struggled to strike.

GE is one of the major companies in pursuit  of quiet excellence, but unlike competitors' products like the iDevices  Outdoor Switch, GE's Z-Wave Plug-In Outdoor Smart Switch requires that you  already own a Z-Wave gateway. I chose to look at the Switch's performance  with two we already had: Piper and SmartThings.

When you look at the smart switch market, the GE Outdoor Smart  Switch, now available online and at most home improvement retailers for $40, is a steal  -- if you already own a Z-Wave gateway. That means if you're just  looking for a smart switch that won't force you to take the home integration plunge,  this isn't the product for you. The Switch's functions work well for the most part: you can control it while  you're off the Wi-Fi network, and schedules work as expected. So if you have SmartThings, Piper or another Z-Wave gateway, and you use outdoor electronics like regularly, pick up this Switch.

When  I unpacked the GE Outdoor Smart Switch, a compactly folded direction  sheet was the first thing I saw. The instructions on the sheet were a little  intimidating, what with all its panels of directions and tiny print, but  it turns out the Switch is really easy to set up and synchronize with  your Z-Wave gateway: just plug it in, tell your Piper or hub to search  for a new product, and press the button on the Switch. That's it.

Of  course, from setup to daily use, the Switch is almost completely dependent  upon your home integration system, and chances are, if you like your  Piper, SmartThings hub, or other Z-Wave gateway, then you'll like how  it handles this Switch. For instance, I found the Piper app a little  stiff and not very intuitive at first, but once I figured out the  interface, I could do what I wanted on it. The SmartThings app, by  contrast, was painfully convoluted, and it took me much longer to navigate to  the Switch, let alone to the scheduling interface.

The GE Outdoor Smart Switch won't win any awards for design. A black plastic shell encases the internal electronics, giving the Switch a medium body with no distinguishing characteristics. A simple touch, like a light or even a subtle use of color, could have made this Switch stand out, but right now it looks strictly utilitarian.

The button on the front is small and difficult to completely press, so much of the time I had to wiggle my finger around the button to find the right angle to push. If your fingers are very small, you might not have a problem with this, but it seems like an odd design decision. Another awkward design flaw is the rubber block that covers the outlet while nothing is plugged in. When you do plug something into the GE Smart Switch, this rubber block simply dangles from a thin rubber strap -- a surprisingly delicate connector for an outdoor switch. The bulky rubber block also looks out of place, hanging off the Switch when something is plugged in.

Of course, looking ugly isn't the end of the world for an Outdoor Smart Switch. The question is whether this thing can stand up to the elements. And the answer is right there in the user manual: don't put it in the rain. I was a little baffled when I read it for the first time, because the Switch looks pretty solid. But sure enough, despite being mostly moisture resistant, the button isn't watertight.

Overall, in terms of design, the GE Z-Wave Plug-In Outdoor Smart Switch is about as clunky as its name.

The GE Outdoor Smart Switch is a capable device. It works well with most  Z-Wave gateways, and its features are what you'd expect. You can turn  things on and off, remotely or on the property, and you can schedule  activation times for the Switch.

Although this Switch doesn't include power usage monitoring hardware, like iDevices  or Belkin products, it does include remote control of the Switch that has a surprisingly low latency time. When I was using the Piper NV live-feed camera, I could see the Switch activate within a second of toggling it, even when I was 20 or 30 miles from the CNET Smart Home.

For its price, the GE Outdoor Smart Switch offers fair features, even if it doesn't bring much new to the table.

The GE Switch's performance stood up to scrutiny, but really its performance is contingent upon the app you're using. Again, using the Piper app stunned me, because the Switch responded in only a second or two from miles away. But the SmartThings app had connectivity problems and buttons that sometimes just didn't do what they were supposed to.

One small touch I appreciated was the way scheduled functions worked. With other connected outlets, like the iDevices Switches, a scheduled command would be sent at the moment the clock hit the given time, and if that first command didn't reach the device, then too bad -- your scheduled command didn't work. But using the Piper app with the GE Outdoor Smart Switch, unreceived commands would resend during the first minute of a scheduled action until the Switch responded.

Touches like the scheduling functions and minimal-delay remote control made this Outdoor Switch's performance impressive, despite its basic features.

Overall, the GE Z-Wave Plug-In Outdoor Smart Switch is a good product -- if you already have a Z-Wave gateway. So anyone using Piper or SmartThings can get a deal on the type of product that will cost 50 bucks or more from other developers. For those without a Z-Wave hub, though, this plug is not a good entry point into connected home living.

The biggest problem with this Smart Switch is its physical design. Its baffling lack of a fully rainproof casing is a serious problem. For anyone in a relatively dry climate, the button's unsealed edges will probably not pose much of a problem, but for people who live in rainy areas, this Switch just isn't a reliable option.

I'd recommend this Switch to anyone already using Z-Wave home integration -- it really is a steal for such customers. For others, look elsewhere for standalone smart plugs."
Ezviz Mini review:|"

Back in October, camera retailer Ezviz added a new model to its lineup -- the $70 Ezviz Mini -- a 720p live-streaming Wi-Fi camera with night vision, motion-detection capabilities, local and cloud storage, Web and mobile (Android and iOS) apps and alerts with an included scheduling feature.

Available for purchase now in the US through Amazon and Sam's Club, this pint-sized powerhouse offers a lot of the same features as other do-it-yourself cams for a fraction of the price.

It also works well, with one important exception -- phantom alerts: The camera is supposed to send an alert and record a video clip when it detects motion, but several of the notifications and their related recordings showed no activity whatsoever. And although the Mini doesn't work with devices from other manufacturers or offer an  IFTTT channel, anyone looking for a basic video-streaming cam should consider the $70 Ezviz Mini. (Did I mention that the first year of cloud storage is free?)

Ezviz's $70 camera is tiny (hence the name ""Mini"") -- it clocks in at under 4 ounces and stands just 3.5 inches tall -- so it's about as good as it gets as far as an unobtrusive design. And it has a magnetic base (like  Arlo ,  Nest Cam  and others) and the stand pivots and angles for easy installation.

Using the Ezviz app (available for iOS and Android), setup took about 5 to 10 minutes. To register, enter your country, email address and verification code. (This should appear in the inbox of the address you provide. I found this somewhat confusing, though, because there's a verification code on a sticker on the back of the camera. Ignore it and use the one you receive in your email instead.) Then create a username and a password, scan the QR code on the back of the camera and input your Wi-Fi details as well as your time zone, and you're done. It's a few more steps than most Wi-Fi camera configurations, but it isn't too inconvenient.

While setup was pretty straightforward, the app looks dated. It's still easy enough to navigate, but there's something generally unpolished about it that reminds me of the old-school-style  Foscam Plug and Play Wireless IP Camera FI9826P . Even so, I was able to view the live stream on the iOS app as well as on the web interface, receive motion-related alerts and scroll through the activity log to see saved clips.

The Ezviz Mini comes with a 16GB microSD card for local storage and currently offers users one full year of free cloud storage. If you still want cloud storage after that period, you'll have to pay $5 per month/$50 per year for 7 days of storage or $10 per month/$100 per year for 30 days of storage.

Ezviz's Mini performed well overall. The 720p live streaming video is crisp in both regular and night vision mode and you can set it to either portrait or landscape view (and even monitor up to four cameras simultaneously in ""quad"" view if you happen to have more than one Mini installed). And, you can manually adjust between basic, standard and HD video quality, depending on your bandwidth limitations.

But, there's one issue. The Mini sent me a lot of phantom alerts. This will likely vary by user depending on your install location, but the motion sensor is very sensitive in general. Shadows and other non-security-related movement occasionally sent it into a frenzy -- one night I woke up to alerts popping up on my phone every few minutes -- only to check the saved video clips and realize that no significant motion had taken place.

Then, I responded by disabling the notifications altogether, assuming that most of the alerts I would receive (that particular night, at least) were due to shadows and perhaps the particular spot where it was installed.

After that, I moved the camera to various other locations and never experienced this issue to the same extent, but I still received the occasional phantom alert, which makes its reliability as a security notification device questionable.

$200 is the norm when it comes to buying do-it-yourself high-definition security and webcams these days. One quick tour of our own camera coverage shows that  Nest Cam  (and its  Dropcam Pro  predecessor),  Flir FX ,  Logi Circle ,  Netatmo Welcome and Piper  (the original model, not  the night-vision-equipped version ), all cost 200 bucks. And others, like the  Samsung SmartCam HD Pro ,  ArcSoft Simplicam ,  Homeboy ,  Netgear Arlo  (the two-camera kit we reviewed costs over $300, but you can buy one camera and the hub for just $180) and new  Kodak Video Monitor CFH-V20  are all within $50 of that now-standard retail figure.

Sure, when you're comparing DIY and professional firm camera setups, the DIY route is likely to cost less overall, but there haven't been many cameras that are a true bargain. The $100  Guardzilla  is reasonably-priced, but it has a standard-definition resolution and underwhelming performance -- and that's it as far as models we've reviewed that cost significantly less than $200. That makes the Ezviz Mini truly unique.

But, it doesn't work with any third-party devices or IFTTT, a mobile and web service that connects devices with different manufacturers to one another so you can set rules like, ""If my Homeboy security camera detects motion, then flash my Philips Hue LEDs.""

You really can't go wrong with the $70 Ezviz Mini if you're looking for a basic live-streaming camera. The features you get for the price are incredible -- a 720p HD resolution, night vision and more. However, if you're looking for something with reliable motion alerts that also works with other connected devices, this isn't the product for you. But, with a year of free cloud storage and an included 16GB microSD card, the Ezviz Mini offers the absolute best value of any security camera I've reviewed to date."
No phone? No problem -- August's smart lock gets a keypad|"

The  August Smart Lock  is still our favorite way to bring connected smarts to your front door, and today, it's getting even smarter. Along with  a doorbell camera accessory  and  a new version of the lock  that's compatible with the HomeKit system in Apple's iPhones and iPads, the company is adding an $80 smart keypad accessory to the mix. Stick it up outside of your home and pair it with the lock using August's app, and you'll be able to get inside by entering a code.

That's a handy addition for anyone who wants to control the lock without using their phone, or for anyone who needs to grant entry to someone who doesn't use a smartphone. Another point of appeal: You can stick the keypad wherever you like, provided it's in Bluetooth range of the lock. That means you could put it someplace subtle and unseen, and use it as an emergency backup for times when you're locked out without your phone on you. (Or, you know, your keys. Remember those?)

Codes can be permanent or one-time-use only, and you'll be able to set limits on when they'll work, too. Like with the original means of sharing access via the app, there's no fee or service charge for adding users into the system.

The keypad itself is slim in profile, and designed to take up as little space as possible. August envisions people using it in conjunction with the new  August Doorbell Cam  -- as such, the two are designed to sit side-by-side on your door frame. We aren't convinced that the doorbell cam will fit particularly narrow door frames on its own, let alone with the keypad sitting beside it, but that's something we'll look into once we get the new gear in for review.

The August Smart Keypad is available for pre-order starting today, and is expected to ship out to US buyers within the next four to eight weeks.

UK and Australia sales aren't open just yet, but August tells us that they're in the works -- that $80 price point converts roughly to just over £50 in the UK, or about AU$110 in Australia. As for the lock itself, the original will now sell for $200 (£130/AU$275), while the new HomeKit-compatible version will cost $230 (£150/AU$315)."
Kodak Video Monitor CFH-V20 review:|"

Kodak isn't new to the world of live-streaming cameras, but its $150 Video Monitor CFH-V20, available in the United States now through Amazon, boasts the most impressive specs in the brand's expanding lineup and is worthy of your consideration for several key reasons.

With live video streaming up to 720p quality, a 180-degree field of view, night vision, motion detection and two-way talk via a built-in speaker and microphone, the V20 presents an intriguing alternative to the $150  ArcSoft Simplicam  as well as to pricier HD models, like the  $200 Flir FX.

Kodak also upgraded its image sensor tech for the V20 (specifically, it has a 3.15-megapixel 1/3-inch sensor -- that's similar to the sensor in  Google's impressive Nest Cam) and made it USB-compatible, so you can attach it to a USB battery pack for a security camera that's designed to travel (wherever there's an obliging Wi-Fi network). While the plastic-bodied camera doesn't feel especially sturdy, it does boast a small footprint and a sleek profile for a pretty discreet addition to any room.

The iSecurity+ app  is supposed to act as your main point of interaction with the camera and its many features, including free 24-hour cloud storage so you can view recorded video clips on the go. It's a very easy app to use, both during the initial setup and afterward when you want to view the live stream, access settings and more. (There's also an iSecurity+ Web app for those more http-inclined.)

And if one day of saved footage isn't enough, you can pay an optional monthly fee -- either $3, $10 or $20 -- for Smart Detection, a premium option that claims to ""eliminate up to 98 percent of false alarms with ART human presence detection"" by being able to tell the difference between people and things. The $30 option just gives you people detection, while the $10 and $20 options also add on longer cloud storage periods of 14 and 30 days.

Given that ArcSoft's Simplicam charges $5 for any sort of cloud services and can't be disconnected from its power adapter, Kodak's portable V20 with free, 24-hour clip storage is especially appealing. The V20 also has its own IFTTT channel (iSecurity+) that makes it possible to add an extra dose of features to its standard offerings. (Read about how the CNET Smart Home uses the IFTTT automation service here.) I created a recipe that sent me a text every time the camera detected activity, and it worked consistently.

That was also true of the camera's broader performance capabilities, with the exception of two-way talk, which was nearly impossible to use due to its poor audio quality. Generally though, the Kodak V20 performed well, sending quick push notifications whenever it detected activity. And, even though free cloud storage is included with the purchase, you can also sign up for a free monthlong Smart Detection trial period (after that you have to pay the requisite $3 per month minimum). With this feature enabled, the camera can suddenly tell you whether or not the activity it detected was a human moving within its wide-angle field of view, or something else, like your cat or a tennis ball.

The V20 did a very good job of distinguishing people from things and you can even adjust the settings so that you only receive alerts when a person is detected. Although I can't confirm whether Kodak's ART human presence detection does actually get rid of exactly 98 percent of false alarms, I didn't receive any during my testing. This makes its people detection functionality a pretty reliable security option, but it has questionable value, especially since it can't scan faces to tell you exactly who you're looking at.

The ArcSoft Simplicam costs the same up front (150 bucks), but that $5 monthly fee includes advanced facial recognition that can tell you whether it's seeing a friend or family member (you can scan up to 10 faces into the system) or a stranger. This worked decently well, but wasn't reliable enough to depend on as a security feature. Netatmo's $200 1080p HD Welcome camera can do something similar via free local storage and it worked better than the hit-or-miss Simplicam.

If you're more interested in learning who is walking in front of your camera at a given time, it might be worth splurging on the Welcome. Additionally, 1080p HD cameras like the Nest Cam,  Piper,  Piper NV,  Netatmo Welcome  and  Samsung SmartCam HD Pro  -- all of which cost roughly $50 more than Kodak's V20 -- are currently the ""gold standard"" for live-streaming resolution. Kodak claims that this camera has the potential to stream in 1080p, but that it's currently limited by its software partner, iSecurity+, to 720p. Still, its 720p quality was fine in both regular and night vision mode.

Even though the V20's Smart Detection feature does a good job of distinguishing people from things, I wouldn't buy this camera strictly for facial recognition. Its IFTTT integration, optional USB-enabled battery pack and wide-angle lens are actually the true stand-outs.

Most 180-degree DIY cameras cost at least $200 if not more and, while IFTTT channels are expanding in the security industry, camera compatibility is still fairly limited compared with other smart home categories. There are even fewer security camera models that have battery-based mobility, even as an optional feature. Still, I expect the V20's poor two-way talk performance and only semi-smart facial recognition feature will be deal breakers for some people.

Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt (Apple HomeKit-enabled) review:|"

We first saw the Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt in January, at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Showcase in Vegas. It was one of a number of products at the show that grabbed headlines by jumping on board with Apple HomeKit, the set of smart home control protocols that have been baked into your iPhone since 2014's update to iOS 8. Now, Schlage Sense is finally set to start selling on November 1st.

As the first HomeKit-compatible door lock (and still the only one, at least for now) Schlage looks to be in a pretty good position. With HomeKit, you can control your smart home gear using Siri commands -- that means that right now, Schlage's got the only deadbolt in town that you can lock and unlock with your voice right out of the box.

At $229, the Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt is priced pretty comparably to what we've seen from competing Bluetooth locks like  	 August  and the  Kwikset Kevo , but note that it costs about 50 dollars more than other smart Schlage locks that communicate using Z-Wave, and that aren't beholden to HomeKit. Those Z-Wave locks work with a number of smart hubs from systems like  SmartThings ,  Wink  and  Staples Connect , all of which allow you to lock and unlock them from beyond your home's Wi-Fi network. With Schlage Sense, your only option for control beyond the home is  Apple TV , which, for the time being, is  the de facto HomeKit hub.

That makes this lock a great fit for Cupertino loyalists with Apple TVs already installed in their living room, or for anyone who's decided that HomeKit is worth buying into on a big scale (Schlage certainly has). If, on the other hand, you aren't so keen on marrying your smart-home setup to HomeKit, you've got a lot of options that make a lot more sense.

With a connected lock, you should expect to be able to lock and unlock your door using a smartphone app. Schlage gets the job done with its Schlage Sense app for iOS devices, though you'll be able to control it in other HomeKit apps, too, including  	 the iDevices app  and  the Insteon+ app .

Smart locks with numeric keypads like the one Schlage Sense uses will also let you assign user-specific codes for different people. With Schlage, you can set parameters for when each code will work, a useful way to let a dog-sitter or a handyman in. I'd like to see Apple work these codes into HomeKit's automation capabilities -- distinct smart gadget triggers tied to specific codes getting entered -- but as of now, the controls don't go that deep.

A bigger limitation is that you can't control the lock from beyond the range of its Bluetooth radio, and especially not from outside the home. At least, you can't unless you've got an Apple TV installed in your home (and installed somewhere that's within Bluetooth range of your front door). If you do, the Apple TV will play the part of your phone while you're out and about, serving as middle man between lock and router.

It's not  	just a middle man, though. Beyond translating the lock's Bluetooth into router-friendly Wi-Fi, the Apple TV serves as a sort of smart home bouncer. When you send a command from outside your network, Apple TV checks its ID before letting it in.

When I tested this arrangement out at the CNET Smart Home, I was able to lock and unlock the door from 40 miles away, albeit with about 9 or 10 seconds of lag. But again, you can't do that if you don't have Apple TV.

What you  	can do is automate your lock alongside other HomeKit gadgets, and integrate it into grouped scenes that trigger several gadgets at once. As an example, a ""bedtime"" scene could turn the downstairs lights off, turn the bedroom ceiling fan on, and lock the front door -- provided you're using HomeKit-compatible gadgets to control everything.

Oh, and Siri. You can control it all using Siri.

Sure she can, so long as you ask nicely. (Actually, not really. I tried telling her to ""lock the damned doors"" at one point, and she didn't miss a beat.)

Jerkitude aside, Siri controls are really the marquee feature with HomeKit, and they're even better with the always-on ""Hey Siri"" functionality  that comes with the newest iPhones. Admittedly, there's something a little bit magical™ about asking your phone to control physical things in your home.

And sure, a lot of it comes down to a convenience-minded laziness angle. I can't count the number of times I've nestled into bed only to realize that I forgot to lock the door -- the idea of asking my phone to take care of it so I can stay tucked in is an appealing one. That said, we'd be remiss not to mention the elderly, the disabled, and anyone else with impaired mobility, for whom voice-activated smart-home gear could be tremendously beneficial.

All of this in mind, I eagerly asked Siri to lock and unlock the front and back door of the CNET Smart Home at least a few hundred times. I came away pleased. Siri never screwed up, telling me she'd locked a door when in reality she hadn't. There were one or two occasions where my commands didn't work, but Siri gave me an error message each time, telling me that for whatever reason, she couldn't access my locks just then. In each case, the same command worked perfectly on the following attempt.

She also did a good job of distinguishing between the two doors. Part of the HomeKit protocols is that you'll give each device a ""Siri Nickname"" when you add it to your setup -- you'll need to refer to the device by that nickname in order for Siri to recognize it. I kept things simple with the locks, going with ""front door"" and ""back door,"" and Siri never got the two confused. I was also able to control both at once by asking her to ""lock the doors,"" (damned or otherwise).

I don't know -- are you good with a screwdriver? If so, then yes, you can probably install this lock yourself. The only potential hiccups would be an irregularly sized door, or one that doesn't sit in alignment (a door where you need to push, pull, or lift as you use the lock to get it to turn smoothly). In those cases, you might want to call a handyman.

In the CNET Smart Home, I was able to install the two locks I tested with relative ease. The included step-by-step instructions were nicely detailed, enough so that I didn't even need to pull up the installation walkthrough video that you'll find in the Schlage app.

The only problem I ran into was with the front door's doorframe: the slot into which the deadbolt extends was shorter than the Schlage specifications by a few millimeters. I proceeded with the install anyway, and fortunately, the lock seemed to work fine when all was said and done. Still, it's the sort of thing you might want to measure before making a purchase. Also keep in mind that the interior half of the lock is pretty bulky -- it'll eat up a good deal of real estate on your door.

With the lock installed, you'll sync with HomeKit by following the instructions in the Schlage app. The app was able to detect both locks in the CNET Smart Home right away -- from there, I just needed to scan in the HomeKit-specific eight-digit code on the front of each lock's manual. It's a cool little HomeKit trick -- the app uses your phone's camera to read the numbers, similar to the way a lot of phones will scan in your credit card info when you're shopping online.

Once you're scanned into the system, you'll be up and running in the app within a few seconds.

It's very good for what it is: a place on your phone where you can add a new lock to your HomeKit setup, tweak its codes and settings, or lock and unlock it with a tap. The design is clean and appealing, and the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. Tapping the home screen's lock will lock or unlock the door, while convenient text at the bottom lets you know what happened the last time the lock was accessed. If you're using multiple deadbolts, you'll swipe left and right to swap between locks.

It isn't a great app for HomeKit-at-large, though, by which I mean it doesn't include controls for other types of gadgets. You can't use it to sync your HomeKit compatible lights with your deadbolt, for instance, nor does it do much of anything to take advantage of HomeKit's built-in scene control capabilities. It's perfectly adequate if locks are all you've got, but once you add more gear to your HomeKit setup, I think you'll almost certainly want to start using a different app for primary control.

Fortunately, you've got some options there. I had no problem discovering and controlling the lock using the iDevices app, for instance. That one sits neck and neck with the Insteon+ app as my HomeKit controller of choice, and both of those products would pair well with Schlage Sense.

Tap the home screen's gear icon, and you'll find various, tweakable settings for the lock. Aside from updating the Siri nickname, you can set it to beep whenever the door is opened, or to ring out in alarm if it detects someone trying to force their way in.

The other icon at the bottom of the home screen looks like a typical icon for contacts, and sure enough, that's what it's there for. Tap it, and you'll be able to program a user-specific code, then send it to that user right from the app. You can also customize a schedule for when that code will work, in case you aren't comfortable sharing 24-7 access with someone. You can also delete a code if needed.

The only features I wish the app included (aside from deeper HomeKit integration) are an option to set an expiration date for a code and a history page showing you a log of when the doors were locked and unlocked. Neither are must-haves, but they both would have made nice additions. (EDITORS' NOTE: Turns out that there is  an event log in the Schlage app -- you access it by tapping the status text that sits beneath the lock on the homescreen.)

The Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt works very well within the HomeKit framework, so if that's the platform you've decided to build your smart home off of, I think that it's a sensible buy at $229 -- especially if you've already got an Apple TV. If you haven't bought in with HomeKit yet, but think you might, I'd recommend waiting a bit to see how things develop. As of today, there are still only a handful of HomeKit-compatible products (less than ten brands as of writing this, per Apple's master list). As more get added -- and as more take advantage of  the new HomeKit features found in iOS 9 -- the platform stands to improve.

All that said, if you're just looking to get your feet wet with smart home gear, then I wouldn't recommend starting with a product that's as fenced-in as this one (same goes for the rest of the HomeKit lineup, for that matter). Other locks -- including  Schlage's own Z-Wave version of the same deadbolt  -- will work with a greater variety of platforms and third-party devices, giving you more room to shop around and experiment with your setup. Unless you're an iOS devotee, that seems like the better approach to me."
iDevices Outdoor Switch review:|"

Editor's note: This review has been updated since it was originally  published to account for a software update that expanded its features,  including adding remote access functionality. The rating and  recommendation have changed accordingly.

The season of untangling orange masses of extension cords and balancing on icy ladder rungs is almost upon us, and you might be wondering if lights are even worth the effort this year. Even in warmer climates, outdoor lighting setups often involve one brave family member climbing to the roof and the rest watching and worrying. And after the setup, people in colder climes have to pull on their boots and a coat, traipse through the snow and manually plug in the lights to turn them on every night.

Enter the new smart Outdoor Switch from iDevices, a HomeKit compatible gadget that the company hopes will make outdoor lighting, whether for the holidays or just for your patio, a little easier. Of course, the Outdoor Switch won't string up your lights for you, but it can schedule or toggle them anytime using the iDevices app, so showing off your handiwork will only take the swipe of a finger.

The iDevices Outdoor Switch, available this November for $80 at select Lowe's locations and on the iDevices website, is a welcome addition to the smart-plug market. The new offering from the company that brought you the iGrill and the Switch will fill the niche of outdoor home electronics that few other smart switches are trying to fill. Many remote switches are already on the market, though, and with Black Friday approaching the question is, why is iDevices asking for 80 bucks? Turns out, between remote access and energy consumption tracking, this Outdoor Switch is worth its price tag.

The good news is you can get this smart plug up and running within minutes. It connects to the free iDevices app, a smart-home device integration app that connects HomeKit compatible products in one place. Although that list of products is not long right now, the app works well with them, subtly guiding you through its interface to various command options, from turning the Switch on and off to scheduling its activation ahead of time.

As we saw with the first iDevices Switch, the app is simple and slick, and within fifteen minutes you'll have a great handle on how to use the Switch to its full potential.

The iDevices Outdoor Switch's design cleverly mixes aesthetic with function. The black outer shell of the Switch's body is weatherproof. Power outlets themselves are nearly impossible to keep completely insulated from the elements, but iDevices includes simple directions for fastening the Switch to the side of your house or an arbor post with an included screw -- an approach that seems to successfully avoid any of the problems common to operating electricity outside.

The Outdoor Switch includes the external nightlight I liked on the original iDevices Switch, and this one creates a similar effect, making what could just be another black plastic utility box by your house glow with more style. I wish you could control the nightlight colors like you can with the indoor iDevices Switch, but most buyers won't sweat it. The Outdoor Switch is too bulky to scream intelligence, but it certainly won't detract from a modern home exterior.

The design element I like the most on the new Outdoor Switch, and likely the explanation for the size and price hike over its indoor equivalent, is the dual outlet. Here iDevices isn't just repackaging an indoor switch for the great outdoors -- it is providing the amperage and dual outlet to power 2,500 incandescent holiday bulbs, let alone more efficient LED bulbs, porch or pool lights. I was a little disappointed that you can't toggle these plugs individually, so plugging in two products for distinct purposes (like floodlights for the yard and LEDs for the porch) doesn't work. iDevices does seem sensitive to the greater needs of outdoor electronics, though, and two plugs will help.

The Outdoor Switch, though certainly not pushing the envelope on features, does rectify some of the early problems of the original app. Of course you can turn your Switch on and off, which is nice when frigid temperatures and 10 feet of snow-covered lawn separate you from the outlet, but now the Switch can also monitor your energy consumption -- a feature that is critical for consumers who love holiday traditions but don't want to break the bank celebrating. You won't get the detailed data organization of the Belkin WeMo Insight Switch, but the information most consumers care about, like daily consumption and estimated costs, are covered.

The iDevices app works well for the most part, and its greatest strength is its organization. As with most HomeKit products, the app allows you to divide your home into rooms, zones (groups of rooms), and products. Then you can tell Siri to control a whole room, like ""the dining room,"" or a whole zone, like ""downstairs."" This method of organization would come in handy if your home were outfitted with dozens of HomeKit devices, but for now this aspect feels like potential for the future more than a feature for the present.

The most practical feature on the Outdoor Switch is the Scenes function. A firmware update means you can now send commands to your Switch even if you are off the home Wi-Fi. For an Outdoor Switch, this is a big feature: it means holiday lights will follow whatever schedule you create, no matter if you're on the property or not.

Any smart outdoor switch needs to perform two functions well to deliver on the claim of being ""smart"": it has to turn things on and off remotely, and it has to work on a schedule. The iDevices Outdoor Switch experienced some latency problems when I used it right after opening the app: once or twice it took my lights a full ten seconds to turn on. Besides this issue, the Switch can power electronics on and off.

Although the Outdoor Switch originally didn't include remote functionality, the problem has now been patched. So even if you're away, your holiday setup will light up -- a big holiday stress-reliever for customers.

Short answer: it depends if you want to spend the money. You can get dumb remote switches for a fourth of the price, and although the Outdoor Switch has quick setup and chic design, those don't justify the price. Now that the firmware update has fixed remote functionality, I'd recommend the Outdoor Switch to anyone who wants to string up their holiday lights, set them on a schedule, and forget about them for two months. You can even adjust the electricity usage to reflect your budget. This sort of experience is only possible with a smart switch like the iDevices Outdoor Switch. You'll just have to decide if it's worth the price."
Yale unveils new Works with Nest smart lock|"

Digital locks are some of the most practical smart-home upgrades out there, but a very legitimate concern is whether they just introduce digital vulnerability to the problem of home security.

This week Yale Locks & Hardware announced three major products for release in 2016 which they hope will not only reassure but also excite potential customers. Two of the newly announced products are locks -- one is Bluetooth-compatible, the other works with Nest Labs' line of smart-home products -- and the third is a security camera that will replace the traditional peephole. Both locks are key-less, but the Works with Nest-branded Linus lock is particularly interesting because of its integration with Nest's Weave technology, a feature that will, according to Yale, improve both security and home integration.

The Linus lock will offer  customizable levels of access to various guests and family, as well as give homeowners the ability to grant or deny access at any time, a layered system of permissions  that mirrors what you'll find in most smart locks, like this Schlage deadbolt. This individualized approach to  security makes the home conveniently accessible to visitors, too,  letting families determine the times when guests, friends or even contractors can access the home.

The Linus lock will also store  data on the comings and goings of up to 250 individual code-users, making such data accessible to other Nest devices and in the Nest app. Linus will transmit this data without using pin codes, though, to preserve data security. Instead it will communicate using what are called ""slot locations"" to identify individuals without compromising their security information.

Although the extent to which Linus's data will affect any given Nest-integrated smart home will depend upon the products surrounding it, Yale seems to be making home integration a focus for this lock. If Nest Protect detects smoke or carbon monoxide,  for example, the new Yale lock will warn family members with voice and  screen alerts before they enter the home. Similarly, the Linus lock  will tell the Nest Learning Thermostat when homeowners enter or leave  the house, helping it adjust home temperature appropriately. These touches are promising, but we'll have to wait till its release to test the depth of Linus's integration.

Every smart lock has to answer questions of how they will be powered, and whether their communication with your other devices (like your smartphone) will take place over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or some other network protocol. The Linus lock will rely upon relatively low-demand  Weave connectivity, so the four AA batteries used to power the lock should last a full year and a half before you need  to replace them. Battery power will keep the lock functional and  secure -- and if the batteries do die, the  lock has a terminal on the bottom to which you can press a  9-volt battery, allowing you to use the touchscreen as normal.

Beyond its energy-consumption implications, Weave's network protocol also means Wi-Fi isn't necessary for Linus's home integration. The lock itself will feature bank-level encryption technology, and the mesh-style Weave network will  allow it to communicate directly with other devices without passing data through a potentially vulnerable Wi-Fi network.

The physical lock will also be secure, benefiting from a reinforced structure; a bolt which Yale says meets and exceeds industry standards; and a new Door Position Sensor that alerts the Nest app to the positions of the bolt and door. And as with many smart locks, it has no keyhole -- a  measure that means no one can pick or bump the lock. The touchscreen technology is like previous Yale locks, but with some yet-undisclosed new features, and the company is confident in its design: it is weather-proof and, according to Yale, ""virtually indestructible.""

Yale is also working to make this smart lock more accessible to a wider audience. For anyone who doesn't own a smart lock, completely replacing your current deadbolt with what basically amounts to a small computer can be intimidating, which is part of the reason retrofit locks like the August Smart Lock have been successful. Yale seems responsive to these apprehensions: The Linus lock will actually guide you through the installation process using voice instructions, something no other major company has done. Assuming this tool works, it will likely help ease the minds of people who, like me, are not naturally handy.

The key-less interface also provides the best of two worlds: you can use a code to enter the door without touching your phone, or you can just as easily grant yourself access through the phone's app. While others, like the Kwikset Kevo, have tried more creative approaches to opening locks (including Yale's own upcoming Bluetooth lock), the Linus seems to find a balance that will maintain both convenience and security.

Yale has not released a target date or price range, but the international company has said the Linus lock  will drop sometime in 2016. For more information on Linus, stay tuned: We'll keep you posted as new  information comes out."
Control locks, bulbs and more with a new extender for Logitech's Harmony Home Hub|"

Logitech's clever crop of universal remote controls already dominates our ""Best of"" list for the category, thanks in part to the  nifty smart-home controls that come into play via the Logitech Harmony Hub . Now, a new $100 accessory for that hub wants to put even more connected home devices under your remote's control.

Called the Logitech Harmony Home Hub Extender, the device is essentially a hub for your hub. Plug it in and stack the old hub on top of it, and you'll be able to add devices that speak Z-Wave and Zigbee to your smart-control setup. That includes a wide array of sensors, switches, door locks and light bulbs.

At first glance, that might not seem like a huge jump for the system. Without the extender, the Harmony Hub could already control  Lifx  and  Philips Hue's color-changing LEDs  and  August Smart Locks  enhanced with the Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi  August Connect  bridge, along with smart thermostats from  Ecobee  and  Nest .

However, there's a wealth of more generic, less expensive smart devices that don't have their own platforms or apps, and instead, rely on third party control platforms like  SmartThings  or  Wink .

Before, you'd need one of those platforms to translate those devices' Z-Wave or Zigbee signals into something your Logitech gear could understand. With the extender, you'll be able to connect with them directly, no third-party middle man platform required.

That brings products like the  Yale Real Living  and  Schlage Camelot  deadbolts into play, as well as low-cost smart bulbs like the  GE Link LED  and the Editors' Choice-winning  Cree Connected LED . Essentially, that makes Logitech Harmony more of a smart home platform in and of itself -- albeit one that's centered around your home's entertainment needs.

It's a fair question as to whether or not existing users will want to buy in on what's basically a second hub for their system, Still, if you've already started automating your home (or if you've been thinking about getting started), the extender might be a legitimate temptation.

Logitech Harmony has proven to be an attractive means of cutting through the chaos of audio/video connections and entertainment peripherals -- if it can do the same for the smart home, it's worth watching.

Available in the US and Canada only, the Logitech Harmony Home Hub Extender is up for sale now at Logitech's website. For a full breakdown of supported devices -- with and without the extender -- click here."
iDevices Switch review:|"

Editors' note, October 27, 2015: This review has been edited to reflect software updates that added energy tracking and remote access. The score and recommendation have been changed in light of these updates.

The Switch is the newest offering from  iDevices, the company that made the polished and handy  	 iGrill , and it's a solid product. The new gadget, arriving online at the iDevices store and select Lowe's locations this month, does what it's supposed to: turn on  whatever is plugged into it with the swipe of a finger or a quick  voice command using Siri. And now, thanks to some major firmware updates, it compares competitively with other smart plugs and switches  on the market (like the  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch , or if you're up for installation,  the  Insteon On/Off Outlet ). Despite this product's iOS exclusivity and problems with user sharing, the iDevices Switch is one of the best you can find for 60 bucks.

You can set up the iDevices Switch within five  minutes. Included in each package is a Quick Start Guide, a fold-out  that directs setup in four easy steps: download the iDevices app,  connect your iPhone or iPad to your home's Wi-Fi, plug the Switch into a  wall, and launch the app. It really is (almost) that simple. Of course,  the Switch requires a few seconds to sync with your device and gain  Wi-Fi access, but within minutes you can tell Siri to turn on your lamp,  and she will.

I did run into a problem while setting up the Switch at the CNET Smart Home, though. It turns out only the original user of a given HomeKit registered home can install new equipment. That means, if one family member sets up one HomeKit device, they must be the one to set up others in the future. I was able to troubleshoot this issue by creating a new home for the Switch, but that meant I couldn't access any of the HomeKit technology my coworker Ry had already set up. While most HomeKit users won't run into this problem, it is a little odd that HomeKit doesn't allow more customizable permissions for user sharing.

Once your new Switch is plugged in and synced to your  home network most of what it does is up to you. The iDevices app offers  an extremely usable interface, letting you easily swipe between rooms,  see multiple Switches or other iDevices products in each room, and toggle  them individually.

Most comparable apps are tied to a physical hub, like  the  	 SmartThings Hub  or  Insteon Hub , but the iDevices Switch and accompanying app  work through  Apple HomeKit. HomeKit is Apple's iOS-based smart home technology that, among other things, lets you control multiple devices from a single app interface. It requires no central hardware hub to link up those products, but to take advantage of it, each connected device you buy has to be HomeKit-compatible. In theory this is a really cool idea, and the iDevices app certainly benefits from the simpler setup, but certain shortcomings inhibit this Switch.

The first  thing I noticed when I opened the app was the simple but elegant  interface. Although I was only working with three products at once (the Switch, the Thermostat, and iDevices' other plug, the Outdoor Switch), it was  clear that the iDevices app is built for efficiency no matter how many  smart-home devices it's integrating.

To state the obvious, the iDevices Switch is exactly that: a switch. It turns things on and off,  manually via a button on the switch, or through your phone. Now it also tracks energy usage and can be set on a schedule to follow even when you're away from home. These offerings are a little spare; the one-year-old Belkin WeMo Insight Switch, for instance, tracks energy consumption in far more depth, and it also integrates with  	 IFTTT  (""if this then that"") to allow for a far deeper level of  personalization. While the iDevices app lets you control your Switches and set  command combinations on timers, the WeMo lets you program  contingencies, like turning off the lights when you leave the house or  turning on the TV when your favorite team is about to take the field. But overall the iDevices Switch offers as much as the common consumer would want.

With the latest firmware updates, you can now also create schedules that run while you're off the property -- a nice touch for those who are security-conscious.

The iDevices Switch  looks nice. It could be smaller, but it rarely presents  problems with outlets -- blocking an adjacent plug on a four-plug outlet,  or not fitting into an outlet set at a corner or under the lip of a  counter. Anyone experienced with smart plugs and switches knows how bulky they can be, but the iDevices Switch is quite compact.

The aesthetic of the  Switch will fit any home already outfitted with Apple products. It's a  glossy white, soft-cornered switch with a linear nightlight that  you can adjust to any color, saturation or brightness. Although the  light isn't bright enough to light up a dark room, the color  personalization is a great touch, and the ability to turn it off is a  simple function that avoids the annoyance of a  	 perpetual LED .

Although the iDevices Switch is visually appealing, the more functional design  decisions stop it from breaking new  ground in the smart-home industry. In terms of size, the Switch  falls between the Belkin WeMo and the iHome SmartPlug, and with only one  plug outlet, the basic design doesn't offer much that would make it stand out.

The iDevices Switch performs well. The response time between the app and  the Switch is quick, so if you toggle a lamp, it'll turn on in less than a  second. Conversely, if you press the button to manually activate the Switch, the app will accurately reflect the setting. Even when you're off your wireless network, the Switch responds quickly to commands.

The two main performance  problems we saw with the iDevices app was difficulty resetting and reinstalling the Switch elsewhere, and inviting  additional users to the same home network. For most users, moving the Switch between multiple houses really won't be an issue, but if the user-sharing problem isn't solved soon, it will  handcuff the already limited capabilities of the iDevices Switch. iDevices is aware of this issue and is working on solutions now. If they solve the problem, the Switch will perform almost flawlessly.

Smart switches are easy way for anyone trying to raise their home's IQ, but the accompanying integration network is as important as the physical technology if you want anything beyond the most basic controls. With HomeKit still maturing, it means you need to have some faith in the Apple ecosystem, and be willing to put up with some bugs, while you wait for that faith to pay off.

The   iDevices app pulls together products in one of the most attractive and   efficient interfaces I've seen, and now the iDevices Switch seems like it would fit right in at a smart home. At $60, (which converts roughly to £40 and AU$85), a user-friendly app and a relatively versatile Switch are the best you can expect.

If you're just looking for an indoor smart switch, the iDevices offering is one of the best out there -- especially for more casual consumers. For HomeKit early adopters, iDevices' product will be a foundational part of your Smart Home's development."
"""Hue, meet Siri"": Philips' color-changing bulbs add Apple HomeKit support"|"

EDITOR'S NOTE: Updated 10/6/2015 with additional information from Philips and Apple.

Over the summer, Philips told us to expect its color-changing Hue connected LEDs  	 to integrate with Siri via Apple HomeKit at some point this fall. Now they're making it official with a new version of the Philips Hue Bridge that's compatible with Apple's iOS-based smart home platform. Simply called the Philips Hue Bridge 2.0, the new control device will work with all existing Hue bulbs and fixtures, letting you bring everything together under HomeKit's fold.

The new bridge will begin selling as part of all Philips Hue starter kits in North America and Europe on October 6th, and -- in a welcome departure for the brand -- will also sell as an individual product for $60 (specifics on international pricing aren't available yet, but that converts to about £40 or AU$85). Existing Hue users will be able to trade their old bridge in for a $20 discount on the new one, bringing the cost of syncing with Siri down to $40. If you don't plan on upgrading, Philips says it'll still support the existing Hue Bridge.

Also new from Hue: improved Hue bulbs, specifically ones that shine brighter than before. The new Hue LEDs have been re-branded ever so slightly as ""Philips Hue White and Color,"" and they promise to put out 800 lumens at peak, white-light brightness. At just 600 lumens, the existing Hue bulbs fell awkwardly in between the brightness you'd expect from a 45-watt bulb and what you'd get with a 60-watt bulb. At 800 lumens, they should now sit comfortably at that familiar 60-watt level.

Another change is that the white-light-only Philips Hue Lux bulbs are being phased out and replaced with the same ""Philips Hue White"" bulbs that we saw with the  	 Philips Hue Wireless Dimming Kit . I liked the Lux bulbs a lot, but I'm fine with the change, as the Hue White bulbs left me equally impressed when I tested them out. Plus, they're cheaper than before, costing just $15 each in the US -- the same low price as Hue Bridge-compatible third-party smart bulbs like the  GE Link  and  Cree Connected LEDs . Generic Zigbee bulbs like those will continue to work with the new Hue Bridge -- but they won'twork with HomeKit.

That's the same Hue-exclusive approach Philips took with the recent Amazon Echo integration. With the new Hue White bulbs costing the same as the Cree and GE bulbs, it looks to be a pretty pure play at trumping the competition, though not one that's terribly friendly to Hue users who've already invested in a whole home's worth of off-brand lights. It's a move that will likely get a lot of new users to stick with Hue bulbs only as they build out their setups, but existing users might feel a bit burned.

With Hue bulbs under HomeKit's control, you'll be able to trigger lighting changes with voice commands using your iOS device. Siri can turn your lights on and off or dim them to a specific percentage, and she can change the color of your bulbs, too.

While Hue LEDs claim to be capable of producing millions of shades, Philips tells me that the current number of colors that Siri can understand is ""less than ten."" So, in lieu of ""vermilion,"" you'll need to stick with plain old ""red."" That might soon change, though, as a source at Apple tells me that upcoming tweaks to Siri's vocabulary will include support for ""more than 800 colors."" Whether or not vermilion makes the cut remains to be seen.

That said, you'll also be able to use Siri to launch any scenes you've created in the Hue app, which brings more specific color control into play. To do so, you'll need to access ""Siri Voice Control"" in the Hue app's settings. From there, you'll be able to tell Hue which scenes you want Siri to control. Hue will then translate them into scenes that follow HomeKit's coding so Siri can work with them. The Hue team describes this as a big part of HomeKit's appeal, claiming that Siri is as strong a tool for launching scene changes as the Hue app is for crafting them. I'm inclined to agree.

Of course, Siri isn't the only voice control platform that can control Hue LEDs. The bulbs  	 already work with the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and more specifically with ""Alexa,"" the  cloud-connected, voice-activated artificial assistant housed within . However, Alexa can only turn Hue lights on or off, or dim them -- the engineers at Philips tell me they're still working with Amazon on programming spoken commands for color changes and scene launches. It's a battle worth paying attention to as Siri and Alexa duke it out to serve as the smart home's voice of choice.

It's also worth noting that the new Hue Bridge isn't a HomeKit-specific product, but rather a bridge that includes HomeKit support as one of a growing number of options for smart home control. Philips wants to stay future-proof and platform-agnostic as the connected home continues to develop, which means that you'll still be able to integrate your Hue bulbs with non-HomeKit controllers including  	 SmartThings ,  Staples Connect , and  IFTTT.  Hue's team also tells me that they plan on adding support for  Google's Weave connected home protocol through a firmware upgrade down the line. That's a distinctly different approach than the other HomeKit-compatible gadgets we've seen thus far, all of which put most (if not all) of their eggs into Apple's basket.

Those gadgets include the  	 Insteon Hub Pro , the  iDevices Switch , and the  Elgato Eve Room  temperature and humidity sensor. With the new Hue Bridge, you'll be able to control your bulbs alongside all of them within iOS. You could link your bulbs with a HomeKit-compatible door lock like the  Schlage Sense Deadbolt , then group everything so that your lights turn off and your door locks with a single Siri command.

You'll also be able to control Hue bulbs in other HomeKit-compatible apps, and add pre-programmed color changes to your HomeKit-specific scenes. For instance, you'll already find a smart bulb color selector in the Insteon+ HomeKit app -- you could use it to create a ""Workout"" scene that flips a fan on and turns the lights bright blue whenever you tell Siri to run it. Third-party HomeKit control apps that aren't tied to a specific product are already starting to pop up, too. Expect coverage and reviews of all of it as HomeKit continues to mature."
Angee promises to look and listen attentively to keep your home safe|"

A security camera with a goal of whole home monitoring, Angee can rotate its head 360 degrees and watch you as you move throughout a room. That might sound creepy, but like the  Netatmo Welcome , Angee is designed to get to know you and your family. Once it learns who's who, the spec sheet says it'll carefully track unknown individuals, but can be told to leave you and your family alone and can even turn to face the wall when you're around.

Complete with Bluetooth door sensors that talk directly to the main camera, Angee aims to keep track of who comes and goes both on your phone via Bluetooth and through voice recognition software built into the camera. If you take your phone beyond the range of the geofence around the sensors, the system will arm. Bring the phone back into range, and it'll disarm. If your phone's dead, you can simply speak a password to lower Angee's guard.

With the system armed, you'll receive an alert if the camera detects motion. You can use the iOS or Android app to see the clip surrounding the trigger, or pull up a live feed.

Designed by electronics startup Angee, Inc, you can preorder Angee now via the company's Kickstarter campaign for the product. At retail, Angee will cost you $430 for the camera and one sensor. A few deals with first come, first serve preorder discounts are still available if you're so inclined. It'll ship anywhere in the world. The price converts to around £283 and AU$612 for our readers in the UK and Australia.

$430 is by no means cheap, given that other capable competitors such as  Nest Cam ,  Piper , and the Netatmo Welcome cost as little as $200. Angee gets points for offering both local and cloud storage of clips for no subscription fee. It'll only record suspicious activity, and it'll fine tune what it finds suspicious over time as it learns your family's behavior. It's also scalable, as multiple cameras and sensors can talk to the same system and communicate with each other about who's home and who isn't.

If you need to scale it, the price will obviously increase further. Angee will talk directly to your router, but the compatible sensors need to be in Bluetooth range of the camera to be effective. So if you have a home bigger than an apartment, you'll probably need to pay for multiple cameras if you want to make full use of the system's ability to monitor all entry points.

Angee tries to stand out by not only packing in voice recognition, but the ability to understand voice commands. Supposedly functioning similarly to the Amazon Echo, Angee will be able to search the Web, remind you of your calendar events, and tell you when members of your family arrived or left. All you have to do is ask. The idea of the Echo's capabilities packed into a rotating security cam is quite appealing to me. And since Angee will arm and disarm itself autonomously, it checks the right boxes in terms of doing enough to look competent and cool, but not so much that it doesn't sound feasible.

That's not to say that I don't have concerns about Angee. Will it lose track of who's home if a person's phone is off and he or she isn't in the same room as the camera? How can it effectively track your kids if they don't have a phone? Perhaps most importantly, how good will it be at voice recognition?

So far, we've seen two cameras with facial recognition, and that's a stretch goal of Angee if it earns enough funds from Kickstarter. Neither of the two existing cameras employed face recognition tech seamlessly, though the Netatmo Welcome came closer than the  ArcSoft Simplicam . I'll be curious to find out if voice recognition is easier to implement than facial recognition.

The daily calendar software is also a stretch goal for Angee, and without it, the voice control and reminder options begin to look bare bones, especially compared to the Amazon Echo. The Echo can interact directly with your phone,  communicate with other smart home devices, and play music from your library. We've also seen a few  voice control hubs fall on their face  in terms of their ability to actually understand what you're saying and respond with useful information.

Between the promise of whole home security, voice recognition and voice commands, geofencing, and motion sensing rotation, Angee has a lot of potential as a central smart home device, but it's also set up quite a few potential pitfalls. It needs to avoid most, if not all of those, to prove worth its $430 price and beat out the steep competition in the connected cam market."
Oasys wants to track your home water usage|"

Have you ever wondered how much water you use on a regular basis and how your consumption compares to your neighbors? Barcelona-based startup Oasys just launched a Kickstarter campaign for a water-tracking product of the same name, designed to give you all of these details and more.

Here's how it's supposed to work: Go straight to the source -- your home's water main (which might be trickier if you live in an apartment or a condo) -- and wrap Oasys' wireless sensor around it. With that sensor in place, Oasys should be able to track all of the water that's going into your home.

The other hardware component is a rounded Wi-Fi-enabled wall-mounted device that goes in your home and looks a lot like the  Honeywell Lyric Thermostat . It compiles all of the information from the sensor, along with the local forecast and watershed levels and sends you reports of your weekly water usage, including how it compares to previous weeks  and also to similar homes. And, if you have room for improvement, Oasys is supposed to help you set goals for the future.

It sounds simple enough, but this device was actually developed to help people living in areas susceptible to draughts, such as California, to better manage their consumption. The team further hopes that Oasys will inspire everyone to improve their water-saving ways.

Rather than relying on audio alerts, the wall-mounted Oasys device is equipped with LEDs that will change color to alert you to a potential problem. For instance, if the sensor detects abnormally high usage, Oasys will turn red, alerting you to a possible water leak. And if you aren't home at the time, you're still supposed to be able to receive a text or an email on your smartphone, although Oasys won't have any mobile apps at launch, only a web-based portal.

This isn't the first water-tracking device we've ever seen of course, but smart DIY versions are a relatively new product category. Belkin is supposed to bring its water- and energy-tracking  Echo technology  to market by the end of 2015. But, it comes with individual sensors rather than a single one that attaches to your water main. That makes Oasys' solution seem particularly appealing from a setup standpoint.

The Oasys Kickstarter campaign just launched with a €50,000 goal (that's about $55,000, £35,000 or AU$78,000 at the current exchange rate). You'll need to contribute at least €180 ($200, £130 or AU$280) to get an Oasys of your own and units are expected to ship to backers worldwide on May 16, 2016."
SmartThings Hub (Second Generation) review:|"

Editor's Note (May 2, 2016): Due to ongoing issues with performance and reliability, we are suspending our recommendation for the SmartThings Hub 2.0. Read this post for more details.

The smart home market is a crowded space. There are so many brands showcasing their DIY ""product of the day"" that it's hard to keep track of what's what. That's where products like Samsung's $99/£100 (converting to about AU$140) second-generation SmartThings Hub come into play.

This Z-Wave- and ZigBee-enabled gizmo connects to your Wi-Fi router and it, along with the SmartThings' related Android, iOS or Windows app, act as filters for all of the connected stuff in your house. The goal is to eliminate, or at least reduce the need to switch between multiple apps or plug tons of different single-protocol hubs into your router.

It doesn't hurt that SmartThings integrates with a particularly impressive number of products both directly and indirectly, through its IFTTT channel and its developer community. And its performance speaks for itself, it works very well. Unfortunately, its app interface (I used the iOS version) is confusing and adds frustration to a system specifically designed to simplify your smart home setup. It also has a built-in Bluetooth radio, but SmartThings hasn't activated it yet (SmartThings has plans for various updates in the coming months, though, so we'll be sure to update this review accordingly).

While the second-gen SmartThings isn't perfect today, it still outperforms hub equivalents from Wink, Lowe's Iris, Staples Connect, and the HomeKit-enabled Insteon. I can comfortably recommend it to anyone interested in diving head-first into the wide world of third-party smart home integrations.

I get it. Smart home hubs need to blend in with all sorts of different design aesthetics to avoid alienating potential buyers. But, I am pretty tired of the bland plastic cube-hub look.

I can't blame SmartThings entirely for my frustration, because it's the default for a ton of brands (with the exception of the now-defunct Revolv hub, which was bright red, teardrop-shaped and delightfully different). But, SmartThings definitely didn't take any innovative design detours with its second-gen hub.

Still there's a ton of useful tech tucked inside the thing, so as long as I can shove it in a cabinet next to my router, I guess its utilitarian-ness doesn't offend all that much.

Speaking of useful tech, Samsung's SmartThings brand added a Bluetooth radio to its existing ZigBee and Z-Wave protocol lineup and introduced new integrations with various Belkin WeMo products, Amazon Echo and more. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth radio isn't active yet. SmartThings' CEO Alex Hawkinson told me that it should be active within the next six months or so, and that the team is waiting for protocol improvements including mesh networking designed to extend the existing Bluetooth range.

SmartThings also boasts a very active developer community, where anyone with the programming chops can tackle integrations between the hub and third-party stuff that isn't yet an official brand partner. A quick look at the website shows that individuals are regularly sharing details on ongoing projects as well as discussing new and innovative ways to integrate various devices with SmartThings. That level of inclusivity is pretty unique in this industry, and helps to boost SmartThings' overall appeal.

Factor all of the ZigBee-enabled SmartThings sensors (I connected a proximity ""Arrival"" sensor, a door/window ""Multipurpose"" sensor, a Motion sensor, a Water Leak sensor and a smart Outlet to the hub), both officially and unofficially-supported third party devices and its IFTTT channel into the equation and SmartThings has the lock on sheer number of potential product integrations and rule customizations.

Also new to the SmartThings Hub: battery backup with four included AA batteries and local storage of select home automations. The idea here is that certain triggers should still work even if you lose your Wi-Fi connection or your power altogether. This backup feature will only work for products that SmartThings specifically marks to work locally. Right now, it only  supports smart lighting integrations, but SmartThings says it will be expanding support to its entire Smart Home Monitor section of the app in the future (that's where you can arm and disarm your system and create custom security-based alert rules).

For instance, your siren should go off if a door/window sensor or motion sensor detects activity (even if the hub is offline due to spotty Wi-Fi or a power outage). Of course, you won't receive any alerts on your phone (except for an initial warning that your SmartThings Hub went offline), but it's still nice to know that you'll have backup when you need it. SmartThings also has plans to add bundled kits to its product lineup in early October.

Samsung's SmartThings can do a lot, but the companion Android, iOS and Windows app is the single point of access between you and your system -- and that's a problem. I wish I could say that setup and overall app usability was seamless, but it was full of complications. This is mainly because the software is darn-near impossible to navigate in any intuitive way.

From setting up the hub to configuring the last SmartThings sensor, and even adding  third-party devices like Philips' Hue LEDs into the mix, I was shocked by how hard it was to find whatever setting or configuration I was looking for.

And even when I did manage to find it, I still regularly struggled to understand the steps I needed to take to make the changes I had originally wanted. On more than one occasion I gave up, frustrated, only to return to it later to try again.

Given that most systems provide step-by-step tutorials that walk you through the installation, initial configuration and more advanced customizations, I'd have to say that the SmartThings app is among the most confusing I've ever encountered.  That's partly because it can do so much -- you can add SmartThings sensors, third-party devices, in-app rules and, new for this version, even organize your various products by room -- but finding what you want and actually managing to configure it correctly was a true challenge.

Not convinced by my impassioned rant? See for yourself. Take a look at the screenshot of the app homepage to the right and try to make sense of it.

Remember those bundled kits I mentioned briefly earlier, though? According to SmartThings, they are supposed to walk you through the app configuration process from start to finish. That wouldn't help anyone who bought the SmartThings Hub as a standalone device, but it might make it easier for some folks to interact with the app. We'll be sure to update this review when we get our hands on a kit.

Moving beyond my distaste for the odd app layout, SmartThings' performance was great.

I could view at-a-glance status updates of the various sensors and devices I had set up around the house and received prompt, reliable messages that alerted me to motion, an open or closed door, water leaks and more.

I was also able to arm and disarm the system via a section of the app called Smart Home Monitor and even customize within the ""armed"" state. That way if I was home, but wanted to arm the system, it would alert me if the front door opened (via SmartThings' ZigBee-enabled door/window sensor), but not if I triggered the motion sensor that was set up in the living room.

Alternatively, if I wanted to arm the system while I was away, it would alert me if either the front door opened or if the motion sensor inside the house was triggered. And I set up a rule so that the lamp connected to the SmartThings outlet (outfitted with a Philips Hue LED), as well as two other Philips Hue LEDs connected to ceiling pendant lamps, would turn red if the system was armed and either the front door opened or the motion sensor detected activity.

I connected a Samsung SmartCam HD Pro to SmartThings, too, and set it to record a minute-long clip if a motion event took place while the system was armed.

All of this performed flawlessly, but you still need the Philips Hue Bridge to pair Hue LEDs to SmartThings, so you're really only enjoying the benefit of accessing the LEDs from the SmartThings app, rather than saving money by avoiding a separate hub. And, the live stream of the Samsung's SmartCam HD Pro isn't as good as the native app. Still, all of the integrations worked very well.

Unfortunately, though, free access to saved video clips within SmartThings' Smart Home Monitor will end in 2015. Starting in January, you'll have to pay a $5 monthly fee for this feature, although you'll always be able to view your live stream for free. I get that you're enjoying advanced customizations via the SmartThings app, but I'm not sure the video clip fee is worth it since the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro comes with a microSD card slot for fee-free storage as well as letting SmartCam HD Pro users review saved footage on the related Web and mobile apps.

I also carried various sensors to the far corners of the CNET Smart Home to get a sense of their range, but they never failed to deliver reliable results (And remember that this house is big -- 5,800 square feet big).

The $50 Wink Hub is cheaper than SmartThings, but its performance was pretty glitchy. And, while the Staples Connect Hub worked fine, its app couldn't handle all of the features from the third-party devices connected to it. Lowe's Iris is compatible with a lot of devices, but it charges $10 per month for its functionality -- not exactly expensive, but SmartThings, Wink and other competitors are fee-free (minus the optional $5 monthly fee coming to SmartThings' Smart Home Monitor in 2016). The  HomeKit-compatible Insteon Hub  is another intriguing option that has potential, but Apple's Siri-based platform isn't robust enough to make it worthwhile (not yet, at least).

Right now, Samsung's $99/£100 SmartThings Hub 2.0 offers the widest variety of potential product integrations and features with performance that is downright impressive. Still, this smart home hub is far from perfect. Specifically, its companion app is cluttered and tough to navigate -- a pretty significant negative given that it's your main point of interaction with SmartThings. Activating its Bluetooth protocol will also add a lot of fresh options to the hub's expanding list of product partnerships.

A lot is changing in the larger smart home market that could put SmartThings' dominance in jeopardy, too. With iOS 9 updates and  Insteon's HomeKit-compatible hub , we might start to see some broader automation applications from Apple's sluggish smart home platform. Google is also trying to stake a claim in the Internet of Things (IoT) beyond its Nest brand. The tech giant announced an Android-based smart home operating system called Brillo in May that has all sorts of potential to challenge the current IoT landscape.

Overall I'd recommend SmartThings to anyone interested in building a multiproduct smart home at this moment, but things are changing fast. What works best today might be different a few months from now.

Insteon Hub Pro (HomeKit-enabled) review:|"

Slowly but surely, Apple's been building a foundation for connected-home devices directly into its iOS mobile operating system. It's called HomeKit, and its goal is to standardize the smart home so that all of your gadgets work seamlessly with your phone, with Siri and with each other.

Launched this summer, the Insteon Hub Pro was one of the first HomeKit-compatible devices to hit the market. Essentially, it's the same thing as  Insteon's existing smart-home hub , which acts as a centralized brain for Insteon's wide range of connected home devices. Plug it into your router, and the Insteon Hub will translate those gadgets' proprietary Insteon signals into something your home network -- and thus, your smartphone -- can understand.

The Insteon Hub Pro adds in HomeKit support and tacks an extra 50 bucks onto the price, bringing it up to $150 (not yet available in the UK or Australia, it's about £99, AU$210, converted roughly). With HomeKit in the picture, you'll be able to put those Insteon devices under Siri's control, or control them alongside other HomeKit-compatible devices from different manufacturers. That makes the Insteon Hub Pro a pretty clear candidate to anchor HomeKit-oriented smart homes.

There are tradeoffs though -- most notably that the Hub Pro doesn't currently support the full catalogue of Insteon devices. It can bring Insteon's connected light bulbs, switches, and dimmers into the HomeKit fold, but key devices for keeping an eye on the home -- cameras, motion sensors, leak detectors, etc. -- aren't compatible yet. The arrival of iOS 9  brings new HomeKit support for these types of devices, but as of now, the Hub Pro still can't put them to work, nor does it take advantage of HomeKit's new iCloud remote access in iOS 9, which eliminates the need for an Apple TV to access your devices when you're not at home. That all might change with a simple firmware update, but I wouldn't recommend buying in until it does.

Insteon is a California based start-up that's been in business for a few decades now, so its platform is fairly well developed. Its devices communicate with one another using Insteon's proprietary dual-mesh signal, which combines a wireless radio frequency with your home's existing electrical wiring. The idea is that the second transmission layer serves as a backup in case of wireless interference in the first, making for a more reliable connection.

As for the ""mesh"" part, when a signal gets sent out over Insteon's network -- the hub telling a light bulb to turn on at sunset, for instance -- the signal gets transmitted through every device in the system, all of them acting as a sort of repeater for the network. That gives the system a scalability boost -- the more devices you add, the more robust the network becomes.

All of that applies to the Insteon Hub Pro, with the added benefit of HomeKit compatibility. Basically, what the Hub Pro does is add in specific security-minded hardware to comply with Apple's standards, and also software tweaks that help it manage devices in a way that fits in with HomeKit's bigger scheme. That brings Siri into play -- ask her to turn off a light bulb that's connected to the Insteon Hub Pro, and she'll get right on it. You can also use the the Hub Pro (and its corresponding Insteon+ iPhone app) to add and control other HomeKit-compatible devices side-by-side with your Insteon gear. And yes, as a HomeKit device, we're talking iOS control only. Sorry, Android users.

As for the hardware itself, the Hub Pro is simply a boxy rectangle of white plastic -- same as  the old Insteon Hub . It's a minimalist design that you'll likely plug into your router and forget about, though the shiny, white plastic aesthetic extends to much of Insteon's more visible gadgets, as well -- most notably its lamp dimming and appliance on/off plugs (sold separately). Similar to  Belkin WeMo Switches , the Insteon plugs are simple enough to use, but I don't like that the sockets are located on the bottom of each device -- that makes it tough to plug and unplug your lamps or appliances if the socket is in an inconvenient spot. For basic on/off management, I might be inclined to go with another HomeKit-compatible switch, like the  iHome Smart Plug  or the  iDevices Switch , instead.

There are some key limitations to keep in mind before you buy in with the Hub Pro. Apple's been a bit slow to extend HomeKit support to things like motion sensors and leak detectors, and though  support is finally ready with iOS 9, Insteon hasn't updated its firmware to take advantage of it yet. That means that, at least for the time being, you won't be able to connect any of Insteon's sensors with the Hub Pro.

Unless Insteon finds a way to update the system or add new HomeKit-compatible hardware, you're limited to Insteon's switches, light bulbs, dimmers and other devices you turn on and turn off. That's probably a deal-breaker if you've already got a lot of other Insteon gear up and running in your home -- in that case, you should almost certainly stick with the existing Insteon Hub. Still, I would expect that we'll start seeing HomeKit-compatible sensor hardware from other manufacturers before the end of the year, and when those devices arrive, you should be able to add them under the Hub Pro's control.

Another limitation, at least in the short term, is that you can't access any of the Hub Pro's devices from beyond your home network unless you have an Apple TV in your home to act as a gatekeeper. That's one of HomeKit's original security features, and while iOS 9 lifts the restriction by moving the iCloud Keychain into that gatekeeper role, again, Insteon hasn't updated the firmware to take advantage yet.

I've reached out to Insteon to try and get a timetable for any potential updates, but haven't heard back yet. Watch this space -- I'll let you know when I hear more or if any notable updates arrive.

To put the Insteon Hub Pro through its paces, I installed it at the CNET Smart Home here in Louisville, Kentucky. Though the hub itself sells for $150, you can also purchase a starter kit with a few extra Insteon devices included. For my purposes, I tested out a kit with a brand new Insteon LED, Insteon Lamp Dimmer and an Insteon On/Off Switch. I also dug through our storage closet and found the  Insteon LED  and Insteon Lamp Dimmer I tested two years ago when I reviewed  an older model of the Insteon Hub  -- I wanted to see if I'd be able to use them with the new system, too.

It turned out that I could, though adding devices to my setup was a bit of a wonky experience. The app detected my freshly plugged-in Hub Pro with ease, and after entering the HomeKit-specific code printed on its underside, I was up and running. But when I tried to add my devices to the setup, the sweeping radar animation would often spin and spin and spin before finally giving me an error message. After tapping back in the main menu, I'd discover that my device had, in fact, been added to my setup. So, a glitchy process, but at least a successful one.

Once you've managed to add your devices into the app, you'll be able to control and customize them. Those customizations include the name you'll use for Siri purposes, along with an icon. Insteon gives you oodles of options here, which makes it easy to tailor the app to your home's specific style. Some of those icons animate when you use them -- a desk fan that spins when you turn it on, for instance. It's a little thing, but I liked it.

I also liked that Insteon-controlled lights remember their dimming level after you turn them off -- turn them back on again, and they'll return to that level. You can see that pre-dimmed level in the app by looking at the on/off status button for the device. When it's greyed out in the off position, you'll still see a green ring around it -- a complete ring indicates a pre-dimmed level of 100 percent, while a half circle indicates 50 percent, and so on. It's a nice, subtle touch.

As of now, the Insteon+ app lets you set up schedules for when your devices turn on and off, and moving forward, it's likely to take advantage of HomeKit's new rule-creation capabilities that let you tie a device to your phone's location or to another HomeKit-compatible device, like a motion sensor. But, again, that's an iOS 9-specific upgrade, and Insteon hasn't updated the app to take advantage of it yet (detecting a pattern here?)

The star of the show is Siri, though. Tell her to turn a specific device on or off, and she'll take care of it. You can also group multiple devices by room, then tell Siri to control all of the devices in that room with a single command. You can also create ""zones"" (the entire downstairs of your home, for instance), or create ""scenes"" with saved device settings for things like movie night or party lighting.

Those Siri controls weren't perfect, though. Aside from the usual voice control misfires (""Brighton the bedroom lamp,"" ""Did the kitchen light to ten percent""), I encountered a few instances where my Siri command wouldn't accomplish anything. In some cases, Siri would think she had turned something on when in reality nothing had happened, and in others, she'd simply tell me that she couldn't see any devices at the moment. In one case, a lamp seemed to freeze on me -- I couldn't turn it off with Siri or through the app, either. It wasn't until I physically turned the lamp off and back on again that I was once more able to control it remotely.

All in all, these fails amounted to about 5 percent of my experience. In the other 95 percent of my tests, things worked as expected, with Siri turning things on and off without delay. She'll also dim your lights to a specific percentage, which I found useful, though you can't tell her to turn something on or off at a certain time or after a certain amount of time, even with the iOS 9 updates. For that type of scheduling, you'll still need to dig through the app.

I also made sure to spread my devices out through the 5,800 sq. ft. CNET Smart Home in order to test the range out. The toughest challenge for the system was a lamp dimmer that I placed in the upstairs master bedroom -- as close to the opposite corner of the house from the hub as I could get. Even with the distance, remote control and scheduled automations worked as well as everything else -- a solid affirmation of Insteon's mesh approach.

The Insteon Hub Pro shows a lot of potential. Though there isn't much competition yet, it seems to be the best choice to serve as a HomeKit control hub capable of managing a wide variety of Apple-friendly smart-home gadgets. The problem is that most of those HomeKit-compatible gadgets aren't here yet. On top of that, Insteon hasn't yet taken advantage of  the latest HomeKit upgrades -- remote access, sensor support, and automation triggers. All three of those are smart-home essentials.

For those reasons, I'm holding off on recommending the Hub Pro. It's simply too limited an experience in it's current state when compared to more well-developed systems like  SmartThings ,  Staples Connect , and even  plain, vanilla Insteon  -- all of which cost less than the Hub Pro's $150 asking price. It also wasn't as flawless a performer as I'd liked to have seen, especially given Insteon's reputation for reliability. As HomeKit improves, so too should the Hub Pro, but until it does, I say wait and see."
Cree 4Flow LED (2015) review:|"

Cheaper isn't necessarily better. That's Cree's message in a year where LED prices are plummeting, and where new arrivals from  Philips  and  GE  can be had for less than $5 each -- an eyebrow-raising comparison to  the $8 Cree 4Flow LED , which sits right next to them on Home Depot shelves. You get what you pay for, Cree warns -- those cheaper competitors aren't dimmable, and they don't last nearly as long as the 4Flow LED, either.

It's a solid argument, and one that's helped Cree carve out a reasonable middle-ground price point that, for many bulb-buyers, is likely worth the extra couple of bucks. Now, less than a year after the 4Flow's debut, Cree's seeking to strengthen its claim by refining the 4Flow's hardware and replacing it with a new-and-improved model that'll sell for the same $8.

Among the improvements are small steps forward in the bulb's efficiency, its lifespan, and in the warranty, which Cree is raising from three years to five. Unfortunately, there are some disappointing steps backward, too. Despite having the same lumen listing as before, the new 4Flow came in a few percentage points dimmer than the original. It also isn't nearly as good on certain dimmer switches, with a constant flicker at minimum settings that we didn't experience the last time around. The new 4Flow LED is still a decent bulb, but it's not as flawless as before, and not as easy to recommend over those cheaper competitors.

The new 4Flow LED looks exactly like the original -- the only way to tell the two apart is to read the fine print on the base of the bulb. There, you'll see that the original is listed at 11 watts. The new 4Flow rings in at 9.8 watts, yet claims to put out the same amount of light (815 lumens), making it the slightly more efficient option.

I really can't fault Cree for leaving the design as-is -- it's a good-looking bulb that perfectly mimics the shape and silhouette of an incandescent. Turn it on, and it's difficult to tell that it isn't an incandescent.

The trick is in the heat sinks -- or rather, the lack of them. The Cree 4Flow manages heat with convection vents in the top and bottom of the bulb, instead. No matter which direction the bulb is oriented, there's always an opening above and below the heat-producing hardware at its core. Thanks to thermodynamics, the hotter air vents out while cooler air vents in -- hence ""4Flow,"" and hence the reason why this bulb doesn't need bulky heat sinks bogging it down.

Like  the original 4Flow LED , the new version puts it light out at a yellowy color temperature of 2,700 K, or a whitish 5,000 K if you're willing to spend an extra buck. Cree claims that they've improved the bulb's color rendering score, which measures how accurately it illuminates different tones. The original scored a very average 80 out of 100 -- the new one comes in at 83. It's a pretty minuscule bump -- you really need to get up over 85 before you'll start noticing colors that look any more vivid.

The other improvements are even more unseen: a longer lifespan and a longer warranty to go with it. The original 4Flow promised to last 25,000 hours -- 22.7 years, if you use the light for three hours a day on average, with the first three of those years covered by the warranty. The new model bumps that up to 30,000 hours, or just over 27 years, with a five-year warranty. I'm not sure that anybody felt that 25,000 hours just wasn't enough, but it's certainly a good slap in the face to the less expensive  Philips 60W Replacement  and  GE Bright Stik  LEDs, which claim lifespans of 11,000 and 15,000 hours, respectively.

Cree's 4Flow LED is compatible with most dimmer switches -- a key leg up over the non-dimmable Philips and GE LEDs. Cree claims that the new version is compatible with even more switches, and that it won't buzz when you dim it, either. Sure enough, I didn't hear any buzz as I dialed it down (same as with the original), but I did notice a fair amount of flicker at low settings, which was new. To keep things fair, I dug the original bulb out of storage and re-tested it -- it still dimmed like a champ, with little to no flicker whatsoever. On the exact same switch at the exact same setting, the new version flickered badly.

In fairness, the flicker only occurred with one out of three of the dimmer switches on our rig, an admittedly small sample size. Still, it's a very common model: a Leviton switch designed for use with LED bulbs, and one that sells just steps away from the Cree section at Home Depot. Your mileage may vary based on what switch you're using (and on other factors, like voltage irregularities), but for what it's worth, the old 4Flow aced our dimming test while the new one did not.

Something else I noticed: the new 4Flow didn't test quite as bright as the old one. Both are listed at 815 lumens, but while the old model came in high at 835, the new model came in low at 777. It's a relatively small difference, and not one that you're likely to notice with the naked eye (I couldn't), but if you're a stickler for brightness, you'll want to take note. Just keep in mind that both numbers sit within our integrating sphere's 5% margin of error, if only just barely.

Is this a better 4Flow LED? That's a tougher question than it ought to be. On paper, the answer is yes. It's more efficient, with approximately the same light output as before from a lower power draw, and it boasts a better color rendering score, too. On the other hand, it didn't fare as well in our dimming tests, and it didn't register quite as much brightness as before, either.

Both of these qualms -- a new flicker on one dimmer switch and a lower lumen output -- are pretty nit-picky, and neither one is enough for me to call the new bulb a categorical step back from the first. The longer lifespan is a welcome, though perhaps unnecessary, improvement, and the longer warranty will appeal to many, as well. But superior light quality is Cree's eight-dollar claim here, and flawless dimmability was the original 4Flow's trump card against its cheaper competitors. The new model can't play that card as effectively as before. This is still a decent light bulb with a clever design, but it's not the clear slam dunk that we've seen from Cree bulbs in the past."
Crowd willing, an elegant wireless charging sidetable|"

BERLIN -- If nothing else, London-based Fonesalesman knows how to make a great-looking prototype. (It knows how to make  	wireless charging coasters and battery packs, too). Its wireless charging side table, under the moniker FurniQi, is all clean cuts and smooth surfaces thanks to the fact that it's made of bamboo. Plunk down any device that supports Qi wireless charging onto the two subtly ringed zones on the top of the FurniQi table and watch your power meter rise.

Look close at the FurniQi table and you'll see a pretty simple design. Two round charging pucks fitted into the bottom of the table transmit power.  The charging area is denoted on top by two subtle circles in the surface. The company said it made them thin to minimize the design impact (and to keep the circles from looking like coffee stains). It also made the cuts shallow to minimize dust and grime collection.

For its own power source, the table does have a power cable. It's a standard USB cable running to each puck, and the wire is roughly the same color as the wood. You can bind it to one of the legs with an included set of clips for neater cable routing. You also have to assemble the table yourself, and the legs attach with Allen screws.

I should note that during a demo of the table, the responsiveness of the charging puck was flaky when the company rep tried charging multiple different phones. He said the table had a new (two days new, to be exact), different charging puck in it than the one in their existing charging products and that could be the culprit.

The reason for the different puck is that it has a mute feature that lets you turn off an audio notification that tells you when it's making a charge. He bravely soldiered on with us until he could get the demo working, and was up front about acknowledging the delayed response. Hopefully a solution will materialize quickly.

Fonesalesman won't be alone in the wireless-charging furniture market if the Indiegogo campaign for FurniQi succeeds. Another small furniture company named  	 IKEA is bringing Qi-equipped furniture to market. Fonesalesman says it will differentiate itself by offering shipping anywhere in the world, and also because the table is of high quality and easy to assemble.

If you like the idea of the FurniQi, you can back it on Indiegogo in October. The company says if the campaign succeeds, early backers will receive their tables in time for Christmas this year. Pricing is still to be determined, but they're aiming to be competitive with similar IKEA products.

Smart cooling from dumb air conditioners with Tado|"

BERLIN -- After finding success making smart thermostats for European homes, German startup Tado is expanding to the US. The product making its way across the pond isn't a thermostat, but rather, a $199 Wi-Fi accessory for nonconnected air conditioner units. Place Tado in the air conditioner's line of sight, and it'll command the unit using the same infrared connection the remote uses. From there, you'll be able to control it remotely through Tado's app on Android, iOS or Windows devices, or program it to turn on and off automatically at specific times, or as you come and go.

The device was on full display at the IFA tech conference in Germany, where Tado announced it'd soon be getting its own channel on  IFTTT , the popular online automation service. That opens the door for crafty home automation enthusiasts to sync their air conditioners up with  other IFTTT-compatible smart home tech.

Small, flat and white, Tado looks a bit like a newfangled thermostat, complete with attractive LED animations and touch button controls. You can mount it to the wall or sit it on a shelf, just so long as it stays plugged in and in direct sight of your AC unit.

To track your comings and goings, Tado pairs with your phone via Wi-Fi. You can connect multiple people with a single Tado -- when it detects that the last person has left, it'll shut the air off. When it senses the first person coming home, it'll turn the air on again. If needed, you can override these automated decisions in the app by switching into manual mode and dialing the temperature up and down yourself. You can also continue to use your air conditioner the old-fashioned way, or by tapping on Tado's touchscreen.

All in all, it's a pretty appealing gadget, especially for anyone who's interested in smart climate control but unable or unwilling to replace their thermostat.  Other smart air conditioners we've tested  have cost around $300 or more -- purchase Tado and hook it up with the air conditioner you've already got, and you'll be getting much of the same functionality for less. Of course, it won't work if your air conditioner doesn't have an infrared remote.

It'll also need to compete with established players in the US smart cooling market, including  the now third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat , the  HomeKit-compatible Ecobee3  and the  Honeywell Lyric . None of those work directly with window AC units, though, so perhaps Tado is playing it smart by staking out fresh turf. Of course, it'll need to fend off competition from other startups with similar strategies, too. The fact that Tado is already fairly well-established in Europe should help, as they've had plenty of time to refine the software based on user feedback.

You can find Tado for sale on Amazon and at retailers like Best Buy, B&H and soon at Home Depot, as well. We plan on testing one out for ourselves in the near future -- we'll let you know how it does with a full review.

Netatmo adds a Wind Gauge to its connected weather sensors|"

BERLIN -- We liked  Netatmo's connected weather station  well enough when we reviewed it last June. It tracked local weather conditions on your phone with enough accuracy to be informative, especially for niche users. The company expanded a few months ago with a Rain Gauge accessory. Now it adds a Wind Gauge, an obvious, but useful extension to an effective product line.

The Wind Gauge will cost $99 in the US, and £99 in the UK when it launches in mid-October. You need to already own a Netatmo Weather Station to use it, since the Wind Gauge feeds its data directly back to the Weather Station, which in turn will show you the wind data through an updated version of its existing app.

Yes, $99 is expensive for a wind gauge, not counting the extra $150 you'll need to have spent for the Weather Station. Even very nice, non-connected wind gauges are available for less. This is one of the few (only?) units that transmits data to your phone, though. It also features a handy graphing utility within the Netatmo weather app that tracks wind behavior over time.

Netatmo  Wind Gauge has no moving parts, instead relying on four sensors that measure wind speed and directionality. The company says the gauge is accurate to around 0.5 km/hour (about 0.3 mph) in winds under 100 km/hour (62 mph). Accuracy drops to plus-or-minus 2km/hour (1.2 mph) at faster speeds, and it becomes too inaccurate to be useful in gusts over 160 km/hour (99 mph). Any hurricane over category 1 will render the Wind Gauge useless. Sorry, storm chasers.

You'll also find some limits if you want to use the Wind Gauge in extreme temperatures. At an unspecified ""normal"" range of temperatures, per the company, the AA batteries will last between 1.5 and 2 years. At extremes of cold, the battery life drops to around one year.

As with other Netatmo products, the Wind Gauge will work with both Android and iOS devices. The company says updated versions of its app for both operating systems will be live when it ships in October.

A bigger, brighter Lightstrip makes its Philips Hue debut|"

BERLIN -- The Philips Hue line of Internet-connected, color-changing LED lights has always been a bit of a smart home novelty, and  Philips Hue's Lightstrips  have always embraced that novelty head-on by offering the flexibility to put connected color control just about anywhere you like. Now, at the IFA tech conference in Germany, Philips is flipping the switch on its second-gen strips, the Philips Hue Lightstrips Plus, available this October for $90, or €80/£60 in the EU (pricing is yet to be announced for Australia, but the US price converts roughly to about AU$130, the same as you'll spend for the original Lightstrips).

The ""Plus"" sums up a few key enhancements over the original Lightstrips. First is extendability. While the Lightstrips themselves are still 2 meters long, that isn't a fixed length like it was before -- you'll be able to purchase additional 1-meter extension strips for $30/€25 each that clip on up to a maximum length of 10 meters. The new strips are dramatically brighter, too, with 1,600 lumens at max brightness compared to just 120 lumens in generation one.

That bump comes by way of new white-light diodes that sit alongside the color-changing RGB diodes, which also brings tunable white light into play for the first time. Unlike the first Lightstrips, which shine in RGB colors only, the new ones also offer shades of natural white light ranging from an orangey 2,000K to a bluish 6,500K.

I'll be curious to see if that brightness bump only applies to the white light tones, or if the colors shine brighter than before, too. With some color-changing smart lights like the  Tabu Lumen LED , the white light diodes are kept entirely separate from the RBG diodes, meaning that the colored light is much dimmer than the white light. Others, like the  Lifx LED , let you add those white diodes in on top of whatever color you've selected, giving you bright, tinted light that takes full advantage of everything under the hood. Philips would be wise to tack in the latter direction.

Something else worth noting is that, like before, the Lightstrips Plus won't work without a Philips Hue Bridge plugged into your router to translate the Zigbee signal. You won't get a bridge with the strips, and it isn't sold separately, either. The only way to get one (short of buying a used one on eBay) is to purchase a three-bulb  Philips Hue Starter Pack  for $200 (€200/£150/AU$290). Coupled with the price of the strips, that's an awfully high cost of entry for color-changing light.

If you're willing to take the plunge, or if you're an existing Hue user ready for an upgrade, you'll enjoy full integration with the rest of the Philips Hue family, including this year's new releases, the  Philips Hue Go  portable LED fixture and the  Philips Hue Wireless Dimming Kit .

You'll also be able to sync your strips up with the wealth of third-party apps and integrations built to work with Hue. That includes a channel on IFTTT, compatibility with high-profile control devices like  SmartThings ,  Wink , and  Amazon Echo, and even apps that'll set the strips to change color in rhythm with the music you're listening to, or in theme with the video game you're playing.

You'll find the new Lightstrips Plus wherever Hue products are sold this October. Australian availability is yet to be determined, though Hue products are already sold there. That includes the original Lightstrips, which currently sell for AU$130. Philips says they'll keep us posted -- we'll keep our Aussie readers posted in turn.

The Smarter Kettle 2.0 promises improved brains for water boiling|"

BERLIN -- Connected appliance maker Smarter hopes to streamline your morning ritual with its new product, the £99.99 iKettle 2.0. Announced at the IFA electronics show, this gadget is a follow up to the company's previous stab at an intelligent and Wi-Fi linked water heater, the  Smarter iKettle . Now boasting increased intelligence and an improved companion mobile app, Smarter claims the iKettle 2.0 will offer a host of fresh features and even have the brains to tweak its morning boiling schedule based on local traffic conditions.

With a slimmed down size and shape including a revamped base, physically the iKettle 2.0 is smaller than its predecessor. Though Smarter hasn't yet disclosed specific details regarding the iKettle 2.0's exact dimensions, it's clear the new gadget has a diminished footprint. Most notable is the stainless steel kettle's lack of a bulky stand.

While the older model sits atop a square base featuring controls for water temperature and power, the updated iKettle rests upon a short cylindrical cradle. Plain and entirely devoid of buttons save a sole circular power key, the stand lends the appliance a clean, more spartan look.

Despite a trimmer appearance, Smarter says the iKettle 2.0 is slightly thinner and taller too, the product will hold the same maximum volume of water (1.8 liters, 60.9 ounces). That's a lot of hot water to have on hand especially compared to drip coffee makers which tend to top out at 1.3L or about 44 ounces.

There's a reason for the iKettle's large water reservoir. Instead of filling the machine with liquid from the tap each time you seek a hot beverage, Smarter envisions a scenario where the product is always topped off. Indeed, thanks to an integrated Wi-Fi radio, the iKettle 2.0 will regularly ping your mobile device with alerts concerning current water level and temperature status.

Likewise you'll be able to command the kettle to begin boiling remotely, courtesy of an Android and iOS mobile application, plus program the gadget to operate in advance say first thing in the morning. Additionally the product offers the flexibility to heat water at precise temperatures, specifically a range between 20 to 100 Celsius (68 to 212 Farenheit).

I find a few new functions particularly interesting. A Home mode can handily kick off the AM water boil timed to your morning alarm or when you arrive home after a grueling day. The wildest of the iKettle 2.0's promised abilities, however, is the Early Bird mode which enables the appliance to keep tabs on traffic conditions in real time and bump up its boil time earlier if necessary.

According to Smarter, the Smarter Kettle 2.0 is immediately available for purchase in the UK for  £99.99 through online retailer Firebox. Smarter will also sell the product in Europe for €140 and in the US as well, though the company hasn't disclosed pricing for that market."
Nest Learning Thermostat (2015) review:|"

Editors' note, June 10, 2016: This review has been updated to include information on Nest's integration with Amazon Alexa, as well as its new Family Accounts and Home/Away Assist features.

Nest has already had a busy year, with a new  home security camera  and a new  smoke and carbon monoxide detector, as well as checking off a major overhaul of its companion Android and iPhone apps from the corporate to-do list. But now the Google-owned smart-home company is returning to its roots with the launch of its third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat.

The new model uses an all-new design with a larger screen and slimmer profile, plus it adds a couple of new features to the mix. Like the original Nest -- which launched back in 2011 -- the third-gen iteration of its heating and cooling control system relies on built-in sensors to track your whereabouts along with algorithmic smarts to create a custom, auto-adjusting temperature schedule based on those movements in the home. And you can still make manual tweaks to your settings on the Nest app anywhere you have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection.

But those once-revolutionary features are now par for the smart-home course, with brands like  Ecobee  and  Honeywell  offering smart thermostats of their own designed to compete alongside Nest in the DIY market.

Fortunately for Nest, version 3.0 ups the ante with an even-more-gorgeous-than-before design and the introduction of a far-field sensor for viewing the current time and temperature from a distance as well as integration with Alexa-friendly Amazon products. The US-only third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat enters the more competitive landscape for the same $249 price as its predecessor -- any remaining  second-gen models  will retail at the reduced price of $199 while supplies last -- but I can still wholeheartedly recommend it as a truly smart heating and cooling upgrade.

You know how your smartphone doesn't look dated until you catch a glimpse of the next-gen model? That's exactly how I felt after seeing Nest's latest Learning Thermostat. No, it isn't a massive departure from past iterations. You'll still get that same rounded design, stainless-steel dial and familiar display style. But, there are a few key changes.

The third-generation thermostat has a 40 percent larger screen and an improved resolution for better all-around visibility. (Specifically, the display has 229 pixels per inch; that's 25 percent more than its predecessor, which should make for a sharper on-screen image.) And, Nest slimmed down the thermostat's profile so it won't stick out from the wall as much.

While I noticed the updated display size and resolution instantly, the ""thinner"" depth was much less obvious. A side-by-side spec comparison shows that the second-gen Nest measured 3.2 inches in diameter (8.1cm) and 1.26 inches in depth (3.2cm). The new thermostat is a touch bigger at 3.3 inches in diameter (8.4cm), but slimmer with a depth of 1.21 inches (3.1cm).

That tiny 0.05-inch difference really doesn't make much of a difference, but other upgrades give the rounded Nest an even bigger edge over the touchpad-style and now somewhat dated-looking  Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart  or  Ecobee3, two of its closest competitors in the smart thermostat market.

The third-gen Nest Learning Thermostat also boasts a handful of new features. Where previous Nest thermostats relied on near-field sensors alone (which have a roughly 3-foot range) to pick up on motion activity, this version tacks on a far-field sensor for a new function it calls Farsight. Farsight lets you see your thermostat's target temperature or the current time in either ""analog"" or digital modes from a distance. That way, you can spot the time and temperature at a distance, without having to be on top of the Nest.

This may seem like a small update, but it actually brings a new level of interactivity to the hardware side. Where the previous model would only ""wake up"" when you were within about 3 feet (1 meter), you can now interact with the unit without having to walk directly by it. Instead, you can get an at-a-glance look at the time or the temperature from as far as 20 feet away. And, thanks to the new and improved resolution and the larger display, you'll actually be able to read them.

Nest 3.0 also offers Family Accounts and Home/Away Assist, two new features that help improve performance. Family Accounts lets users in the same household set up their own Nest accounts (instead of the shared family accounts that the company offered previously). Once Family Accounts are created, Home/Away Assist jumps into action by tracking each person's phone location. It isn't exactly the same as geofencing, as there's no geofenced range, but it does make it even easier for Nest to keep an eye on your whereabouts.

This model also adds a function it calls Furnace Heads-Up, for those with a forced-air furnace system. Essentially, this feature keeps track of the times your forced-air furnace automatically turns off to prevent overheating. And, if it senses that there's a potential issue, it will alert you in the Nest app, on the thermostat screen and in your monthly energy usage email. Nest says it will add this feature to first- and second-generation Nest thermostats ""later this year.""

But Nest is missing one thing: remote temperature sensors. Ecobee's $249, £155, AU$285 Ecobee3 thermostat comes with a remote temperature sensor and you can buy additional two-packs for $79 each. This allows you to closely monitor temperatures on a room-by-room basis. Say you set your thermostat to 72 degrees, but the remote-temperature sensor in your bedroom says it's 75 degrees -- you can then adjust your thermostat so that it cools until your bedroom actually reaches the target temp.

While there are some clear design and feature differences between this Nest and previous iterations, version 3.0's installation, Wi-Fi and app configuration, performance and overall usability remain roughly the same.

Of course, installation will vary widely depending on your heating and cooling system, but the third-gen Nest Learning Thermostat is by far the easiest model I've ever installed. It comes with the same tiny, but functional screwdriver and built-in level as well as a basic rectangular baseplate for covering up any unsightly holes or patchy paintwork from previous installs and a steel plate for mounting your thermostat to an electrical box.

It took me about 10 minutes to install my model from start to finish; here's a quick overview of the process:

Now you're ready to configure your Nest. Your unit will power on and walk you through the process, which includes: setting your language; connecting to your local Wi-Fi network; updating any out-of-date software; setting your location; answering some basic questions about your HVAC system; inputing your preferred temperature ranges for heating and cooling; and performing a quick (optional) system test.

This sounds like a lot, but you can breeze through most of it pretty quickly; if you aren't sure what sort of HVAC system you have, you can select ""I don't know"" and return to it later on. And, if you don't already have a Nest account, you can now download the app on your Android or iOS device of choice and dive into custom preferences, such as Farsight, vacation modes and integrating with other Nest products and third-party smart devices.

While models like the  Ecobee3 , the US-only $249  Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart  and US-only $279  Honeywell Lyric  also have related apps and innovative smart tech of their own (Ecobee3 relies on a remote temperature sensor and built-in motion sensors to track your home or away status plus  has its own IFTTT channel and HomeKit compatibility; the Wi-Fi Smart has a Nest-style learning algorithm; and the Lyric uses your phone's GPS location), Nest has the most comprehensive smart functionality of all three of its major competitors.

Like previous models, the third-gen Nest works with the  Nest Cam  and the  Nest Protect  for a variety of in-app automations and has its own IFTTT channel. I tried out an IFTTT recipe that automatically turned my Nest thermostat on when I got within a certain radius of home and it worked incredibly well.

It's also likely that we'll see new thermostat-related third-party integrations via Nest's  Works with Nest initiative, as well as  Google's Android-based Brillo operating system, which was announced earlier this year. And now that Nest will be operating as a more independent business unit within  Google's new Alphabet holding company, we'll be curious to see if the newly unfettered Nest will be adding any more arrows to its smart-home quiver -- smart locks, anyone?

Nest now works with Amazon's Alexa, too, via the Alexa Skills Kit. Just go to the Alexa app and enable the Nest thermostat skill. Then you can ask, ""Alexa, change the downstairs thermostat to 68 degrees,"" ""Alexa, raise the downstairs thermostat by 3 degrees,"" and a whole lot more. This voice control integration goes a long way to help Nest maintain its stronghold in the smart thermostat market, as models like the Ecobee3 also work with Alexa as well as Apple's HomeKit.

The $249 third-gen Nest Learning Thermostat is no longer the revolutionary product it was in 2011, but the Google/Alphabet-owned brand has managed to maintain its status as a smart-climate-control leader in spite of the rapidly changing landscape. Its Alexa integration, larger display, improved resolution and new Farsight, Family Accounts and Home/Away Assist features only add to its already impressive performance and ease-of-use via the smartly-designed Nest app.

Ecobee may be closing the gap with its IFTTT channel, new HomeKit and Alexa integrations and remote temperature sensors, but Nest still wins my vote in terms of overall design and usability. If you already have a second-gen Nest at home, you don't necessarily need to splurge on this model, but folks shopping for their first connected thermostat should definitely look to the $249 Nest Learning Thermostat.

Turn off the power running to your heating and cooling system.Remove your existing thermostat.Attach the new base plate (optional) and thermostat base. Screw them down with the included hardware (Luckily, I already had holes that lined up with the new thermostat, which saved me some time.).Connect the wires to their respective ports. In my case, that included Y, G, W, Rh and C wires (Please note: Many older systems rely on a four-wire configuration -- typically just a Y, G, W, and Rh or Rc -- because older thermostats didn't need to power fancy LED displays. Confusingly, some four-wire configurations will actually work with this thermostat. Consult a professional if you have any questions or concerns. Nest has experienced some friction since its four-wire setup relies on a process HVAC professionals refer to as ""power stealing."" This method can damage your HVAC system if not done correctly. I had a second-gen Nest set up using just these four wires for years without any problems whatsoever.)Pop on the face plate.Turn the power back on. (Didn't work? Here's Nest's more in-depth installation tutorial.)"
iHome iSP5 SmartPlug review:|"

The iHome iSP5 SmartPlug has an ace up its sleeve. On its own, it doesn't do anything extraordinary. Plug it into a wall socket, plug one of your ordinary electronic devices into it -- such as a lamp -- and connect the iHome Plug to your Wi-Fi network, and you'll be able to control the socket remotely and smarten up an otherwise dumb device. It's a cool idea and an easy way to try out smart-home technology at a reasonable price, but it's an idea shared by more than a  dozen other connected devices.

Most of those competing smart plugs do more than iHome's version. The  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch  monitors energy usage and lets you program your plug with online automation service  IFTTT. Other plugs offer  surge protection , or antennas for  Bluetooth  or  ZigBee , making it so they can act as bridges for other smart devices.

The iHome plug does one thing only, and there can be setup glitches. Once it's up and running, it does its task quickly and consistently. Despite that, iHome would be largely forgettable except that it works with HomeKit, Apple's proprietary smart-home software. That software allows you to control the iSP5 with your voice, and iHome's iOS app makes it easy to organize your smart home with HomeKit. Soon, iHome could get lost among the competition once  more well-rounded HomeKit plugs hit the market. For now, the iHome SmartPlug does just enough to be worth a look as an inexpensive way to start a Siri smart home.

You can purchase the iHome iSP5 SmartPlug now from the company's site and Amazon for $39.99. It's compatible with iOS and Android  via the free iHome Control app. The iSP5 is not currently available  overseas.

Made by iHome, an electronics company best known for its speakers, the plug looks simple and unassuming, with a white front and back nicely accented by a gray top and sides. It's small, as it should be, and designed to extend horizontally so as to only take up one outlet when in place.

Plug it in, then plug in the device you want to control. Lamps and fans are obvious choices, but the iHome SmartPlug will work with anything as long as it doesn't use more than 1,800 watts of power.

A button in the top right corner allows you to turn the switch on and off manually -- a nice touch. Press it and you'll hear the familiar, pleasing click of turning on a lamp. When the switch is on, the company logo in the bottom left corner shines white. In the upper right, a small green LED lets you know you have a Wi-Fi signal.

That LED could prove problematic for some, as it's always lit when the plug is connected, so it could be bothersome in a dark room such as a bedroom.

In order to make the iSP5 useful, you'll need to sync it with your home Wi-Fi Network. The app will guide you through the steps of the process, which can be as easy as holding the button on the SmartPlug to reset it, then adding a new device to your iHome Control app and picking the right network.

The process can be that simple, but on numerous occasions, particularly on Android, we found that it wasn't. (There turned out to be a simple solution to our problems, which I'll explain below.) After you reset the plug, you'll press a button in the app to add a new device. You'll identify the device with an eight-digit PIN you'll find on a sticker on the bottom of the plug or on the quick-start guide included with the package.

The plug then connects to your Android phone, and uses your phone to search for and connect to your Wi-Fi router. Except, on numerous occasions, as my phone switched from my Wi-Fi signal to the plug's for the sake of that direct connection, I saw an error message, ""Start session timeout,"" and had to start over.

After a couple of tries, my phone made it past this step, and I was able to identify the correct Wi-Fi signal and input my password. iHome connected the plug and started ""Finishing Wi-Fi setup"" and then stopped. The app spun in place for a while, then told me no device was found and took me back to the add-device screen.

After this setup glitch, the plug looked like it had found my network. Its LED blinks green after a reset while it's searching for a signal, and turns solid green once it finds one. The Android setup resulted in a solid green signal, but the plug was nowhere to be found in the app, and since it wasn't blinking green anymore, I had to reset the plug again to get the app to register a nearby new device so I could try setting it up again.

This happened numerous times on my  Samsung Galaxy S5 . A coworker's S5 ran into the same problem a couple of times, but eventually made it through the setup. Another Android phone, the Nexus 6, ran into the same hurdle that my phone did, and was also unable to make it through the process.

Eventually, after talking to representatives from iHome, we found a fix  to the issue. With certain versions of Android Lollipop, you have to  turn off your mobile data to prevent it from interfering with the plug's  signal during setup. Sure enough, once I did that, I finally got the  setup to finish.

On iOS, the process was seamless, or at least it was the first time I set up the plug. The iHome app is obviously much more in tune with Apple hardware than Android, and it connects the plug to your Wi-Fi network much more quickly. You'll still need to enter the PIN for the device, and your Wi-Fi password if you have one. Otherwise, getting connected to your Wi-Fi network is quick and painless.

You'll encounter a couple of extra steps beyond connecting to your router with the iOS app, but these relate to organizing your home into HomeKit's buckets. To review, HomeKit runs in the background of  iOS 8 , and enables compatible third-party devices to talk to each other via a standard set of rules, allowing you to organize devices from various companies and control them by voice via Siri.

You'll be prompted to name your home, HomeKit's biggest bucket, as soon as you open the iOS app and create your iHome account. Then, you'll connect your plug and provide it with a name, and you can even assign it to a room and that room to a zone if you want to take advantage of all of HomeKit's organizational structure. There's no need to set up zones unless you have several HomeKit devices, but iHome deserves credit for making it easy to do in the app.

To share control of the device, select ""user management"" under the settings tab of the app. You can even share a device from an iOS to an Android device, though it doesn't work the other way around.

You can invite multiple family members to share control of your device. Specifically, you share access to all devices within a home. You can't specify control beyond HomeKit's biggest bucket, but at there's at least some separation of what you're sharing. So, for example, your partner can manipulate anything you set up at your place without gaining control of the devices you have at your office.

You'll need to give additional users a PIN if you want them to be able to control your devices remotely, and I like the extra security step. It's one thing to let a friend play with your smart devices while they're visiting and using your Wi-Fi, it's another to grant them control at any time, from anywhere. Even with the PIN, additional users will never be able to rename or alter the settings of your devices.

That PIN setting, though smart in theory, ended up contributing to a few glitches I discovered while trying to reset the plug. Fortunately, you won't need to do this if you're just moving it around within your home. Unplugging it and replugging it doesn't reset the settings. Give it a moment after you plug it back in, and it'll hop right back onto the established network.

You will need to reset the plug if you move it from your home to your office and want to set it up on a different network. When you do that, you won't be able to use the same name for the plug you used before, which was a shame for me, as I'd wanted to keep using the name ""Bat Signal.""

You can get your used names back if you really want to, but you'll have to reset all of your HomeKit buckets in your device settings to do so.

The minor annoyance of picking a new name aside, setting up the plug a second time revealed a few flaws in the iOS app. On a couple of occasions, the app couldn't find the plug for the second setup. I had to reset the plug again, and restart my iPad to get it to work. On another occasion, I couldn't change the name for the plug I set up. The app was convinced I wasn't the creator of the home, and thus, locked me out of this feature, even though I was using the same device with the same log-in as when I initially set it up.

On yet another occasion, after I reset the plug, I added a new device, took it through the setup process and then got an error message telling me the device was reset, taking me back to step 1, even though I'd completed the process of getting it connected. I was stuck in that loop for a while. I'd reset the plug to allow the app to find it, go through the setup process, name the plug, then get the error message and have to start over.

Old plugs tend to linger next to dead buttons on your app and new ones can take a long time to populate on the apps of additional users. It'll get there eventually for your family members, but if you want to use a different Apple device yourself, it might never happen. Using the same iCloud account and the same iHome log-in on an iPhone that I used on my iPad, I couldn't see the homes or devices I'd set up, no matter what I tried. I'm not sure if that issue is on Apple or iHome, but I found it majorly annoying.

The setup issues I encountered with the iOS app were mostly minor, but they show that the software of the iHome SmartPlug still needs polishing.

Once it was up and running, I enjoyed using the iHome iSP5 SmartPlug on iOS. It's responsive. The app has a tab for your devices, with a button just to the left of their names, letting you switch them on and off, and they react almost instantaneously.

The app has tab for your home where you can you organize your devices into the various HomeKit buckets, and it also has a tab for rules. Thanks to online rule maker IFTTT, I've come to expect a lot of rule systems with smart devices. Via IFTTT, you can train your devices to work together in lots of useful and interesting ways. When your phone senses you're home, you can have your lights turn on, your doors unlock and your garage door open. When it's time for bed, you can have your place lock itself down and adjust the thermostat accordingly.

With iHome's plug, the rule system is just a timer, meaning you can set times when you want your various devices to turn on or off. The timer is smart enough that if you've set it to turn off at 10 p.m. and it's already off, it won't switch it back on, but it's still a pretty simple system.

Supposedly, more advanced rule functionality is coming to HomeKit with  iOS 9 . At that point, this plug could come closer to reaching its potential as an interconnected device if it can respond to input from other HomeKit sensors.

You can tell Siri to flip your device on or off, too, and I quite enjoyed trying out the many possible voice commands.

In addition to a settings tab, letting you add users and edit your account, the last tab in the iHome Control app lets you set scenes. You can pick from the predetermined scenes such as ""Dining"" or ""Party"" or you can name your own.

Scenes let you program multiple devices to respond to a single command. As with buckets, it's very much overkill for a single plug, but it'll get much more useful as HomeKit's device lineup fills out. Plus, setting scenes with Siri is awesome.

I programmed my lamp to turn on when I set the dining scene. Then, I simply told Siri to, ""Set the dining scene."" She responded, ""Your wish is my command. And lo, Dining Scene."" My light turned on and I laughed at the surprising display of competent smart-home voice controls with personality to boot.

Similarly, you can control your devices by name directly (""Turn on the Bat Signal!"") Finally, you can control devices by the name of your buckets as well. So I could tell Siri to turn off all devices in my home, ""Gotham,"" or the zone I specified for my lamp, ""Wayne Manor.""

HomeKit makes these voice commands possible, but it's iHome's app that makes it easy to organize your devices into HomeKit's buckets and -- once you get through the setup process -- makes using your device with HomeKit fun.

HomeKit isn't perfect. With iOS 9, you'll supposedly be able to control your devices remotely just by linking them to iCloud. For now, to give Siri commands when you're not home, you'll need an  Apple TV , and a ton of patience to wade through the confusing and tedious setup process.

The iHome Plug allows you to get around this by just opening the app and controlling your device with buttons when you're not home. Since it connects directly to your Wi-Fi router, it doesn't need HomeKit to enable all remote functionality as the  Elgato Eve Room  with its Bluetooth-only signal does.

If you do want Siri controls on the go, you'll need to have an iCloud account linked to an iCloud.com email address, then you'll need to turn on the iCloud Keychain in your device settings, then you'll probably need to sign out and sign back into to both your Apple TV
 and your device, and possibly even reset your HomeKit buckets on your device to get it to work. It's a pain.

With iOS 9, the setup could be streamlined. iOS 9 will supposedly also enable push notifications and more advanced rules linking devices from different parties. In other words, if you want simple voice controls, HomeKit and the iHome Plug are ready for you now. If you want more than that, you'll need to wait, and that could be a problem for the iHome SmartPlug. Right now, it's one of the few HomeKit-compatible options on the market, which makes its lack of features acceptable. Soon, it'll have lots more competition, and since it only does one thing, it could easily get lost in the crowd.

Coming in October, the  iDevices switch  will cost only $10 more than the iHome SmartPlug. It'll connect directly to your Wi-Fi router, but will also include a Bluetooth antenna, allowing you to bridge Bluetooth specific peripherals to the cloud. Upcoming HomeKit locks such as the Schlage Sense will take advantage of that feature.

The  Grid Connect ConnectSense Smart Outlet  ups the price to $80, but includes two smart outlets, a USB port and a ZigBee antenna, again allowing it to double as a bridge.

If you just want to control lights, the  Lutron Caseta Wireless Lighting Starter Kit  is available now, and permits dimming as well, but you have to purchase the whole kit for $230 to get this functionality.

Insteon  has a  plug  that can work with HomeKit, but it's a $60 model you need to install, and you need to buy the HomeKit-compatible  Insteon Hub  to make it work. Preorders for that hub shipped this summer, and it'll be widely available soon.

There are many non-HomeKit options, the most notable of which is the $60  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch , which monitors energy usage and allows remote control of your outlet. Belkin's Plug is also compatible with IFTTT, allowing you to connect it to IFTTT's broad library of smart home products.

Because of the many available smart plugs, I'd pass on the iHome version if you have an Android device. Even once you do get past the buggy setup, the app is bare-bones. You don't have any voice control, or organizational systems. You can see your devices listed and set those time-based rules, and that's it.

The iHome iSP5 sits in a precarious position. On the one hand, I have trouble recommending it now, because both the iHome Control app and Apple's HomeKit still need polish. On the other hand, waiting on the iHome SmartPlug probably won't make it look better, as  more well-rounded HomeKit devices will hit the market soon.

I'm allowing myself a third hand here, because once you get it set up, the iHome SmartPlug works well enough with your iOS device now that it makes sense for those looking for simple smart control of home items like lamps and fans. At $40, it's also not unreasonably priced. It's just too feature-poor to recommend. You should definitely look elsewhere if you're an Android user. HomeKit helps a little bit if you have iOS, but even that advantage -- the ace up its sleeve -- will disappear soon."
No hub, no app -- just plug-and-play smart lighting from Philips Hue|"

There are a lot of things I like about Philips' approach to smart lighting, but at $200 for a Philips Hue starter pack, the cost of entry isn't one of them. That's about to change, though, as Philips is adding a new Hue Wireless Dimming Kit to its catalog. Inside, you'll find a dimmable, white-light smart bulb and a nifty wall switch that doubles as a magnetic remote. The cost? $40.

Diminished along with the price is the role of Philips Hue Bridge and app, both of which are mandatory for full control over existing Philips Hue products. That's not the case with this new kit. You don't need the Philips Hue Bridge, and you don't need to download the Philips Hue app. Just screw the bulb in and turn it on, then pull on a little piece of plastic at the bottom of the remote to activate its battery. The two will pair automatically, and you'll be controlling your bulb within seconds. Additional bulbs are $20 a piece -- the remote can control up to 10 of them in tandem.

That's about as simple as smart lighting gets -- some might argue too simple. To be clear, the ""Philips Hue White"" bulbs that pair directly with the included remote don't change colors or color temperatures, and without a Philips Hue Bridge, they won't sync up with the wealth of third-party apps, services and gadgets that work with Philips Hue. That means no  Nest, no  IFTTT, no  Amazon Echo, no anything. You can't even schedule the lights to turn on and off at specific times.

Of course, if you do have a Philips Hue Bridge, or if you're willing to buy a Philips Hue starter pack to get one (Philips doesn't sell the Bridge on its own), then you'll be able to add the new Philips Hue White bulbs into your larger setup and enjoy those deeper controls and integrations. The same goes for the switch. Pair it with a bridge, and you'll be able to customize which lights it turns on and off from within the app, or put existing Philips Hue products under its control.

In that sense, the Wireless Dimming Kit seems a bit like smart-home bait. Try it out, and it's likely that you'll end up wanting more out of it -- at that point, plunking down the extra cash for a full-featured Hue setup will be a lot harder to resist.

That said, I was impressed with the kit when I tested it out. Setup really couldn't have been simpler -- I was dialing the light up and down mere seconds after opening the box. Those dimming controls are especially good, too. At the lowest setting, the bulb puts out just 7 lumens -- less than 1 percent of the bulb's full brightness.

That full brightness came in right on the money, clocking in at 801 lumens in our test rig (the claimed light output is 800 lumens). You'll get that brightness from a power draw of 9.5 watts, which is excellent for a smart bulb. Only the  Osram Lightify  and  Belkin WeMo LEDs  are more efficient among smart bulbs, and each only incrementally so. Each one also costs an extra $10 per bulb.

As for the switch, you can mount it wherever you like using screws or sticky tape, no wiring needed. It's also magnetic. The remote pops right out when you want it, then nestles in magnetically when you don't.

The Philips Hue Wireless Dimming Kit is scheduled to arrive in North American retail outlets this September, and will replace the existing white light smart option from Philips, the  Philips Hue Lux Starter Kit . Expect a full review closer to that time."
Bring heat between your sheets with BedJet v2|"

In search of the perfect night's sleep, BedJet v2 is back on Kickstarter and aiming to increase its brain power over the first version of the hot-and-cold fan you slip under your sheets. Already past its goal more than 15 times over, BedJet v2 adds sleep cycle smarts to its temp control system. Complete with customizable settings, BedJet's new brain will aim to help you sleep deeper and longer, and wake up more refreshed by automatically adjusting the temperature of the air it's blowing throughout the night to match the natural changes in your body's temp as you sleep.

BedJet fits a nozzle underneath your bedding, and gently blows warm or cold air over you throughout the night. The original version found success on Kickstarter back in 2013, and is available for $500 from BedJet, LLC's website (the international price is $529, which converts to approximately £340 and AU$717 for our readers in the UK and Australia, respectively). Version 2 adds in those adjustable night-long hot and cold cycles and should ultimately sell for a similarly high retail price, but it isn't available for delivery to Australia yet.

The basics of BedJet v2 will stay largely the same as  the first version. On its website, BedJet rails against the inefficiency and poor design of electric blankets, so BedJet keeps all electronic pieces out of your bed.

The installation video makes the process seem simple enough. Place the engine under your bed and attach it to a nozzle nestled just over your bottom sheet. Connect the two with an expandable hose and secure the hose and the nozzle in place with a bracket held between your mattress and your box spring.

You can then make your bed with your top sheet over the nozzle and when you lie down, you can turn on BedJet with the included remote control or the iOS and Android app. Like the original BedJet, BedJet v2 connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth LE. BedJet blows hot air or cold air, and you can buy a pack of two BedJets along with the company's AirComforter that separates the airflow of the two sides of a queen- or king-size bed. A couple can then set two different temperatures without interfering with the temp on the other side of the bed.

If you don't want the air blowing on you directly, you can put the nozzle over the top of your cover sheet, and beneath your blanket or comforter. BedJet also has a neutral setting for air that's not heated or cooled if you just want circulation. The fan looks to gently lift the sheets as it works, and can supposedly cool off your covers within 10 seconds, and warm them within three minutes. BedJet does specify, though, that the fan should not be used in place of an air conditioning unit, as it's less effective in rooms above 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius).

Since I don't like air blowing on me, I'm not sure how well it'd work for my own sleeping needs. Yes, you can put the air stream above the top sheet, but I think you'd still feel it on your face. And since it needs a cover over it to keep the air stream focused, I'd be worried it would lose its potency on the nights when I toss and turn and kick the covers out of place.

Perhaps the new smarts of BedJet v2 will help with this. The idea is that your body temp lowers as you sink deeper into sleep and raises as you wake up. BedJet gently keeps things cool during those deep parts of your rest, then warms things up to help you rise and shine feeling refreshed. If it works, that means less tossing and turning. BedJet even goes so far as to say it can replace your alarm with this system.

I'm just not sure how precise it can be with your sleep cycles without some sort of  connected sleep monitor. Again, BedJet says you can customize everything via the app, but it's often tough for me to predict how I'm going to sleep on any given night, and if it starts cooling me off before I'm out and ends up waking me back up by accident, I'd be pretty angry.

The basics seem mostly sound here, even if I'm unconvinced of the smarts. If a fan that cools you or heats you from within your bed appeals to you, now is a good time to buy in, as the preorder deals on Kickstarter take more than 50 percent off of the $500 retail price of BedJet v1.

Given that the hardware is already all set, BedJet v2 is also relatively low risk for a Kickstarter project. With an expected delivery date of December 2015, the company will even offer a refund if you don't get your unit by December 24. If it actually leads to deeper sleep and easier wake-up times, BedJet could be money well spent."
Meet Mycroft, an open-source smart-home AI platform|"

The idea of a single product quarterbacking all of the connected gadgets in your home is an appealing one, but smart home hubs from names like  Revolv,  Staples Connect  and  Wink have struggled to break through in recent years. One notable exception is Amazon Echo, a smart-home speaker that brings voice control into the picture. Not surprisingly, a new generation of wannabe hubs is putting a similar emphasis on voice control. The newest we've seen is Mycroft, presumably named after the fictional elder brother of Sherlock Holmes.

Despite looking a bit like an alarm clock, Mycroft is an open-source, AI-powered smart home platform with Raspberry Pi 2 and Arduino controllers at its core. Just say its name, and the Wi-Fi-connected Mycroft will perk up. Give it a command like ""lock the front door"" or ""turn on the porch light,"" and it'll follow suit, working directly with your smart-home gear to carry out your orders.

That's essentially the same approach as Amazon Echo, and at a price of $129 (a little over £80, or about AU$175), Mycroft comes at roughly the same cost, too. Mycroft claims that the difference is in its open source approach, with a variety of open application program interfaces (APIs) powering its voice processing capabilities. Those APIs are the blueprints to building custom code that tells Mycroft how to function; Mycroft's team claims that the open approach helps keep development costs down while improving the product's accuracy and usability.

Combined with the familiar Raspberry Pi and Arduino interfaces, it's an intriguing pitch for anyone hoping to tinker around with the way their smart home hub works (or for anyone looking to borrow software breakthroughs posted online), but it's not a unique one. The more expensive  CastleOS CastleHub  also takes an open approach to its software, as do some established players like the  SmartThings Hub . Even Amazon Echo  released a software development kit (SDK) earlier this year.

Despite the fact that Mycroft is still seeking funding on Kickstarter, the platform already promises compatibility with several key names in the connected home, including SmartThings, IFTTT, Belkin WeMo, Philips Hue, Nest and Lowe's Iris. Mycroft also announced a partnership with the open-sourced, Linux-based Ubuntu that'll put the hacker- and Internet of Things-friendly  Snappy Core Ubuntu operating system in control of each unit.

In addition to wrangling your smart-home gadgets, Mycroft promises to play media by syncing up with popular services like Netflix, YouTube, Pandora and Spotify, then streaming the output to supported devices such as Roku and Chromecast. Like with Amazon Echo, you'll also be able to ask for weather updates or news headlines, ask for spelling and math assistance, or simply ask it to tell you a knock-knock joke.

Under the hood, Mycroft runs on a quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor with 1 GB of memory. You can connect with your home router wirelessly, or connect directly with an Ethernet cable. For extra tinkering flexibility, Mycroft sells an extended version of the hub for $159 (about £100, or AU$215) which includes a backplate that allows easy access to the Raspberry Pi 2's HDMI and USB 2.0 ports, along with the GPIO header.

There are no radios for popular smart-home standards like Bluetooth, Z-Wave or Zigbee inside Mycroft, so you'll still need gateway gadgets like the SmartThings Hub or WeMo Link to connect it with products that broadcast in anything other than Wi-Fi. That makes it more of a voice-powered upgrade for those sorts of smart-home systems, rather than a true all-in-one solution.

Backing Mycroft is a bit of a leap of faith at this point, as the device still needs a good deal of development before production can get underway. With 23 days left in the Kickstarter campaign, it's sitting at about 40 percent of its funding goal -- if Mycroft gets to the finish line, units are estimated to ship out to backers by July 2016."
People Power Presence Security Pack review:|"

I found a lot to like about People Power's  	 	 free Presence app  when I reviewed it back in November of 2014. Here's how it works: Take a spare Android or iOS device -- say, an old smartphone or an iPod Touch -- and stick it anywhere in your home where you'd like to use it as a security camera. Then, use your current everyday Android or iOS device to remotely monitor that video stream. It can track motion-related events, offer live video footage, and even store saved clips in the app. That way, you can approximate a DIY security camera with a device that you probably already have at home. The Presence Security Pack is an optional add-on that offers a more complete security and automation system.

The app is roughly comparable to (although not quite as good as) fellow security camera apps,  	 	 Manything  and  Salient Eye . One issue was that Presence had few third-party integrations, but nevertheless promoted the heck out of its limited-product online store, including the seriously overpriced  Monster Central Power Control Kit .

Now, there's an alternative add-on in the form of People Power's own $299/£190/AU$405 Presence Security Pack. The bundle includes seven smart sensors and a wireless hub to tie them all together. (The sensors and hub use ZigBee wireless rather than Wi-Fi, so the hub needs to be wired into your home network.)

The hub and the sensors included all work very well, but -- even at a better per-sensor price than the Monster -- it's still a comparatively steep investment on what's essentially a free app that repurposes old smartphones, handhelds or tablets around your home. Yes, the sensors are good -- recommendable even -- but I'm not quite sure who will buy them, when a quick online search returns  	 	several results for less.

For your $299, you'll get three door/window sensors, a motion sensor, a temperature sensor, a touch/tamper sensor, a water sensor and a wireless hub to tie them all together. (The sensors and the hub use the ZigBee wireless standard.) Since you're dealing with seven different devices presumably to be planted all over your house, I actually like that these sensors are small and borderline utilitarian-looking with bland white finishes.

But, while they'll blend in well with traditionally light-colored interior doors and door/window frames, the plastic feels cheap -- as if it wouldn't be sturdy enough to endure over time. I have similar complaints with many sensors of this sort, but it does make this kit's particularly high price stand out even more.

The hub comes with a power adapter and an Ethernet cable for quick access to your local network. Start out by connecting the hub to your router (which will bridge all of the ZigBee-enabled sensors to communicate with your Wi-Fi mobile devices) and then download the Presence app on your Android or iOS device of choice.

The Presence app acts as your main point of interaction with the sensors included in People Power's Security Pack. Fortunately, the set-up is very straightforward -- simply follow the instructions in the app to pair each sensor with the hub. This consists of pulling the tab out of every sensor one at a time, then waiting a few seconds until the app automatically recognizes them. You'll then have the opportunity to give each sensor a custom name and actually start using the app as your home-security and automation access point.

Keep in mind that this is all a supplement to People Power's core software,  	 	 the security camera portion of People Power's free Presence app . Its rules section, which approximates the ""If this, then that"" style of the smart-home automation service  IFTTT, is especially robust. While Presence still doesn't have a dedicated IFTTT channel or any other major third-party integrations, you can switch among various modes, including Home (which auto-disarms motion-related alerts), Away, Vacation and Sleep; opt in and out of the Presence camera's motion detection; view your live video feed 24-7; create a ton of custom alerts; and view activity logs that track all of the action.

I took the complete Presence Security Pack to my condo and set up all seven sensors (as well as a secondary iOS device to act as my ""camera""). The three door/window sensors ended up on the front door, the back door and a kitchen window. I placed the motion sensor on a bookcase near the entryway, the temperature sensor on a side table in the living room, the tamper sensor on a candle (I wanted to make sure no one would steal it, OK?), and the water sensor in my dog's water bowl.

The Presence app automatically generated a bunch of rules for each sensor, such as, ""If I go into 'Away' mode and my 'Back door' is open, then notify me on my phone "" and ""If my 'Temperature sensor' goes above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, then notify me on my phone. "" I also created one of my own that said, ""If my 'Water sensor' dries up, then notify me on my phone.""

Everything was extremely responsive. I received notifications when activity took place and had a lot of control over the settings in case I wanted to make tweaks.

The question is, how does the competition compare now that People Power offers a bunch of hardware components?

Manything , an iOS-specific app with an IFTTT channel, does roughly the same thing as the Presence app, but it doesn't offer any Manything-branded devices.  Salient Eye  is another app that transforms camera-equipped Android phones and tablets into security devices with arm and disarm features and a loud siren that's ready to scare off intruders. But it is limited to the software realm just like Manything (aside from Manything's IFTTT channel, which allows you to bring in third-party products). I still like both better in terms of in-app functionality, but People Power is definitely taking a fresh approach to DIY home security.

There's a lot to love about People Power's Presence Security Pack. The devices are easy to set up and use, they perform well, and they offer a fine array of features -- particularly if you want to set ""If this, then that""-style rules within the app (actual  	 	IFTTT integration and other major third party partnerships are noticeably absent).

Even so, $299/£190/AU$405 is pretty darn expensive for seven sensors and a requisite hub. The price is particularly perplexing when you remember that People Power's core service is an app that converts spare Android and iOS devices into security cameras for  	 	free. If you opted for this no-charge alternative to a security camera, would you also likely splurge on a bunch of pricey sensors? That's a significant disconnect that might make the Presence Security Pack a tough sell (even to the most loyal Presence app users), but these smart sensors are still worthy of your consideration."
Edyn Garden Sensor review:|"

On paper, the $100 Edyn Garden Sensor is better than  any other plant sensor I've tested. From your garden's soil, it can send you information and make recommendations on your plant's moisture levels, nutrition levels, temperature, humidity and ambient light. That's an extra parameter or two over the competition. It has iOS and Android apps. It connects to Wi-Fi so you can check on your plant remotely. It even has a solar powered battery that can supposedly last more than 2 years. On top of all of that, it looks beautiful -- as you'd expect from something that was designed by the well-regarded Fuseproject firm under the guidance of Yves Behar.

The good news -- Edyn could get better, someday. The hardware is solid, the meters are mostly accurate and it's as beautiful as advertised. The bad news -- it's currently far from that coveted perfection. The app, though pretty, is the shallowest of any plant sensor I've tested. It's slow, both in responsiveness and in populating recommendations for your plant. It lacks options for customization, and a number of the promised features just aren't working yet. I'm still excited for what Edyn could be, but I don't recommend you buy it until it gets much closer to the perfect paradise that its name implies.

The Edyn Garden Sensor makes a strong first impression. The bright yellow squared top will remind some of blooming daisies, sunflowers, or daffodils. It made me think of the color of Wolverine's comic book uniform, because... of course it did. Either way, all in our office agreed that it looked great.

A squared solar panel runs edge to edge across the top. Underneath it, you'll find a button to turn on the device or check its status once it's up and running. Setup couldn't be simpler and Edyn's free app for both iOS and Android will walk you through every step.

Once it's connected, you can place Edyn into the soil of your garden or in the dirt near your potted plant and let it go to work. Both the metal probe that goes into the soil and the yellow handles underneath the squared top are nice and sturdy. As a result, I was able to push Edyn into solid dirt without any concern that it would bend or break.

Once it's in position, you'll tell Edyn's app about your garden, so it can start offering recommendations for what to plant, and how to care for what plants you have. Again, Edyn measures soil moisture, ambient temperature, soil nutrition, relative humidity and ambient light. Edyn will chart data for each over time, and give you recommendations to help optimize the conditions for your plants based on all five criteria.

The aforementioned iOS and Android apps are free. You can buy the Edyn Garden Sensor for $100 now on Home Depot's website. That price converts to approximately £64 and AU$136 for our readers in the UK and Australia.

The main page of the app looks almost as attractive as the device itself. A diamond split into four pieces gives you a quick visual representation of each of your garden's measurements. Click any quadrant -- or the temperature underneath -- to open up more detailed measurements.

All five specific pages give assessments and recommendations at the top, beneath current readings. For example, you might see that your moisture level assessed as ""a bit dry"" resulting in a recommendation beneath the assessment that ""Your soil's feeling dry. Make sure you water in the next 3 days.""

At the bottom of a measurement screen, you can find the data charted over time, followed by weekly averages. The long-term charts aren't specific. You can switch the scope so the data spans a day, a week or a month, but you can't scroll or zoom on any of them, and you won't be able to see the exact numbers behind the data points.

Your moisture readings will be plotted as a line graph. The rest of the measurements use vertical bars to represent the data instead of a single line. Neither actually show what the plotted numbers are, so you'll have to guess based on their relative position between the given upper and lower limits of the graphs.

If you're trying to gather data from your garden over time, you'll need a different device other than the Edyn Garden Sensor. The $60  Parrot Flower Power  does this quite well.

The rest of Edyn's app follows a similar pattern to what I experienced when looking at the measurements. It all looks great and functions smoothly at first, but the more I dove into the various features, the more I discovered annoyances and spots where I wished the app did more.

To get recommendations on when to water and fertilize, you'll want to add plants to Edyn's digital garden to match the ones you have in your real garden. Supposedly, Edyn has over 5,000 plants to choose from in its database with more being added all the time based on user requests.

That's a fine number that stacks up well against the competition, but the database lacks the nice touch added by  Koubachi's Plant Finder , which guides you through a series of questions to figure out what your plant is if you don't know.

You can search Edyn's database for your plant name if you know it. You can also search the database based on plant type and the plant's relative difficulty on a scale of 1 to 5, but if you don't know what type of plant you're dealing with, Edyn can't help you the way Koubachi's app can.

Once you find your plant, Edyn will show you a picture, the difficulty rating, and how much light, humidity, nutrition, and water the plant will need in the general terms of high, medium, or low. You'll also see the plant's ideal temperature range and a description under the plant's ""overview."" Click on the ""planting"" tab and you'll find specific tips, as well as advice about when and how to plant.

Click ""add"" and you'll specify if you're starting with seeds or a starter plant, with no option for an already full grown plant. Though once you answer that first question, the next one asks you for a start date, and you can pick one from the past.

Not that specifying the date will change anything once you've added your plant to your garden. In fact, the detailed information Edyn provides in the database seems to have little if any effect on the supposedly ""tailored"" recommendations provided for your garden.

I did most of my testing on a potted majesty palm, but since I couldn't find majesty palm in the database, I told Edyn it was a windmill palm. According to the database, the windmill palm has a difficulty rank of 2; it needs high light, high humidity, high nutrition and medium water.

Once I added the windmill palm, I checked the thresholds given for each criterion. It showed a moisture range of 10 percent to 40 percent, humidity and temperature ranges of 18 to 72 percent and degrees Fahrenheit respectively (about -8 to 22 degrees Celsius), and a light range of 8,000 to 32,000 lux. The nutrition range is given broader terms  -- the bottom of the chart is marked ""depleted"" the top is labeled ""too much.""

Using the listed thresholds, Edyn does an admirable job of being as specific as possible with its recommendations. When my light readings were low, it told me to find a sunnier spot or supplement with grow lights. You might not know how much water to give your plant exactly, but you have a range you can aim for and specific instructions to help.

At least, I thought it was the range meant for my specific plant. Later in my testing, I removed the windmill palm from my database, and added a marsh horsetail. The horsetail had a high water rating, but the optimal range listed by the chart was still 10 percent to 40 percent. The other four measurement ranges stayed the same as well. The database even lists the optimal temperature range of the marsh horsetail as 15 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (-9 to 18 Celsius), but the chart kept the upper and lower boundaries at 18 to 72.

I did the same test with oregano, a low-water plant, to the same results. As it turns out, according to a company representative, the thresholds given in the chart aren't meant to be the ideal range for your plant, just generic labels that aren't dynamic. But without specificity and without dynamic customization, the graphs are confusing, misleading, and much less helpful than they could have been.

The page listing your specific plants isn't much better. Once you've added a plant or two to your personal database, you can switch from the main app page to a plant tab to see your personal garden. Your plant's status will be listed as ""sprouting."" It doesn't matter when you said you initially planted it, it will always be listed as ""sprouting"" for the first several days, then will update to ""mid-season"" at a seemingly predetermined time unrelated to how your actual plant is doing.

Tap a plant name, and you'll get a few tips for maintaining them, but not the detailed information from the database. If you want to see that again, you have to go back into the database and search for your plant species again.

Allowing you some sort of input or means of notetaking here could have gone a long way. Not showing the detailed info on your garden page, and not using plant specific information to frame the collected data are both odd oversights that hinder the usefulness of Edyn's plant database. It won't allow you to track actual progress. You can't see any helpful information on your plants once they're added, and they don't affect the thresholds framing the data.

To top it off, the app has lots of other smaller annoyances that stack up as you use it. It's frequently unresponsive, and the screen shakes as it updates. When you open the app for the first time in a while, you'll also need to wait before you can press any buttons, as none of them will work while the data updates.

Moving the sensor to a new Wi-Fi network requires adding a new sensor to your database, you can't simply change the network of your existing sensor, you'll need to create a whole new digital profile. You'll double tap the button on the base to restart sync mode, but you won't find that info anywhere in the instruction manual. The instruction manual even directs you to a dead support page. Here's the real one if you have an Edyn sensor and need help.

On one occasion, after hitting the button twice, I couldn't get the app to work at all for days. According to a company representative, it was an isolated incident that only affected a few people, and was caused by a bug in the code of one of the plants I added to my garden. Crashes can happen to any app, but among all the rest of the software issues, this glitch struck a nerve.

To his credit, Edyn's founder, Jason Aramburu, responds to a lot of user questions and concerns on the support page himself. He seems dedicated to helping his clients and giving them the best experience he can.

The apps are also being continually updated. The Android app, when I first started testing Edyn, was barely functional, but it's now mostly finished. Push notifications were just added, though they're limited to moisture readings for now. That's intentional, as moisture tends to be the most time sensitive plant care aspect.

Someday, Edyn could be great. And outward signs show the company is still dedicated to that cause. Still, it hit retail with an unfinished app on one of the major platforms, and a number of problems that still haven't been fixed. Edyn's app wasn't ready for the public, it still isn't, and for a smart device, that's tough to forgive.

Edyn's app falls well short of the wonderful Koubachi app. With Koubachi, you can move the plant sensor to different spots of your garden. It learns the moisture patterns of the area, forms recommendations, then you can move it somewhere else while it still keeps track of when you need to water the old area.

Even  PlantLink 's system, which only monitors moisture, lets you put a name for your plants in the database to give them personality and develops a watering calendar for you. It also updates its data and reacts to changes quickly. PlantLink is simple, but it makes better use of its software than Edyn.

For the time being, Edyn also gets beat by the competition in terms of interoperability. Both Parrot and Koubachi can talk to the  GreenIQ  sprinkler system. Soon, Edyn will release it's own water valve to the same effect. Given the app's difficulty with communication, though, I'm glad it's not here now.

Again, though, the hardware is fine, and that includes the sensors themselves, which proved accurate over the course of our two week tests. We placed Edyn in a pot with a majesty palm, next to calibrated meters to determine its accuracy across all five criteria.

As you can see, the two sensors started off with distinctly different moisture readings. I placed them close to each other in the soil, but my Majesty Palm was newly potted and it's completely understandable that two different spots in unsettled soil read different levels of moisture. As the soil settled, you can see the graphs getting closer and closer together until they spent days overlapping exactly.

The only concerning part of this graph was on the 22nd. As noted, I watered and fertilized, and Edyn didn't pick it up. I even waited a few hours after I watered to take a reading, and Edyn's moisture levels stayed unmoved. When I watered and fertilized on the 24th, with twice as much water, Edyn got right back on track, but it's again sometimes slow to react and not in tune to small changes. Even on the 24th, the recommendations still told me to water for hours after the number had adjusted.

Edyn's temperature readings didn't miss a beat, staying within an acceptable margin of error for the entire two week test. It even kept up with the temperature spike when I took my potted plant outside into the summer heat for a day.

The humidity readings don't show quite the same impressive consistency, but still stayed within an acceptable margin of error throughout the tests.

Since Edyn doesn't give any number for soil nutrition, just a general value on a graph between depleted and too much, I looked for patterns in the data to determine its accuracy. Similar to the moisture readings, the values looked good, but missed the watering and fertilizing on the 22nd.

Nutrition's measured in soil conductivity, so it's susceptible to overestimating how much fertilizer is present after you water. I watered the palm without fertilizer after the end of the official tests. Before I watered, the graph sat approximately 55 percent of the way up between depleted and too much. The next morning, it was all the way up to 100 percent too much nutrition, and I didn't add any fertilizer

The Parrot Flower Power -- the only other smart plant sensor to measure nutrition -- used the same method and had similar issues. Edyn's nutrition values seem accurate most of the time, but give it time to adjust its readings after you water.

Edyn's light readings didn't seem accurate at all. It shows a 24-hour average as the listed value, and only gives current data in the graph as a relative position between 8,000 and 32,000. You have to do some guesswork to get a current value, but the value I parsed from the graph was significantly off from our calibrated light meter.

A bright interior setting should be between 600 and 800 lux, that's the value our meter gave when I took readings, but Edyn placed the light around 12,000 lux or more. When I took my majesty palm outside, Edyn's readings spiked up to 32,000 lux, but direct sunlight should be significantly more than that, and the calibrated meter showed readings of over 60,000 lux.

It looks like Edyn smoothes over the data to approximate its numbers. Nonetheless, the recommendations seemed accurate, if slow as usual. Edyn would tell me to find a sunnier spot for my plant if it was in a shaded corner of the office for a few days -- a good call.

When I took it outside, into direct sunlight, it still recommended I find more light. That's the downside of smoothing the data and providing recommendations based on 24-hour averages -- if you fix the problem, you'll have to wait awhile to get confirmation and you might over adjust by mistake. The day after I left it outside for a while, even though it was back in the same shady indoor spot, Edyn told me to shade my plant.

It took three different meters to verify Edyn's accuracy, so it could certainly be a useful tool once its app gets fixed. Nutrition and light both show skewed numbers, but they smooth out their data over time, and the recommendations should prove solid as long as you wait for averages to process. The rest performed accurately. In general, I found Edyn's data performance acceptable and sometimes good, you'll just need to have enough patience to wait for it to process new info, as across the board, it's slow.

Since it takes patience to use this device anyway, I recommend you stay patient and hold off for now if you want it. The company needs to prove it can get the app right before I'd call Edyn worth the $100 cost. The app has been updating throughout my testing process, both for better and for worse as it's added push notifications and gotten the Android app up and running, but caused my app to freeze for a few days in the middle of my tests. It simply isn't finished yet.

Lots of apps update once they hit the market, but this one feels like it's still in beta. If you want a connected garden device, I recommend either the  Koubachi Wi-Fi Sensor , and its awesome app, or  PlantLink  and its simple but charming interface. Slow readings, a handcuffed database, and occasional unresponsiveness render the Edyn Garden Sensor much less useful than it should be. Edyn could still be the best garden sensor out there, someday, but for now, it's a smart device with a bad app, so I don't recommend it for your own garden paradise."
A roving robot Buddy to watch over your home|"

I'm a bit torn when it comes to ""The Jetsons'"" vision of the future. Flying cars? Count me in. But Rosie, the family's omnipresent robot housekeeper is kind of...meddlesome. I mean, do we really want autonomous busybodies taking control of our homes?

If Paris-based startup Blue Frog Robotics' Indiegogo campaign for Buddy -- a ""companion robot"" designed to help you out with everything from basic reminders to security and even smart gadget control -- is any indication, we really, really do.

With just hours to go on the Buddy crowdfunding project, backers have contributed over $400,000/£255,000/AU$550,000 toward the promise of a real-life Rosie (well exceeding Blue Frog Robotics' original $100,000 goal).

Weighing in at 11 pounds (5kg) and just shy of 2 feet tall (56cm), Buddy has built-in motorized wheels designed to travel roughly 2 feet per second. And it's supposed to operate autonomously, moving from room to room with a battery life expectancy of up to 10 hours. The team also offers a docking station (sold separately) if you want Buddy to automatically return to a charging base.

Outfitted with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tech, Buddy is supposed to be able to tackle all sorts of tasks. It can keep track of your agenda, wake you up in the morning, and act as a teleconferencing portal, a video- and music-streaming device and a home security sentry (via built-in camera).

It's also supposed to work with third-party smart home products like  Parrot Flower Power ,  Nest Learning Thermostat ,  Nest Protect ,  Netatmo Weather Station ,  MyFox Smart Home Security System , Lifx LEDs and others. Companion mobile apps will be available for Android, iOS and Windows users, and Buddy was built on an open platform so developers can get in on the action, too.

We haven't seen anything quite like Buddy before, although the concept of household robots isn't new. (Blue Frog Robotics co-founder, Rodolphe Hasselvander, hails from the CRIIF Robotics Lab, so this team has some experience in the field.) Still, these types of devices are only just entering the retail realm and even at a discounted Indiegogo rate, Buddy robots don't come cheap.

Early backers were able to snatch up units for a cool $500, but that price tier has since sold out. Now you'll have to offer up at least $650/£415/AU$890 to get one of your own (and that doesn't include the automatic docking station -- sold separately for an additional $150/£95/AU$205). Blue Frog Robotics plans to begin delivery of Buddy robots in December, and they are available to ship worldwide."
Upgrade your abode with smart-home gadget Branto|"

Startup Branto is in the middle of an Indiegogo campaign for a smart-home device of the same name. Branto is a neat-looking LED-illuminated sphere with a pretty lofty goal: to take on all of your home security and automation needs. At $279/£180/AU$375 a pop, Branto units aren't cheap, but there seems to be a lot of functionality tucked inside each crystal-ball-esque orb.

For starters, Branto supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and Global System for Mobile Communications (commonly shortened to GSM). That's partly so you can tap into core features, like its built-in 100-degree 1080p camera with 360-degree pan, complete with motion and sound alerts, two-way talk, night vision and local storage (thanks to an included 16GB internal memory card; cloud storage is elective), as well as audio streaming, video conferencing and an optional door/window sensor accessory, dubbed Branto Bit.

But supposedly, it's also so you can connect your Branto with third-party devices like  Nest thermostats ,  Philips Hue LEDs  and assorted  Belkin WeMo  products. That makes this connected-home gadget a unique hybrid that's half hub and half standalone security and automation device.

Not only that, but Branto is outfitted with a rechargeable battery and an optional cellular data connection (via GSM). That means that it should work even if you lose your Wi-Fi connection or power altogether. In fact, it is designed to go on the road with you as needed -- the 3,000mAh battery is supposed to last from 3 to 12 hours depending on usage.

Even with all of these options, Branto still seems expensive. That's especially true since hub-style products have been falling out of favor lately. That whole ""universal app"" thing is a solid concept, but it hasn't exactly  translated to a superior user experience when you consider products like the  Wink hub . We'll have to wait and see if Branto's Android and iOS apps actually deliver or if it's just more of the same.

Branto has raised over $47,000 so far -- that's less than $3,000 away from its $50,000 goal -- and has 20 days left on its campaign. Units cost $279/£180/AU$375 each, shipping is free in the United States, Canada and China (it costs an additional $30/£20/AU$40 to ship to other countries) and delivery is slated for December. Visit the Branto Indiegogo page for more details."
SunPort promises solar power sans panels (sort of)|"



Solar power has a lot of obvious appeal, but unless you're willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars outfitting your roof with solar panels, it isn't terribly accessible. A $49 gadget called SunPort currently making the rounds on Kickstarter wants to help. Plug it in and plug something else in behind it, and SunPort will track its energy usage, then automatically ""upgrade"" that energy to solar power by way of renewable energy certificates.

These solar certificates, or ""S-RECs"" have been around for decades. One gets produced for each megawatt-hour of solar energy that goes into the US power grid. Energy users can then purchase those S-RECs through their utility provider, each one certifying that one mWh of their energy consumption came from solar power.

The problem is that each S-REC is a pretty big chunk of power -- more than most homes use in an entire month. That makes them the right size for the companies and institutions that typically end up purchasing them, but too large for the average consumer.

That's where SunPort comes in. As it tracks the energy usage of whatever you've got plugged into it, SunPort's team will work with a nonprofit called ReChoice to purchase those S-RECs and break them down into smaller bits they call ""SunJoules,"" then apply that solar credit to your power consumption. To be clear, that won't lower your energy bill, but SunPort hopes it will help generate new demand for solar energy at the consumer level.

""It's a small, relatively easy step that can start to tip the balance,"" explains engineer, solar entrepreneur and SunPort creator Paul Droege. ""If we can just sort of step on the gas by causing more demand, it hastens the time until we actually have a dominant renewable energy grid, instead of the grid we've got today that's about seven eighths non-renewable.""

It's not just demand that SunPort is looking to boost, either. For each dollar ReChoice spends purchasing S-RECs, it commits a matching dollar to the installation of new solar panels through a solar endowment program. That means that using a SunPort in your home will help contribute to the solar supply, too.

There's a small certification cost that comes with each S-REC sale, but SunPort will cover those costs for the first year of use, with no limits. After that, users will need to pay a flat $20-per-year fee to continue claiming those SunJoules. Other than that, there are no additional costs or commitments associated with SunPort.

As SunPort tracks your energy usage, you'll be able to follow along on your Android or iOS device. The app can track multiple SunPorts at once -- down the road, SunPort's team wants to expand the hardware to include whole-home energy tracking, along with an enhanced plug that features automation and USB charging capabilities. Licensing the technology directly into electronic devices and appliances is a possibility, too.

""Five years ago, sitting at a solar conference, a speaker asked how many of us used solar,"" Droege told me, explaining where the idea for SunPort came from. ""A few dozen hands went up in a room full of thousands. That was the 'a-ha' moment. You know, there has to be a more accessible way to do this, if even industry insiders are this challenged.""

It remains to be seen whether the idea catches on or not. As of writing this, the SunPort's Kickstarter campaign has raised $44,352. It'll need to hit a goal of $75,000 by August 27 in order to receive funds and start production, with SunPorts projected to ship to backers in March of next year."
Mist sprinklers use forecasts and sensors to up the volume on smarts|"

The Mist Sprinkler System will do its best to keep your yard thriving, even in a drought. By using readings from solar-powered moisture sensors you place throughout your yard combined with information from local weather forecasts, the Mist Sprinkler Controller will supposedly give your plants just the right amount of water they need.

The system should save you money on your water bill under all conditions, and in a drought, it can automatically provide the minimum moisture necessary to keep your garden green until conditions improve.

The main piece of the Mist system is the $150 Mist Controller. It replaces your existing controller for an in-ground sprinkler system and can support up to 16 zones. It connects to Wi-Fi and determines when to water autonomously, based on weather reports it gathers from the cloud and moisture readings from the other piece of the system.

That other piece is the Mist Sensor. A $50 add-on to the Controller, you'll place the plastic-encased, weatherproof sensor into the soil of your yard or garden. From there, it collects information on moisture, ambient light and temperature, then sends that data to the Controller.

The Mist Sensor runs on rechargeable solar-powered batteries that are touted to last up to 10 years. It also detects when it's raining or freezing and will stop your sprinklers from running in either case.

Mist Labs, the California-based startup behind the Mist system, claims it can reduce your water bills by up to 50 percent. Mist will only run the sprinklers in short bursts, to let the water sink in and so that the sensors can update their readings before continuing, if necessary. In drought mode, it'll run in shorter bursts and only target zones with vulnerable plants.

It's unclear how Mist will know which plants are vulnerable. You'll be able to control the sprinklers yourself, if you choose, and customize days and times for watering from Mist's iOS and Android app. Perhaps that app will have a plant database you can use to help keep the system informed about the needs of your yard.

Both of Mist's main devices, the smart sprinkler controller and the smart garden sensor, will have plenty of competition when they hit the market, though Mist Labs will be the first company to offer both in a single system.

Other smart sprinkler controllers include the  Rachio Iro ,  Blossom , and  GreenIQ . All replace your in-ground sprinkler controller and use weather reports to help you plan your watering schedule more efficiently. Both Rachio and GreenIQ have channels on  IFTTT -- an online smart-home automation platform -- allowing you to customize rules to set up watering schedules based on input from other devices. For instance, you can use the  Parrot Flower Power , a smart-garden sensor also compatible with IFTTT, to keep Rachio and GreenIQ informed.

The Flower Power, though, is limited to Bluetooth. GreenIQ also works with the  Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor  to the same effect. Another competitor, the  Edyn Garden Sensor , throws nutrition and humidity readings into the equation, along with the three parameters measured by Mist, and will talk to an upcoming Edyn Water Valve to control your hose-fed sprinklers.

You can pre-order Mist now via its Indiegogo campaign. You can find a few bundles and early-bird offers with discounts, but even the normal price seems reasonable if Mist works as promised. $150 for 16 zones stacks up well against Rachio ($300 for the 16 zone version), Blossom ($180 for 12 zones) and GreenIQ (6 zones for $250). Even the $50 sensor stacks up well against the $60 Parrot Flower Power, the $100 Edyn and the $130 Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor.

You'll still spend a lot if you want a sensor to monitor each zone, and both pieces will have to deliver responsive functionality to live up the promise of the system and actually be able to keep your lawn alive in a drought. As with any crowdfunded product, I'm wary, but the supposed functionality and the reasonable price at least make this a system worth watching. If all goes according to plan, and you do decide to pre-order, expect delivery in February of 2016."
Elgato Eve Room review:|"

As one of the first smart-home products to take advantage of Apple's HomeKit, I wish the Elgato Eve Room was a better communicator. In concept, it's cool, and  I noted when I saw it at CES that it can give Siri a sense of smell. In practice, it's a little white box that has one unique trick among its otherwise mundane skill set.

If you want an air quality sensor that can determine the number of volatile organic compounds in the air, while also measuring temperature and humidity, the Elgato Eve Room will do it, chart the numbers for all three criteria, and send the data to your Bluetooth enabled iOS device. Because it's accurate, I can see this device being useful for allergy sufferers, or those painting or doing construction to their home, trying to figure out if the room they've aired out is now safe to inhabit.

You'll pay $80 for this device to get those readings, but that actually isn't exorbitant for a VOC meter. Amongst the three criteria it measures, air quality is the one that helps the Eve Room stand out, but because the device doesn't have push notifications and because it only works with Bluetooth, none of its readings are as useful as they could be. Some of the Elgato Eve Room's limitations might work themselves out as HomeKit gains maturity as a platform. In the meantime, don't let me stop you if you have a specific use in mind for the Elgato Eve Room, but don't waste your money if you're just looking for a broadly applicable HomeKit sensor.

The name Elgato Eve encompasses a family of newly released sensors. Eve Room is the indoor module that measures temp, humidity, and air quality based on its measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in particles per million (ppm). Room costs $80 and is available now from Elgato Eve's website, Amazon, Best Buy and other online electronics dealers.

It's available overseas as well, and priced at €80 in Europe and £70 in the UK specifically. Readers in the UK can purchase the Elgato Eve Room from either the company's site or Amazon.co.uk. For Australia, the price is given in Euros, and converts to roughly AU$118.

The Eve sensors hit the market this summer and were one of the  first products available to be specifically designed for Apple's HomeKit -- a smart-home platform built in to  iOS 8  and designed to unify the functionality of a variety of third-party sensors under a single rule system. We've already tested the  Lutron Lighting Kit , but the rest of Siri's smart-home friends are rolling out slowly.

Once you get the Eve Room set up, you can use Siri to check on the temperature and humidity readings, though unfortunately not the air quality readings. The other members of the Eve family -- the Eve Weather, the Eve Door and Window and the Eve Energy -- also respond to Siri, though each function and device is sold separately. Elgato's goal was to allow customers to pick the smarts they needed without forcing them into paying for a package of devices. It's a nice thought, but I'm guessing more than a few customers would have appreciated a discount bundle in addition to the a la carte offerings.

If it weren't for Siri functionality, Elgato's system would be mostly mundane, as you can find almost the exact same functionality as its fleet of devices in a  dozen other smart home products. The only ability that stands above the crowd on its own merits is that VOC sensor in the Elgato Eve Room.

The Eve Room itself is a small white box, measuring about 3 inches by 3 inches on its front squared face with an inch of depth. It's white save for a green Eve logo on the bottom side of the front, and the Elgato name on the back panel that slides away to reveal the battery compartment. The Eve Room takes three AA batteries.

The Eve Weather has a slot on the back so you can stick it on a nail in the wall. It's a small add on and the only way to tell the two sensors apart. Aside from visual clarity, I'm not sure why Elgato left that hook off of the Eve Room, as it would have added to your placement options. As it stands, you'll need to find a solid surface for it.

You'll also find stickers with an eight-digit numerical code, both on the back panel, and the bottom of the device. You'll use that code for the simple setup process. You can download the Eve app on your iPhone or iPad. Make sure Bluetooth is turned on on your Apple device, then open the app and it'll start to look for Eve devices in range.

For me, the app found my device within moments. I entered the code, then picked the room where I wanted to place my sensor. This is part of HomeKit's organizational system. You can set up multiple homes, so you'll specify a name for your home as a whole, then pick a room as a separate bucket within your home. I placed the Eve Room in the Media Room (you have to select from a list) in the Land of Geb (as in Gebhart, since I got to name that one myself).

At that point, the Eve Room starts collecting data. You'll see info on temperature and humidity right away. Air Quality takes a few minutes before you'll get your first reading, and according to a company representative, it takes a few days to properly calibrate to a specific location for the reading to be accurate.

It's a bit of a disappointment that it's so slow, but I found it had a pretty good idea of the air quality within a few minutes -- the readings matched our expectations as we moved it from open air environments to smoke filled areas. So if you set the Eve Room down in a newly painted room, it might not know the exact ppm right away, but its estimate of whether or not the air quality is generally Excellent, Fair or Poor will be trustworthy.

More of a disappointment is the lack of options as far as actually doing something with the info it gives you. Right now, you can see the data when your device is in Bluetooth range. You can expand any of the three criteria to see the info charted over the course of hours, days, weeks or months.

Yet, you can't set warning thresholds to receive alerts or trigger any kind of push notification. The Elgato Eve Room certainly cannot be used as an emergency device. It can't even really be used as a hands-free way to automate your home based on the environment, since you can only get up-to-date readings when standing next to the device with the app open. It'll only run in the foreground.

By contrast, the  Netatmo Urban Weather Station  has an  IFTTT channel with 14 triggers for each of its measured criteria. The $180 package includes an outdoor and indoor sensor. The indoor module measures temp and humidity, like Elgato. It also measures the ppm of carbon dioxide, though not all VOCs. In addition to all that, Netatmo packed a noise sensor into the module as well.

Thanks to IFTTT, you can set up all manner of automation and notifications with Netatmo. If you want the thermostat to turn on when your kid's room gets too cold or a smart light bulb to flash red if the air quality gets past a warning threshold, you can set that up with Netatmo and IFTTT. Netatmo's also on the list of upcoming HomeKit compatible products, though Elgato has an advantage here since Netatmo's HomeKit specific model isn't available yet.

You can't even view the Eve Room's data remotely unless you have an  Apple TV . Without it, you need to be within Bluetooth range of your device to do anything. The Eve Room can store data for up to two weeks when you're not near it, then will update your readings and graphs when you get close again. Without an Apple TV, you'll need to pull up the Elgato app and let it refresh its reading for Siri to be helpful.

Again, you can ask Siri for temp and humidity readings, and by specifying the room name you picked when setting up your sensor, your iOS device will know to check those readings instead of looking up the local weather. For example, I asked, ""What's the temperature in the Media Room?"" If I'd updated my info recently by having the app open when close to the device, I'd get an answer specified to the tenth of a degree. If I hadn't updated the data recently, Siri would tell me she wasn't getting a response from my device.

With an Apple TV, your range of access extends exponentially, but the setup can be a pain and for now, you might not be able to use your existing iCloud account. I tried to use my personal iCloud account attached to my personal gmail and it didn't work. According to an Elgato representative, this is a known and common issue. Once we created a brand-new iCloud account linked to an iCloud.com email, we started to make progress. Even then, it took some troubleshooting and could require that you tinker with your iCloud Keychain and privacy settings.

With all the hoops you have to jump through -- buying an Apple TV if you don't have one, getting a new iCloud account, changing your settings -- accessing Elgato Eve remotely barely felt worth it, since you still can't do anything with the info. That said, it's a nice perk if you already have the necessary extras.

The data Elgato Eve collects is actually linked to your iCloud account, and that means Apple's team is helping to keep it secure and properly encrypted. It's a big benefit Elgato gains from jumping on board with HomeKit, but it also means more than one person won't be able to access the readings from your Eve Room, even if you want them to.

You won't be able to sync up the same data with Eve Room to multiple users and multiple devices. Even when we switched iCloud accounts on the same device to get remote access, we had to fully reset the Eve Room to get it to connect and lost the historical data.

Supposedly, a lot of the Elgato Eve's limitations could be fixed as HomeKit grows and expands in functionality.  iOS 9  will supposedly add both notifications and triggers as options for devices in its ecosystem. It should also allow easier remote access to HomeKit requiring only the iCloud. Elgato has even promised to enable guest access to your devices. The future holds a lot of promise for the Eve Room. Without all these upgrades, the present situation for the Elgato Eve Room is pretty disappointing.

As it stands, this smart device isn't very smart since it can't do anything with the info it gathers, but at least the info it gathers is accurate. The Elgato Eve Room is a capable multimeter even if I hesitate to call it a capable smart device.

To test the temperature and humidity readings of the Elgato Eve Room, we let it sit on a table in our office for a couple of days, so it could properly calibrate to the environment. Then, we took three readings a day for two weeks and compared them to readings from a calibrated Hanna Conductivity Meter for temperature, and a multimeter for humidity.

As you can see in the graph above, the ebbs and flows of Elgato Eve's temperature readings match those of the Hanna Meter. The numbers sit between 1 and 3 degrees apart, but that's within an acceptable margin of error, allowing for a small deviation in both devices.

The humidity readings look largely the same.

Again, the ebbs and flows match and the devices stayed within an acceptable range of deviation. You can trust the readings of the Elgato Eve Room.

I have a few nitpicks when it comes to navigating the charts themselves. The main page of the app shows all three current readings together. Press a stat, and a small chart drops down. To get to the full page chart for any given parameter, you'll need to double tap this small chart or press the ellipsis in its lower right corner. I thought it was a little counterintuitive. I would have liked a clearer way to get to this full chart, as I guessed a few different options before I found the right answer.

At the top left corner of the main app, you'll find a button taking you to a menu with your room and a list of the three parameters. Hitting ""Humidity"" from this menu should take you to the chart itself, but it's again just the single-line stat that drops down to the mini chart, leaving a lot of wasted screen room until you double-tap to unveil the full thing.

The full-size chart works well once you find it. Buttons at the bottom let you select hour, day, week or month to squeeze or expand your data as you see fit. You can scroll left to view older data on any chart, assuming your device has been running long enough to have this historical info. You can't pinch to zoom as you can on the Netatmo app, but I didn't miss that functionality often.

On the week and month views, Elgato makes the data a little confusing by splitting the readings into red and green lines, neither of which are labeled. I assume those lines are highs and lows over the compacted periods of time but some sort of key would have been nice.

The only significant knock I have on the performance -- on two occasions the data simply refused to update. Both times, I spent more than an hour trying to get a current reading. The app will tell you when the device is unreachable, and this wasn't the case. It just wouldn't refresh, and the Elgato app lacks a means for a manual refresh. Most of the time, going to the home screen and reopening the app, or closing it all the way and reopening it would force it to collect new data. On those two occasions, nothing I tried worked.

When I came back the next morning, both times, the Eve Room got right back on track as though nothing had happened. The update blips are probably another sign of a young app that hasn't reached its full potential yet, but it's something to be aware of if you do want to purchase this as a multimeter.

One of these freezes happened when we were putting the device through a bit of torture for the sake of testing the air quality sensor, but we kept it within the specified operational ranges at all times.

We built a box for the Elgato Eve Room so we could fill it with smoke and paint fumes and not cause our own lungs any harm. The Eve Room showed itself decently nimble at picking up the approximate air quality of a new location, right away. Again, according to the company, you'll want to leave it in one spot for a few days for super-accurate readings.

But when we put it in a box and lit a smoke candle, the ppm count on the Eve app climbed quite high, as you would expect, even without letting it sit in the box for days before we started. Elgato noted poor air quality during each smoke test and showed VOC readings with multiple thousands of ppm. For reference, the usual office environment had excellent air quality readings of 450 ppm, so these were appropriately way above the norm.

Interestingly, it didn't store these extremes in the long-term charts. The smoke cleared quickly and the Eve Room kept right up with it, showing excellent air again after just a few minutes. On the charts, Eve averaged the time around the smoke as the permanently stored data point. So even though I saw the air quality reach poor status and 2,000+ ppm, the history in the charts only shows it getting as bad as moderate air quality at 1,698 ppm.

It's odd that the Eve Room smooths the data like that. Again, don't use this as an emergency alert device. Not only will you not get any push notifications, but if you're not looking at the readings while the event is happening, you probably will never see how bad the air quality was at its peak. For longer term readings like determining the paint fumes in a room under construction, this data smoothing shouldn't be an issue.

My idea of a smart home is one that acts on your behalf. It should automate processes based on your preferences to make your life more convenient. In this sense, the Elgato Eve Room doesn't qualify as a smart home device. It doesn't automate anything on its own, and without push notifications or triggers enabled, it doesn't contribute its sensory data to automating anything else. It takes environmental readings accurately, but so do most standard multimeters.

$80 isn't a bad price for a multimeter, so if you have need of a VOC sensor that packs in temp and humidity readings and like the idea of it transmitting data to your iPad, go ahead and purchase the Elgato Eve Room. It works, and it should get significantly smarter over time as the Homekit smart home platform gets upgraded by Apple. For everyone else, I'd wait for those improvements to make sure they're implemented properly before making the investment in the Elgato Eve smart home ecosystem. The Elgato Eve Room will understand your environment, but lacks any means to apply that knowledge."
The Windows 10-powered CastleHub is a smart-home moonshot|"

For all its potential, the Internet of Things is still a confusing mish-mash of protocols, integrations and standards. The CastleHub from CastleOS wants to cut through the chaos by working with everything and helping all of your gadgets play nicely within a single smart-home interface.

If that sounds like a familiar pitch, it should. The CastleHub is just the latest of a seemingly endless number of wannabe smart-home control hubs, and with established options from names like  Wink ,  SmartThings , and  Staples Connect  already in hundreds of thousands of homes -- not to mention recent smart home efforts from tech titans Apple, Google and Amazon -- it has its work cut out for it.

The fact that it costs $500 (about £320 or AU$675, converted roughly) doesn't help, either. That's more than the combined costs of the Wink Hub, the SmartThings Hub, the Staples Connect Hub and the Amazon Echo smart speaker.

To help set itself apart (and justify the high cost of buying in), the CastleHub claims to be the first smart-home hub powered by Windows 10. Basically a spherical PC, the CastleHub boasts a 30GB solid-state hard drive, 2GB of RAM and support for all of your Windows apps, including streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. Along with managing your smart-home gadgets, the CastleHub promises to be your living room's master of multimedia, too, with support for playback on Plex, XBMC and MediaBrowser clients, and also voice-activated playback control with DirectTV receivers.

That voice-activation support extends elsewhere, most notably to  Microsoft Kinect , which the CastleHub puts to use as an external microphone for system control. The idea is that, using Kinect, you'll be able to control your smart home by saying things like, ""Computer, turn the heat up,"" or ""Computer, turn out the lights in the back bedroom."" CastleOS puts an emphasis on flexibility here, with the ability to create custom voice commands that run custom C# scripts. You can even rename the wake word.

All of that is aimed pretty clearly at advanced users who feel comfortable tinkering around with a system to that degree. CastleHub found success in a crowdfunding campaign this spring, so there's definitely a market for this thing, but I'm not sure that I see the mainstream appeal of a potential smart-home breakout. It's also worth noting that the similarly expensive  Revolv smart hub  failed to find enough customers despite a sizable marketing effort and prominent placement in big box retailers like Home Depot. It was eventually  acquired (and discontinued) by Google-owned Nest Labs.

In terms of product compatibility, the CastleHub promises support for popular brands like Nest, Belkin WeMo, Philips Hue, TCP, and Ecobee, along with support for protocols like Z-Wave, Zigbee, X-10 and Insteon. That support isn't built in, though, as the CastleHub only includes radios for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. For everything else, you'll either need to plug in an additional adapter via USB, or rely on a product-specific adapter, like the Philips Hue Bridge. That cuts somewhat against the idea of the simplified smart home setup that the CastleHub is aiming at.

You'll control everything with the CastleOS HTML 5 application, which is designed to run on all devices -- iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Fire Phone, Linux, you name it. Advanced users can open the hood and tweak the code to their liking, or build an entirely new user interface. There's also an open API (application program interface) for third-party developers to play with. Also interesting: the CastleHub isn't a cloud-based device. All of your settings are stored locally, within the Hub itself. The team behind the CastleHub touts that as an approach that's more private and more secure.

The CastleHub is open for preorders now at early-bird pricing that knocks the cost down to $429 (£275, AU$580). That's still one heck of an investment, but serious smart-home enthusiasts might be tempted nonetheless. Preorders are expected to ship out by the end of August, immediately after Kickstarter backers receive theirs."
iFamCare forges ahead with its Helmet security cam|"

iFamCare is a California-based startup that's diving head-first into home security with Helmet, a 1080p camera that's preorderable on Indiegogo for another six days.

Despite its silly name -- and very silly promotional video -- Helmet boasts some pretty neat features at an extremely reasonable price. (The $79 ""Early Supporters"" tier is already sold out, but you can still snag a unit for just $99/£50/AU$110).

The Wi-Fi-enabled iFamCare Helmet claims to have 1080p video quality, two-way talk, night vision, motion and sound sensors with accompanying alerts, an air quality sensor, 360-degree pan, 70-degree tilt, a microSD card slot, optional cloud storage, the ability to take photos and videos on demand and a built-in laser (for playing with your cat/dog/other pet from the companion Android or iOS app).

During a time when most camera companies emphasize privacy features for concerned customers, you also have the option to make your Helmet cam public. There's even a search function so you can find fellow Helmet owners in your area with similar interests. I'm not sure exactly how I feel about that, but at the very least they're taking a unique approach.

And as far as design goes, Helmet cams are available in white, black, gold or silver, so there's a finish to fit in with most decors.

That's a whole lot of functionality and options at about half the price of comparable models, like  Nest Cam ,  Samsung SmartCam HD Pro ,  Withings Home ,  Netatmo Welcome  and  Flir FX , although iFamCare doesn't make any mention of third-party integrations on its Indiegogo page.

With less than a week left on the Helmet campaign, iFamCare has already raised over $55,000 -- well exceeding its original $15,000 goal. Get a unit of your own with a minimum contribution of $99/£50/AU$110; units ship worldwide and are scheduled to reach backers in early 2016."
Move your old blinds into the connected future|"

With Teptron's Move, you'll be able to retrofit your existing window shades with a simple, Bluetooth-enabled motor. The spool in the device can supposedly fit almost any cord or bead chain. Stick it on the wall next to your window, insert the chain, and you can raise and lower your shades with your phone, set schedules, or program the shades to automatically raise or lower if it gets too bright or hot.

The concept behind automatic shades isn't new. QLink and  Somfy  showed off smart options last year at Denver's  CEDIA home tech show, and Serena offers customizable blinds compatible with  Lutron 's smart home system. Move, from Swedish tech startup Teptron, and available for pre-order via its Kickstarter campaign now, is the first to get around the expense of replacing your existing shades to make them smart.

You can order a single unit with a solar panel now for $29 and it'll ship anywhere in the world come February of 2016, assuming Teptron meets its fundraising goal. The $29 price is actually converted from Swedish Krona. For those in the UK and Australia, the single-unit price converts to approximately £18.55 and AU$39.64. You'll also find plenty of bundles on the Kickstarter page if you want to be ambitious and smarten up all of the window coverings in your home.

Each pack includes the Move itself, which is a small, white, rectangular panel with a motor and a Bluetooth antenna. It'll come with a wall mount and double-sided tape, so you can choose how to mount it. The pack will even include a small solar panel. Move can be powered by an AC adapter or four AAA batteries. Oddly, neither of those will be included in the pack, but if you spring for rechargeable batteries, you can use the solar panel to give Move self-sustaining power.

Installation looks simple enough. You'll place Move on the wall by the cord for your blinds, put that cord into the spool, and snap on the lid. Move will be compatible with both iOS and Android devices at launch, with a Windows app coming further down the line. It's Bluetooth only, so you won't be able to control your blinds remotely. But Teptron added a mesh protocol over the Bluetooth radio, allowing your shades to act as signal boosters for each other. Hopefully, you'll be able to control your upstairs blinds from downstairs via your Move sensors relaying the signal.

It won't work for you if you don't control your blinds with a cord, and you'll want to be mindful of the effect of sticking a white box on your wall in front of your shades if they're particularly stylish. I'm also not sure how it senses light and temperature, as none of the diagrams on the Kickstarter page show these meters.

That said, if the hardware and software development go as planned, Move will have found a simple answer to a complex problem, and being able to offer this functionality for a much more budget-friendly price than the competition could give Teptron a significant edge at launch."
Lumkani sniffs out fires before they start|"

South African startup Lumkani's aqua blue Fire Detector isn't your typical in-home alert device. Instead, this smart fire sensor was designed with a singular goal: ""To minimize the loss of life and property caused by fires in slums in South Africa and across the globe."" According to Lumkani, these settlements are typically constructed with flammable materials, neighbors live extremely close to one another and there's a widespread reliance on open flames for cooking, as well as lighting and heating homes.

Those factors present a real challenge, as fires under these conditions can travel especially fast, devastating whole communities with little to no warning. Lumkani says that there are 1.9 million such homes throughout South Africa.

Given that smoke-producing flames are a constant fixture in these towns, Lumkani's Fire Detector senses the rate of the rise in temperature rather than smoke. That's supposed to lower the potential for false alarms from cooking and other intended open-flame uses.

And if a detector does sense a potential problem, it can alert neighbors (who also have Lumkani Fire Detectors) within a 200-foot (60-meter) range via radio frequencies. (You have 20 seconds to contain the fire and disarm your alarm before devices in other homes issue alerts).

Lumkani also has plans for something it vaguely refers to as a ""smart device,"" a separate piece of hardware that's supposed to be able to send texts to homes and firefighters with the exact location of the flames.

While  smart smoke detectors  aren't a new thing, Lumkani's vision is pretty unique and has the potential to improve the way millions of people live both in South Africa and elsewhere. But, I could also see applications for this device in apartments, condos and any other structures where people are living in close proximity to one another.

There are only five days left on Lumkani's campaign and the team has more than doubled its original $45,000 funding goal. A pledge of at least $15 sends one of Lumkani's connected detectors to a family living in South Africa -- and a contribution of $20 (or more) means that you get one, too. Lumkani Fire Detectors are available internationally and shipping is slated for November."
Nest Protect (second generation) review:|"

Nest Labs apparently loves a good challenge. Its ability to transform boring, utilitarian household products into smart devices beautiful enough to make a design giant like  Yves Behar weep (I imagine) is an incredible feat.

And yet,  Nest's original Protect smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) detector  had a big problem. Its 'Wave' feature that literally let you turn off alarms with a gesture was deemed dangerously unreliable after it hit retail, leading to  a recall.

Now, a second-generation Protect has arrived and it's noticeably sleeker and smarter than its predecessor. With a slimmer profile, a new in-app ""silence"" button that allows you to turn off smoke and CO alarms remotely (the original Nest Protect doesn't currently support this feature) and integration with the  Nest Learning Thermostat ,  Nest Cam  and IFTTT, this $99/£89 detector is the best connected one we've seen yet. If you already have a first-gen Nest Protect, I'd skip this upgrade, but I strongly recommend the Protect 2.0 to first-time connected detector shoppers.

Many consumers will still happily settle for the $25 puck of white plastic that functions as the traditional smoke detector. Like its predecessor, the second-generation Nest Protect elevates the aesthetic of the standard issue detector, but its balances that appeal with a set of connected features that let you control the Protect remotely via your mobile device or your account on the Nest Web page.

As before, Nest nails the aesthetic upgrade, thanks to the Protect's white or black finish, square design with rounded edges, and a stainless-steel mesh cover that looks neat and gives smoke and CO a bunch of access points. You might not install it in a place at home where you will often get to admire its looks, but at least when you do, you'll appreciate seeing it.

A ring of colorful LEDs surround the central on-off button, alerting you to the Protect's current status. It goes blue during setup or testing mode, green when everything's fine, white as an optional nightlight that illuminates when you walk underneath it, yellow/orange to warn that there's a potential smoke or CO emergency and red when there's a real smoke or CO event.

You can use the second-gen Nest Protect even if you don't have Wi-Fi (or temporarily lose your Wi-Fi connection for some reason). Whether or not you have Wi-Fi, the Protect unit will issue a loud warning if it senses increasing smoke or CO levels (specifically, it will flash yellow/orange and say, ""Heads up. There's smoke/CO."") And, if there's an emergency,  it will flash red and say, ""Emergency, smoke/CO detected.""

The Protect will also test itself for low batteries or any other concerns regularly, communicate with any other Protects in the house (if one Protect alarm detects smoke, all of the Protects in the house sound) and display a faint white light when you walk underneath it in the dark -- presumably on your way to get a late night snack, a feature it calls Pathlight.

To allow for of all of this functionality, the Protect has built-in sensors to detect electrochemical CO, heat, humidity, occupancy and ambient light, as well as a microphone. Nest also upgraded its smoke sensor with a split-spectrum sensor that's exclusive to the Protect 2.0. This new sensor claims to be better at detecting both slow- and fast-burning fires, which, unfortunately, wasn't something that we could test directly.

With Wi-Fi, you can do a lot more, including naming your Nest Protect(s) hallway/basement/bedroom, etc., opting out of the Pathlight feature, receiving alerts and auto-updates to software, using the Nest Android or iOS mobile apps and Web app, pairing your Protect with the Nest Learning Thermostat, Nest Cam and select Dropcam models for advanced integrations and even accessing IFTTT for third-party automations with color-changing bulbs like those from Lifx and  Philips Hue .

I used an iPhone 6 Plus to set up my Nest Protect. Since I already had the Nest app, I simply opened the app, selected ""Add product"" and followed the simple steps to start testing out the full functionality of the unit.

Given that the Protect has to be installed near your ceiling, it might take you a little longer than a typical plug-and-play smart-home device.  I opted for a battery-powered model so I could test it in different locations; it comes with six Energizer Ultimate Lithium (L91) AA batteries. Installing the hard-wired version yourself (also $99), will also require a basic comfort level with home electrical systems. For the initial setup, it took me about 10 minutes from start to finish. As always, consult a professional if you have any installation questions or concerns.

The screenshots above illustrate the basic setup process -- remove the tab from the battery compartment, add your Wi-Fi information, opt in or out of the Pathlight/nightlight feature and you're basically done, aside from a prompt at the end for a quick safety check. That check consists of pressing the center button on the Protect twice to ensure that it's connected to the network and functioning properly.

Navigating the Nest app is pretty straightforward, but it has some quirks. From the main screen you can initiate a safety check whenever you like to ensure that the alarms are working (you can also do this by pressing the center button on the Protect twice, as I mentioned earlier) and, supposedly, review your history. But, although I've tested the Protect over several days, no history has ever populated in the app. Instead it says, ""Welcome to Nest Protect History. Come back tomorrow to see what your Nest Protect has been up to."" Hm.

The second-generation Nest Protect is certified by Underwriters Laboratories under UL code 217 and follows safety standards outlined by the National Fire Protection Association under NFPA code 72. While we didn't have a safe way to test the Protect's carbon monoxide sensor, we did expose the unit to a fair amount of smoke from both bottled smoke and smoke candles. I also tested it alongside a $50 Kidde smoke and CO detector.

Although it was impossible to control the smoke dissipation perfectly, we conducted several tests and made every effort to expose both the Protect and the Kidde detectors equally -- and the Kidde detector almost always sounded its alarm before the Protect. The Protect starts with a spoken warning before launching into a full-blown alarm, which usually took place around the same time as the Kidde alarm's regular alert, but never before. The Protect's actual siren-blaring alert always started shortly after the warning. Usually, the Protect's alarm was just a second or two behind the Kidde, but it did take what'd I'd consider to be significantly longer (up to 15 seconds longer) a couple of times. Generally, though, the Protect and the Kidde took about the same amount of time to sound their respective alarms.

I did receive alerts on my phone from the Protect, but they weren't always timely; I consistently heard the alarm several seconds to a few minutes before I ever got a notification on my phone. Occasionally, I even received a number of alerts -- a warning alert, an alarm silenced alert and an alert that the smoke had cleared -- all at once and quite long (up to a few minutes) after the initial warning was actually triggered by the Protect unit, as you can see in the screenshot below. Notification response times will always be subject to network latency and the strength of your various wireless and cellular connections. I didn't see enough unreliability here to feel overly concerned, especially given that the more crucial local alarm works as expected.

The in-app silencing feature worked quite well and is a excellent alternative to blindly stabbing at your detector with a broom, but the Protect will override this feature if it decides that there's too much smoke in the area. I like that personally, but it will limit your ability to silence your Protect from the app. In addition, I tested Nest's claims that the Protect won't sound the alarm for something like steam coming from a shower. It worked flawlessly, correctly judging the difference between steam and smoke, although so did the Kidde detector.

I also tested an automatic integration between Nest Protect and Nest Cam users. If you happen to have a Nest Cam or a Dropcam and a Protect, the camera will automatically record during a smoke or CO event and shoot you an email with a link to the footage. This feature worked quite well and makes a lot of sense if you want to try to revisit what happened, but it's only useful if your camera is positioned somewhere near the action.

I also tried a few different IFTTT recipes with Lifx and Philips Hue LEDs (to flash red during a smoke event) as well as triggering the free Web and mobile service to call my cell phone whenever it detected smoke. The light bulb integrations weren't responsive enough for short smoke events, typically flashing several minutes after our test smoke dissipated. But I did like the phone call integration, which was prompt and provided a prerecorded audio version of the push alerts.

The $99/£89 second-generation Nest Protect is a solid smoke and CO detector. It looks great and delivers on the basics -- and then some thanks to its connectedness, especially its silencing feature (the first generation Nest Protect does not currently support in-app silencing). Your home wireless network and your cellular service will always have an impact on the reliability of those smarts. If they're not reliable, you shouldn't invest in those extras here, and generally, this second-gen model doesn't add quite enough to justify upgrading from the original to the 2.0 version today (unless you really want in-app silencing).

And while its in-app history section wasn't working properly, overall my experience with this new Nest Protect was a positive one. You won't find another smoke and CO detector available today that matches the Protect in terms of design and smarts."
Myfox Smart Home Security System review:|"

There are a lot of justifiable reasons to drop nearly $500 on a single purchase, but value is a pretty universal prerequisite -- is this worth it? While the answer to that question is often subjective, I can say confidently that the $478 Myfox Smart Home Security System (£418 in the UK), which comes with a 720p HD camera, a vibration-detecting door/window sensor and a 110-decibel siren is not.

The camera is pretty good (it costs $199/£169 a la carte), although the $150  Simplicam , the $199  Nest Cam  and the $279  Piper NV  in particular offer a lot more for the money. And the door/window sensor and siren kit ($279/£249 if you don't want the camera) is way too expensive when you consider what you're getting (a sensor and a siren...).. While I do like the design of these products and that they integrate with  'Works with Nest', the overall value just isn't there to recommend it to anyone.

The complete $478 Myfox Smart Home Security System includes a plug-in Wi-Fi hub with up to 6-hour battery backup (it was closer to 4-5 hours for me), a 110-decibel siren, a vibration-sensing ""IntelliTag"" door/window device, a key fob for smartphone-free arming and disarming (all battery-powered and radio-frequency-enabled) and a 720p HD Wi-Fi camera with 1-hour battery backup.

You do have the option of buying just the ""Home Alarm""  Wi-Fi hub, siren, door/window sensor and key fob kit for $279/£249 or just the security camera for $199/£169, although you need all of these accessories for the complete Myfox Smart Home Security System.

The various Myfox components look nice enough. Everything except for the door/window sensor has a coordinating rounded shape with a white finish and the occasional silver accent. While the aesthetics are unobtrusive and shouldn't cramp any home decor, the sheer number of accessories, their size and in some cases, even their shape strikes me as completely unnecessary at least and oddly limiting at most.

Take the siren. While this large disc-shaped device does have a built-in tamper sensor that sends an alert if it's moved, it's just a siren. A loud siren that's likely to scare away an intruder, yes, but just a siren. Then there's a separate hub, which seems like it could have easily been integrated into the siren or vice versa. And, although the camera's rounded design does blend in well with the other accessories, it spoils any potential for angling or rotating the field of view to achieve an optimal position.

All of these accessories also mean a more complicated setup process. Myfox offers an Android and iOS app so you can access these Wi-Fi-and radio-frequency-enabled products remotely. Download the app on your device of choice to get started. The app setup is mostly straightforward. It clearly identifies all of the steps, but there are many more steps than I would like.

Installing the Wi-Fi hub, which Myfox calls ""Link,"" was definitely the most complicated part of the entire configuration process. The first time I tried to set it up, I got a message that said ""An unexpected error occurred. Try again."" It worked the second time, but the hub was also difficult to reinstall when I moved locations.

Each time I switched to a different Wi-Fi network (I tested Myfox both at work and at home), I had to delete the accessories and start the configuration process all over again. That was pretty annoying, especially since DIY products are supposed to be designed for mobility.

After the hub was installed, the process flowed more smoothly to the siren, the door/window sensor, the key fob and the camera, which was the easiest to set up via a quick QR-code scan.

While the Myfox app looks pretty good, you really have to dig to find the information you're looking for -- it isn't intuitive at all and some of the features are similarly confusing.

For instance, you can adjust the sensitivity of the door/window sensor, but there's no in-app feature that lets you  adjust the motion settings to suit your needs, or even opt-in or -out of motion alerts. Everything is dependent on you scheduling or manually arming and disarming the system. And if the system is armed, you'll get motion alerts every time an event takes place, with no ability to set zones or change its sensitivity. If it's unarmed, you won't receive any.

Myfox also doesn't come with sound alerts, so there's no chance of getting an alert based on someone breaking a window, unless you have a door/window sensor attached to it.

To add to the confusion, if the system is armed and the door/window sensor is triggered, it will turn on the loud 110-decibel siren. However, if the camera's motion sensor detects activity, you simply get an alert instead of a triggered siren. There are also other features, like auto-disarming with the key fob that's supposed to deactivate the door/window sensor and the siren when it senses that you've arrive at home, but it never worked correctly for me.

I also got a lot of server-based error messages while using the app. ""Request failed: bad gateway (502)"" and ""Data unavailable"" were regular occurrences and made it very difficult to work inside the app.

That said, the system worked fairly well (when the app was functioning correctly). I received regular alerts, I was able to review motion-related clips and the door/window sensor really did a good job of differentiating between someone knocking on the door and aggressively shaking it (as in a forced entry).

Unlike  Piper NV ,  Flir FX  or  Foscam's FI9826P , Myfox doesn't offer free cloud storage. 1 day of continuous recording costs $5 a month and 7 days of continuous recording costs $10 a month. With so many fee-free services around -- and brands like  Nest Cam  even boosting their subscription from 7 to 10 days of continuous recording for $10 a month -- Myfox's fees are actually kind of steep.

Myfox is part of Nest's ""Works with Nest"" program, though. So I was able to successfully program my Myfox camera to turn off when my  Nest Learning Thermostat  was set to Away mode and back on when the thermostat was set to Home mode. That's a pretty limited feature, since you can already set the camera to turn off when you disarm the system and on again when you arm it, but third-party integrations are key in today's smart-home market.

Myfox also has its own IFTTT channel, but I ran into a problem here. Myfox is a French company and it has had products overseas for years. When I tried to create an IFTTT recipe, the Myfox API rejected my log-in information and gave me an error message in French. I reached out to Myfox about this issue, but haven't yet heard back from them. I'll update this review when I do.

Whether you look at the entire $478/£418 Myfox suite of products or its standalone components for $279/£249 (siren, sensor, hub, key fob) and $199/£169 (camera), this system is a bit of a jumble. Its features are limited, its app is confusing and occasionally glitchy and it's very expensive. If you're on the hunt for a simple DIY security camera with a built-in siren as well as motion, sound and a variety of other sensors, the $279  Piper NV  is a solid bet.  And, if you're looking for more door/window sensor-style accessories, something like  Viper Home  has a simpler setup and gets the job done for much less."
The color-changing iLumi smart LED heads back to Kickstarter|"

Two years after crowdfunding its first color-changing, Shark Tank-supported smart bulbs, iLumi is returning to Kickstarter with the debut of generation two. Simply dubbed ""The New Ilumi,"" the updated color-changers come in both a standard A19 form factor and a BR30 floodlight shape, and boast new features, new partnerships, and better hardware inside each bulb.

They also come with a fresh batch of limited early bird pricing specials, which should come as welcome news to anyone who's intrigued by the novelty of color-changing smart lighting, but put off by the traditionally high cost of buying in. Though they'll retail for $60 and $70 later this year, snappy Kickstarter backers can snag the A19 version for $29 and the BR30 for $35, with discounted bundles available, too.

That's some of the best pricing on color-changing smart lighting that I've seen. For comparison, a three-bulb  Philips Hue starter pack  costs $200, while the Wi-Fi-enabled  Lifx LED  sells for $100 per bulb. At thirty bucks a bulb (a little less than £20 in the UK, or roughly AU$40 in Australia), and with no bridge or control hub necessary, iLumi makes a lot more sense for anyone looking to deck their entire apartment out with color-changing light.

iLumi's bulbs communicate directly with one another (and with your iOS or Android device) via Bluetooth. Like the originals, you'll only need to screw the bulbs in, turn them on, and pair them with your device like any other Bluetooth accessory in order to start controlling and scheduling them. Generation two brings an upgraded mesh approach to that Bluetooth connectivity that promises to increase the range from 50 feet to 150 feet.

iLumi's also learning a few new tricks, including a dedicated setting to sync the lights up with the sun as its color tone shifts throughout the day, and another to sync color changes to the beat of whatever music you're listening to. You can also create your own customized sunrises and sunsets to help you fall asleep or lull you awake, or simply shake your phone to turn a light on or off. With flash memory packed into each bulb, you'll also be able to save a ""Power On"" state for each light -- a color and brightness that they'll default to whenever you flip the switch.

You can also set each bulb to turn on and off automatically when it detects your smartphone coming and going. If you can't decide what color ties the room together the best, just snap a picture -- iLumi's app will decide for you.

In addition to the new features, iLumi's team is promising new integrations, too. The two most notable are compatibility with the Google-owned  Nest Learning Thermostat  along with a dedicated channel on the online automation service IFTTT, both of which would put iLumi right on par with Philips Hue and Lifx. iLumi also plans to open its software to developers, paving the way for additional third-party integration.

The A19 version of the new bulb is designed to replace 60W bulbs, putting out 800 lumens from a respectable 10-watt power draw. iLumi promises a color rendering score of 82 at default, white light settings, along with fully saturated colors that are brighter than the competition's. We'll look forward to testing all of that out as soon as we get our hands on one.

As for the floodlight, it has a higher power draw at 15 watts -- but also promises more than 1,100 lumens worth of light.

An iLumi representative tells me that the first-gen bulbs will continue to be sold in the short term, but that the plan is eventually for generation two to replace them outright. If you've already bought in, don't worry -- the first gen bulbs will work alongside the new ones, and will receive all of the new features and integrations by way of an app overhaul due in November. As for the bulbs themselves, iLumi is promising quick turnaround, with a Kickstarter ship date set for September of this year."
Finally Light Bulb review:|"

The LED age disrupted the lighting aisle, but the Finally Light Bulb has its sights set on disrupting LEDs. Using induction tech that dates back to Nikola Tesla, the bulb offers an efficiency upgrade over incandescents, but promises patently better light quality than LEDs or CFLs.

The Finally Light Bulb team glowingly calls this approach ""acandescence,"" but given that it contains mercury, ""afluorescence"" might have been a better choice. Like many compact fluorescent lights, we found the Finally bulb to be less bright than advertised, and its lifespan and efficiency aren't as good as the common 60W replacement LEDs it's competing against. Unlike many of those competitors, the Finally bulb won't work with dimmer switches, either. What's more, virtually none of our tests supported the bulb's claims of superior light quality.

The killer is the price. At $10 each plus shipping, the Finally Light Bulb is priced unreasonably high for what it really is: a CFL that uses a different mechanic to move electricity into the bulb, where it can interact with fluorescent gas to produce light. Don't be fooled -- this isn't the bulb you've been waiting for.

The Finally Light Bulb was built by an impressive team of lighting industry veterans, including a former head of development and engineering for Sylvania and a former manager of lighting at GE's Research and Development Center. That's a lot of brainpower and several decades' worth of experience backing this bulb.

Inside of it, you'll find no filament and no diodes. Instead, the Finally light uses electromagnetism to induce an electric current within the bulb, an approach that dates all the way back to the 19th century. This electric current interacts with gasses in the bulb, including mercury, to produce light. Finally claims a light output of 800 lumens from a power draw of 14.5 watts -- not as efficient as most LEDs, but right on par with CFLs, if not slightly better.

Led by an entrepreneur named John Goscha, the Finally team saw demand for an incandescent look-alike, and built their bulb accordingly. Their marketing materials would have you believe that they're the only ones taking that approach (among other eyebrow-raisers), but that isn't the case. Shop around, and you'll find  plenty of LEDs and even some CFLs built to mimic the design and shape of classic incandescents, including many that look almost identical to the Finally design.

Turn the Finally bulb on and you'll see a warm, whitish-yellow glow that fades up to full brightness over the course of a few seconds -- a ""warm-up period"" that's similar to what you'll see with a lot of CFLs (check out the video at the top of the page for footage of what I'm talking about). Finally's engineers tell me that the warm-up period should shorten somewhat over the bulb's lifespan, but still, it undercuts Finally's claim that their product is an ""instant-on"" light bulb.

Something else the Finally bulb has in common with a lot of CFL bulbs is that it isn't dimmable -- a distinct disappointment given the $10 price tag. Options like the  Cree 4Flow LED  dim quite well and cost less.

Frightening flicker GIFs aside, the Finally Light Bulb delivers on its promise of incandescent familiarity -- at least on a basic level. To my naked eye, I couldn't see too much of a difference between its light quality and that of the classic, Edison-style light bulb it seeks to replace. I also appreciated the omnidirectional design, which does a very good job of evenly distributing light in all directions, including down. That makes the Finally bulb a perfectly good light to read under.

That last point is an important one. The way a light bulb looks when you turn it on isn't nearly as important as how it makes the surrounding environment look. To get a better understanding of the Finally bulb's true aesthetics, we needed to give it a good, close look in our test lab.

In a nutshell, a light bulb is just a device that converts electricity into light. Incandescents do it by using the electricity to heat up a tungsten filament until it glows. LEDs do it by powering semiconductor light-emitting diodes housed within the bulb. CFLs do it by exposing the electricity to gasses like mercury, europium and argon that emit light at various wavelengths on the visible light spectrum.

Graph these three approaches out over the visible light spectrum and you'll see three distinct results. Incandescents will show a steady slope that starts light on the ultraviolet end of the spectrum and then maxes out at the infrared end. This infrared light (anything to the right of that rainbow spectrum in the graph below) isn't visible -- it's heat. Unless you're using the bulb in an Easy Bake Oven, it's a waste of energy, and the main reason why incandescents are so inefficient.

Solid-state LEDs will typically slope up as well, but things peak at the yellow part of the spectrum before falling back down. With much less infrared light, the bulbs don't get quite as hot, but they also tend to look a little too yellowish and struggle to bring out red tones, as well.

The strangest graph of the three is the fluorescent graph. No smooth slopes here -- instead, you get jagged spikes, each one representing a specific gas that's interacting with the electric current in the bulb to produce light at a specific part of the spectrum. They also tend to peak at yellow, though you'll often see a lot of green, too. Without a continuous slope, you'll often also lose out on brightness.

The Finally Light Bulb most closely resembles the fluorescent graph, which isn't at all surprising given that it's essentially doing the same thing. Again, all of those jagged spikes represent the different gasses interacting with electricity and producing light at different parts of the spectrum. Finally's engineers told me that the induction approach gives them more flexibility with how they use these gasses, and the graph backs that up -- there's a greater variety of spikes at play.

If you haven't figured it out, what I'm getting at is that the Finally Light Bulb is, for all intents and purposes, a CFL. It's a compact bulb that uses fluorescent gas to produce light. It has mercury in it, meaning that you'll  need to be careful cleaning up after a broken one. Once it burns out, you'll need to take it to a recycling center (or drop it off at a retailer with a bulb recycling program).

And, like many CFLs, it isn't as bright as claimed. The surgical spikes in that graph come at a cost, as the gap in between each one represents a gap in light output. Sure enough, the Finally bulb clocked in at 589 lumens when we tested it out in our integrating sphere, well  beneath the claimed 800 lumens.

Its color rendering index score (CRI) leaves a lot to be desired, too. The CRI is sort of like a grade point average for colors. The higher the score, the better the bulb is at making colors look vivid and true.

Finally claims a CRI score of 83, but we measured it a little lower, at 78. That's better than most CFLs, which commonly score around 70, but not as good as most LEDs, which usually score at least 80. Some, like the  GE Reveal LED, the  Cree TW Series LED  and the  Ikea Ledare LED  -- which costs just $5 -- manage to do even better.

Those M&M pictures up above paint a pretty clear picture of what I'm talking about. Of the four bulbs shown, the Finally bulb looks the worst to me, and the farthest from what you'll get under a 60W incandescent. For a closer look, including similar pictures for a number of other bulbs, check out  our full gallery of CRI comparison pics.

There are still a few redeeming qualities at play with this bulb. As said earlier, it excels in directionality, with even light distribution from all angles. It's also not susceptible to heat buildup in the same way that a lot of LEDs are, which means it'd likely work well in an enclosed fixture, where heat can't escape.

There's also some redemption on the color quality front, specifically with regard to skin. Whereas the Finally bulb finished dead last in our M&M test, it was actually one of the frontrunners when we conducted a similar test using our hands as points of comparison. Only the incandescent bulb and the GE Reveal LED looked better, and only very slightly so.

If you take another look at that graph of the Finally bulb's light output, you'll see that one of the tallest spikes sits on the left, right above the purple part of the spectrum. I suspect that spike is at play with skin tones -- as CNET Appliances producer Tyler Lizenby smartly pointed out, photographers will often use magenta-tinted filters in order to help complement skin tones both light and dark in their photographs.

I'm also a fan of this bulb's 15,000-hour lifespan. Though not as good as the 25,000 hours you'll get from some LEDs, it's still almost twice as long as you'll see from the average CFL. The fact that Finally offers a 10-year warranty with the bulb -- 73 percent of its total lifespan -- is another strong point, and good reassurance for a bulb that doesn't have Energy Star double-checking the longevity claims.

In essence, the Finally Light Bulb is a long-lasting CFL with a good-looking design -- but with overstated brightness and color quality, it isn't a bulb I'd recommend. There are just too many shortcomings. It isn't dimmable. It isn't as bright as it should be. The light doesn't instantly reach full brightness when you turn it on.  It didn't pass our color-quality tests, or the eye test. It isn't as efficient as lower-priced LEDs. At $10 (plus shipping), it just doesn't add up."
Neurio Home Intelligence review:|"

Energy consumption isn't an easy thing to track -- and your electric meter and monthly bill definitely don't help the situation. They are full of confusing watt (W) and kilowatt-hour (kWh) readings that make little sense without a clear understanding of how each device in your home contributes to the whole.

The $249 (£160 in the UK at the current exchange rate) Neurio Home Intelligence device can act as your energy decoder. It provides real-time readings of the current power draw across your entire home, so flipping a light switch on and off shows an immediate shift in usage. You can also teach Neurio to distinguish among appliances for a closer look at how much your air conditioner or oven contribute to overall consumption. Unfortunately, that feature currently only works with devices over 400W and even then it regularly gets confused. Neurio also lacks any official third-party partners, despite its open platform. It also really isn't DIY -- the installation procedure is potentially very dangerous, and we highly recommend you bring in a professional to install it.

$249 is a lot to shell out for real-time energy stats, but Neurio does make it a lot easier than trying to translate your electric bill and it has promised to issue updates that should make it a more well-rounded product. But Neurio needs to hurry up --  Belkin  and startup  Ecoisme  have promised to deliver similar devices within the next year (that might be able to do even more). Hold off on Neurio for now if you want more than real-time readings.

Neurio is billed as a do-it-yourself device, something that is ""easy"" to install. I guess that could be true, if you are extremely comfortable with electrical work, but since most people aren't, I find fault with this designation. The installation requires a complete understanding of how to work safely with the breaker cover removed from your home circuit box. Since voltage remains live on the main breaker terminals (even after you've switched the main breaker off), anyone who has questions or concerns should defer to an experienced friend or hire a professional for this installation. A mistake here could could be fatal.

If you are familiar with this sort of work, this process shouldn't be too complicated. I enlisted Steve Conaway, one of our technical editors, to install Neurio. Here's a link to Neurio's installation guide if you're curious about the details, but it took Steve roughly 45 minutes from start to finish (and it probably would have taken him much less time if I wasn't constantly asking questions and stopping him to take pictures of the steps).

Keep in mind that once Neurio is installed, the device itself is completely hidden behind the main breaker cover. That makes Neurio's overall aesthetics pretty unimportant. It is a utilitarian device and I doubt that anyone would have issues with its design unless it doesn't fit the dimensions of the breaker box for some reason. But at 4.17 inches by 2.60 inches by 1.22 inches (106 mm by 66 mm by 31 mm), Neurio is pretty small.

After the Neurio installation, visit sensor.neur.io for configuration. Neurio does have Android and iOS mobile apps, but you'll need to get started on the Web app. On the Web app, you'll be asked to enter your email address and answer some basic questions about your breaker panel before connecting to your local Wi-Fi network. This process was very straightforward, although the setup interface looked a little dated.

Then I had immediate access to real-time energy readings on both the web and mobile app.

At first, I spent a lot of time walking around my house turning appliances on and off, amazed at Neurio's responsiveness. As far as real-time readings go, you can observe fluctuations from all of the products in your home -- flipping on on a fan or a light switch, cranking up the air conditioning, turning on the vacuum cleaner, baking something in the oven and so on.

Electric power in your home is measured by watts (W) and the energy that power uses is measured by kilowatt-hours (kWh).

You can watch the real-time monitor to see the current watts being used. The Neurio app will also estimate the average cost per hour of operating at that level.

The screenshot to the right shows the increase in power after turning on the vacuum. At 1,050W, my electric bill would cost an estimated 11 cents per hour.

These energy stats are definitely useful, but, unfortunately, that's Neurio's only reliable feature right now.

Neurio does have a ""train your appliances"" feature, which basically lets you select among various electronic devices in your home that use at least 400W or power. It can't currently differentiate between appliances below 400W, which include things like lights, computers, TVs and even some large appliances, like refrigerators. To see how much power devices under 400W use, your only recourse is to watch the real-time monitor closely.

This training feature is supposed to teach Neurio when certain appliances are on so that it automatically knows and can give you a more detailed summary of when your A/C is running versus your stove. To use it, select an appliance from the provided list or create your own. Make sure training mode is turned on, and then turn on your appliance. Once you turn it on, Neurio will pay attention to the power draw and log it, so that the next time watts within a similar range pop up, it assumes your using that same device.

There are a couple of problems with this approach, aside from the fact that it's limited to devices over 400W. If there are a lot of devices in use at the same time, Neurio has a hard time differentiating. And, if several devices use a similar amount of power, it will be tough for Neurio to tell the difference between them. For instance, my A/C unit and stove use power within a similar range, about 1,200-1,400W. Since those numbers can fluctuate -- and since they are already close to begin with -- Neurio tends to confuse my A/C unit and my stove.

Although Neurio is limited right now, it does have a lot of potential. The team plans to update it so that it can track devices under 400W and integrations with SmartThings and IFTTT are in the works. That should make it possible for Neurio to work alongside  Philips Hue LEDs , the  Nest Learning Thermostat  and  Belkin WeMo products , among others.

Neurio actually got its start on Kickstarter with a successful campaign that ended in November 2013. Since then, similar products have tried their luck on crowdfunding sites. Startup  Ecoisme  ended its Indiegogo campaign in June 2015 with plans to ship its first whole-home energy trackers in spring 2016. Unlike Neurio, Ecoisme should be able to detect unique identifiers between devices so that it not only knows the difference between a laptop and a fridge, but even between a Dell and a Mac laptop. Belkin's Echo technology, first  announced at CES 2015  sounds similar as well.

If you're looking for a detailed summary of each large appliance and small electric device in your home, the $249 (£160) Neurio is not the solution for you. The team did say that it is working on updates, but it's pretty limited  today. It also doesn't offer any official third-party integrations, despite its open platform.

Add on the fact that Belkin and startup Ecoisme are supposed to introduce similar products soon and Neurio will really need to step up its game to stay competitive. On the other hand, it's a solid option if you're simply in search of a functional real-time energy monitor."
Cree BR30 LED review:|"

""Don't buy in unless Cree catches up."" That's what I wrote last August when I reviewed the North Carolina lighting manufacturer's original LED floodlight. As BR30-shaped bulbs go, it was bright and efficient, but it was also a poor value compared to stronger alternatives like the  Philips SlimStyle BR30 LED , the  Green Creative BR30 Cloud LED , and the  Editors' Choice-winning GE Reveal BR30 LED . At $20 apiece, the Cree BR30 LED cost more than all of them.

Now, less than a year later, Cree's closing the gap with a new-and-improved second-gen model that sells for a much more reasonable $10 per bulb -- less than any of those other competitors. It still lags somewhat in terms of color quality, dimming performance, and heat management, but offers satisfying performance for general household lighting needs. If you've been waiting to upgrade a whole home's worth of floodlights, it's your most affordable big-name option, and a good choice, overall.

The Cree floodlight isn't anything radical as far as second-gen bulbs go. Though you'll spot a few tweaks to the design, it's still a glass bulb with a white plastic body, and a far cry from the redesign we saw with the Cree's all-plastic second-gen 60W replacement bulb,  the 4Flow LED .

The specs match up with last year's model, too. Both claim to put out 650 lumens' worth of brightness from a power draw of less than 10 watts: 9.5 watts for the original, and a slightly more efficient 9 watts for version two. Both will add a little over a dollar per year to your energy bill if used for three hours a day (for comparison, a 65-watt, 650-lumen incandescent BR30 bulb will add almost 8 bucks to your yearly power bill.)

Still, this isn't just the same bulb with a slightly different design. Crack them both open and peek under the hood, and you'll discover two entirely different approaches to distributing light. The original model sports a small metallic tower in the center, with ten light-emitting diodes circling the top like windows around the top floor of a skyscraper. The new model scraps this tower altogether, with the diodes peering up from the bottom of the bulb's interior.

You'll also notice that there's only two of them, each a bit bigger than the ten tiny ones in the original BR30 LED. They're more powerful and efficient, too. With a fifth of the diodes, the new bulb puts out more light from less power than last year's model. It adds up to incremental improvement in the end, but still, it's impressive engineering, and indicative of how Cree managed to get the cost down.

Both the original and the new version shine at a yellowy 2,700 K, with hotter, whiter ""Daylight"" versions that shine at 5,000 K available for an extra buck. Both promise to last 25,000 hours. Both are dimmable, both are Energy Star compliant, and both offer entry level color rendering scores right around the LED average of 80.

The only significant difference with this year's bulb -- aside from the price cut -- is that its warrant is not as strong as the original one. Like most of Cree's initial LED offerings, the original BR30 LED offered ten years of protection, but version two follows the company's recent trend away from that benchmark by offering five years of coverage.

Half the warranty at half the upfront cost seems like a fair trade to me, but customers who'd rather pay a little more for additional protection might be disappointed. Cree tells me that it won't be manufacturing last year's model any longer, and that once existing stock is sold off, it'll be gone for good.

That's a different approach than the company took with  its original, 10-year-warrantied 60W Replacement LED , which continues to sell alongside the shorter-warrantied 4Flow LED that followed it, offering you a choice between upfront savings and a longer warranty. You won't get that choice at the BR30 level.

Cree's new BR30 LED stacks up pretty well against its closest competitors. Testing each bulb out in our integrating sphere, Cree's floodlight came in at 699 lumens -- a slight bump in brightness from the stated 650 lumens, and brighter than what you'll get from the  Philips SlimStyle BR30 LED  or the  GE Reveal BR30 LED . It's slightly more efficient than those two, as well.

However, the  Green Creative BR30 Cloud LED  put up the best baseline numbers of all, scoring 734 lumens from a power draw of just 8 watts. It costs a few dollars more than Cree, but might be worth a look if you want the most efficient brightness for your buck (or if you're a fan of its odd, hollowed-out design).

The GE Reveal BR30 LED is also worthy of consideration due to its near flawless dimming capabilities, 10-year warranty, and impressive color rendering score, which helps it make colors look truer and more vivid. I liked it enough to award it our Editors' Choice, and still think it's the BR30 bulb I'd buy if I were upgrading, but now that the Cree floodlight only costs $10, I'd definitely have to think twice about it.

Like last year's bulb, the second-gen Cree BR30 LED promises to work with dimmer switches. Like all of the dimmable bulbs we review, I tested it out on a variety of dimmer switches, including newer models from Leviton and Lutron designed especially for LEDs, as well as an older knob-style Triac dimmer built for incandescents only.

The Cree LED did pretty well with all three, dimming as promised each time I tried dialing it down. Along with getting 100 percent brightness at the maximum setting, I was able to get the light the lowest on the rotary knob, clocking the minimum setting at just 7 lumens -- roughly 1 percent of the bulb's total light output. The range was a little tighter on the newer Leviton and Lutron models: roughly 95 percent brightness at the maximum settings and about 5 percent brightness when dialed all the way down. Your mileage definitely varies at least a little based on what hardware you're using.

The other big dimming concerns are flicker and buzz. Most dimmer switches cycle the power on and off at very fast rates in order to create the illusion of dialed-down light. This can create electromagnetic interference in the bulb, which can in turn cause tiny components to vibrate and buzz, and the light to flicker.

In the case of Cree's new floodlight, I didn't detect any buzz without my ear pressed against the bulb, and I barely noticed any flicker, either, except for some light wavering at low settings on the rotary dial. It's an altogether good result, and better than what we saw with the original Cree BR30 LED, but it's still not as impressive as the GE Reveal BR30 LED. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the GE bulb to flicker one bit.

Something else to think about when you're upgrading your light bulbs is whether or not you'll be using them in enclosed fixtures. Like most electronic devices, LEDs are vulnerable to excessive heat, which is why their designs typically place such an emphasis on heat sinks or convection vents. In an enclosed fixture, heat has nowhere else to go, so you'll want to be sure to pick a bulb that's especially good at keeping its cool.

The test results from our integrating sphere can help you do exactly that. All LEDs will see their brightness dip in the first thirty minutes or so of use as the heat builds up, then flatline at what manufacturers call a ""steady state"" once the bulb's heat sink or convection vents start kicking in. By the way, this steady state is where bulbs get rated for things like brightness and color temperature, so don't worry, you aren't getting short-changed on the specs.

With each bulb in the middle of our sphere, we can get accurate readings of how bright it is at any given moment. By graphing the bulb's brightness over an hour or so of use, we can take a look at where the steady state clocks in. As you can see in the graph above, the new Cree floodlight (the blue line) clocks in at 699 lumens, reaching its steady state in about 30 minutes.

That seems like a decent result -- and it is -- but it doesn't tell you the whole story about heat management. The important thing to look at is how not how bright each bulb is in this test, but how much brightness each bulb is losing. To do that, we need another graph, one that recalculates each lumen reading for each bulb as a percentage of how bright the bulb is at the start of the test.

Voila. Now, each bulb starts off at the same spot: 100 percent brightness. Five minutes in, four out of the five are down below 95 percent brightness, while one, the GE Reveal BR30 LED, is still up around 98 percent. At the end of the test, when the bulbs have all hit their steady states, only two are still above 90 percent: the GE Reveal bulb, and the Green Creative BR30 Cloud LED. If I needed a BR30 for an enclosed fixture, I'd be sure to go with one of those, because heat doesn't seem to affect them quite as much as the competition.

What's interesting here is that the two Cree bulbs mirrored each other so closely. Despite the new design and the new diode configuration, this is still largely the same bulb in terms of how well it manages heat. For basic usage, 87 percent is a perfectly fine result, and a subtle enough dip in brightness that you wouldn't notice it with your naked eye. For enclosed fixtures, though, I think you're better off sticking with LEDs that finish above 90 percent.

Cree's new floodlight is a tempting upgrade at just $10 per bulb, and I think it gets enough right to merit strong consideration. It offers more than enough brightness, strong efficiency numbers, and a satisfyingly warm quality of light. If you prefer something hotter and less yellowy, the Daylight version is probably worth the extra buck.

Still, the competition is strong enough to justify spending more in certain circumstances, and that keeps me from calling Cree's bulb a clear best buy. If you use dimmer switches or enclosed fixtures in your home, for instance, then the  GE Reveal BR30 LED  is almost certainly worth the extra cash. With top scores in brightness and efficiency, the  Green Creative BR30 Cloud LED  merits a look, too. But if you're just looking for a floodlighting upgrade that won't break the bank, Cree's new bulb offers the best value."
AllBe1 brings DIY home security back to the basics|"

During a time when multiaccessory kits and third-party integrations are dominating the DIY security market, Israel-based startup AllBe1 is trying something a bit different. It's streamlining home security with a single sensor-packed gizmo, available for worldwide preorder now on Indiegogo.

AllBe1's small flagship device, also called AllBe1, looks relatively unobtrusive (despite its range of color options, which include orange, yellow, white and black). It reminds me of a bright bauble that you'd stick on a keychain to distinguish your set of keys from the rest -- but there's a lot hiding behind AllBe1's basic exterior.

Like  Sense Mother , a sensor-based product that we reviewed last year, AllBe1 seems equipped to tackle a wide variety of security, environmental and heath-related home automations. Specifically, the AllBe1 team says that its multifunctional device comes complete with temperature, UV, ambient light, infrared, proximity and motion sensors.

Want to know if your kid leaves the front yard? Use AllBe1 as a proximity tracker. Are you always misplacing your laptop? AllBe1 can pinpoint its location. It can alert you when someone opens a door, a window or a drawer, it can count your steps, record distance, and even monitor the UV level in the area and alert you if you need step up your vitamin D intake.

AllBe1 is supposedly durable enough to handle outdoor use, comes with Android and iOS app compatibility as well as built-in Bluetooth 4.0 tech and operates via a rechargeable battery that's designed to last for up to 2 months on a single charge. And, it has a bunch of optional accessories, including a clip, a bracelet, a stand, a magnet and a necklace -- so you have more control over how and when you use your AllBe1.

AllBe1 is also open-platform, so developers can create apps to extend its overall functionality, although there's no mention of  IFTTT,  multiprotocol hubs  or other smart-home integrations, like  HomeKit  or  Brillo.

There are 16 days left on the campaign, but AllBe1 has already more than doubled its original $50,000 funding goal. The lowest price tier ($45 for one AllBe1, one stand, one clip and one necklace) is already sold out, but the $49 level is still available and comes with the same accessories (at the current exchange rate, that's roughly £30 in the UK and AU$65 in Australia). Shipping within the US is free -- an extra $10 charge will apply to send AllBe1 units internationally -- and availability is slated for December."
Flir FX review:|"

At $200 (£163 on Amazon UK), Flir FX is a direct  Nest Cam ,  Netatmo Welcome ,  Samsung SmartCam HD Pro  and  Piper  competitor. Since DIY security cameras in the $200-plus price range are considered high-end -- and since this category as a whole is rapidly growing -- these brands are under increasing pressure to deliver both in terms of HD video quality and advanced features. (Availability in Australia has yet to be announced.)

Although Flir FX lacks third-party smart-home integrations like  IFTTT and  SmartThings , it has lots of options. It offers HD video streaming and recording, free two-day cloud storage, a microSD card slot for local storage, four-hour battery backup, a time-lapse video of the day's events, detection zones and optional accessories that convert the indoor Flir FX into either an outdoor security camera or an action camera.

Even so, this pricey camera suffered from frequent phantom alerts, in-app glitches that returned erroneous error messages and significant lag times between receiving motion or sound alerts and actually being able to view the saved clips in the app. Flir FX is versatile to be sure, but its well-roundedness doesn't translate to top performance. Consider Flir FX if security camera portability is your main concern. If not, I'd pass.

High-end security cameras tend to go above and beyond to distinguish themselves from  less-expensive DIY models . Flir FX is no exception.

It brings 720p video streaming (that's a resolution of 1,280x720) and 1080p video recording (1,920x1080) to the table, along with free recording to a microSD card (not included, it supports sizes ranging from 8 to 64GB) and optional cloud services. Flir's basic cloud subscription gives you ""unlimited"" storage for up to two days and access to the video time-lapse and detection zone features. Seven-day storage costs $10 per month or $100 per year, and 30-day storage costs $20 per month or $200 per year.

If you tire of having a power-adapter-tethered Flir FX, you can pull the plug and enjoy the camera cord-free for up to four hours (when it's attached to the camera stand; two hours if you detach the camera from its stand) before it needs to be recharged. If that wasn't enough mobility for you, the Flir brand sells optional accessories designed to transform the indoor-only FX model into a weatherproof outdoor security camera, a waterproof sport/action camera or a dashboard-mounted car camera.

Looking at the side-by-side comparison above, you can see that no other camera in its price range offers both local and cloud storage options. And while battery-powered security cameras like the indoor-only  Homeboy  and the indoor/outdoor  Netgear Arlo  have some advanced flexibility over many of their peers, none of the models I've reviewed come close to matching Flir FX's versatility.

In addition to its basic motion and sound alerts, this camera also has temperature and humidity sensors so you can set customizable environmental notifications. But my favorite advanced feature by far is Flir FX's ""Rapid Recap."" Rapid Recap is a little tricky to explain, but it gives you a condensed time-stamped time-lapse video of all of the activity that's taken place within a specified amount of time.

Folks using the free two-day cloud option only get to create three Rapid Recaps per cycle, while subscribers at the $10 and $30 level have access to unlimited recaps. Check out the video below for a better idea of what Rapid Recap can do. As you can imagine, this feature would definitely come in handy if you want a quick look at everything that happened at home during a 6-to-12 hour period (free cloud service users can recap up to 6 hours, while paid users can recap up to 8 hours for the $10, seven-day subscription and up to 12 hours for the $20, 30-day subscription).

Before I could start testing out all of these features, I had to download the Flir FX app (it's available for Android and iOS devices) and follow the instructions to set up my camera. This process went smoothly, although   the app doesn't mask Wi-Fi or account passwords, putting them on full display inside the app. I found that odd, since most other DIY security cam configurations take care to hide those details.

While I didn't have any other concerns or setbacks during setup, I did find the configuration process a little more involved than that of models like Nest Cam, which took all of 5 minutes. The Flir app even instructs you to charge your FX for at least 20 minutes before continuing to the next step. That isn't complicated, but it is a little inconvenient if you're hoping for ""plug-and-play.""

The ease-of-use didn't change much once I connected the camera and started exploring the app in-depth.

Not only does it have some general clunkiness that makes the navigation learning curve steeper than I'd like, but it was glitchy, too.

Nearly every time that I enabled motion alerts, I received the following error: ""Update camera 'Front Door' -- There was an error updating the camera.""

Confusingly, the error message was completely erroneous since the app always completed the ""enable motion"" command successfully.

Performance was also hit-or-miss. You have the option to select between HD and SD quality for live streaming (to ease any bandwidth concerns), but the HD quality was regularly grainier and more pixelated than expected in both day- and night-vision modes.

I also received numerous phantom motion alerts during testing, many of which popped up in oddly consistent two- or three-second intervals for hours, rendering the highest sensitivity setting on the motion sensor setting all but useless. Switching the setting to medium or low sensitivity did help, but inaccurate alerts still snuck in occasionally.

There was an annoying lag time between receiving a sound or motion alert and being able to actually find the clip for review in the activity log. Sometimes a clip would appear right away and others it would take 15 or more minutes for it to populate.

That often meant that selecting ""Open screen"" on the in-app alert (as seen in the center screenshot above) didn't work, since that specific video hadn't yet been saved in the log.

Like many security cameras, the black Flir FX blends in easily with its surroundings. It features an adjustable stand that that can fold and extend with minimal effort, although it isn't optimized for rotation. I also wish it had a magnetic base, like Nest Cam and Netgear Arlo.

I like that you can remove the camera from its stand, but it doesn't feel as sturdy as models like Nest Cam or  ArcSoft's Simplicam . Generally, though, Flir FX camera looks pretty good and seems durable enough for indoor use (the optional accessories for outdoor use would add a much-needed layer of protection).

There's a lot happening in the DIY security camera market today. While Flir FX definitely offers an impressive array of features, it needs to perform better to stay competitive in the smart-home industry. Specifically, its app is glitchy, its alerts are unreliable, and its streaming quality is surprisingly grainy for HD.

Flir FX is also missing third-party partnerships, and those will become increasingly important as  Apple's Siri-based HomeKit platform ,  Google's Brillo operating system and other Internet of Things powerhouses, like  Works with Nest, continue to develop. Skip Flir FX unless you really need a security-and-action-cam-in-one."
Netatmo Welcome review:|"

For me, the word ""surveillance"" conjures Orwellian images of Big Brother. The line between security and privacy can certainly be a blurry one. The Netatmo Welcome aims to keep both intact by getting to know you and your family, and letting you go about your business while it keeps watch for signs of strangers. A $200 connected camera with built-in face recognition, the Netatmo Welcome can keep track of who it's seen, and you can customize alerts based on the person triggering them.

The Welcome also packs in an appealing list of specs and features. All data is stored locally, for free, on an 8GB SD card included in the package. You can watch a live stream in full HD and it can sense motion anywhere in its 130 degree field of view, even at night via its infrared night vision.

Except, at $200, it's competing with the best of the best in terms of connected cams between the  Nest Cam  and  Piper , and it doesn't quite stack up in terms of responsiveness, breadth of features, or options to connect it to a larger smart home. In terms of security, it's even bested by free options like  Manything  and  Salient Eye . Working facial recognition puts the Netatmo Welcome in a league of its own, but I'm not ready to call that league the majors.

If you're familiar with Netatmo's previous product, the  Netatmo Urban Weather Station , you'll find the look of the Welcome quite familiar. Like those environmental sensors, the cam is a tall thin cylinder with an inoffensive color that my colleague Tyler Lizenby tells me is called ""Champagne Gold."" He said it reminded him of a popular finish on Stratocaster guitars.

You can purchase the Netatmo online for $200 from Amazon, Home Depot, Best Buy, and the Netatmo website. It's currently available in the UK from Amazon.co.uk for £200. Netatmo assured me the Welcome is on its way to Australia in the near future, but you won't be able to purchase it there quite yet. The American price converts to about AU$262.

The top and bottom of the Welcome accent the gold with white, and a black strip runs down the middle of the cylinder. At the top of the strip, the camera's lens bubbles out slightly, but as a whole, the device doesn't look much like a camera. It's inoffensive and pleasant, except at night, when a glowing red eye flips on as the camera switches to night vision.

In an otherwise dark room, I found Netatmo's bright red eye quite creepy. During the day, you can forget the Welcome is watching you. At night, you might not.

On the back of the device, you'll find a slot for your micro SD card. It comes with an 8GB card installed, but you can push it in and it'll pop out if you want to swap in a larger card or a fresh one. Just know that when you do that, you swap out everything it's learned as well. So be prepared to reteach your camera who's who if you ever want to replace the memory.

You'll also plug in the power cable or Ethernet cord on the back of the device, or you can attach it to your computer with the included USB cable. Since it's not battery powered, you'll have to plug it in somewhere. It does include Wi-Fi, so the Ethernet port is just there if you prefer a wired connection.

Getting Netatmo setup on your Wi-Fi is quick and painless. Plug it into the wall and you can use the Welcome app on your iPhone or Android device to go through the process. Plug it into your computer and you can use the Web interface on any common browser.

On the computer, you need to create a Netatmo account, then use the Web interface to identify your Wi-Fi network, enter your password if you have one, and you're done. You'll give a name to both the camera and the location for the camera, then Netatmo advises moving it to a wall outlet and pointing it to at your door.

Once you're up and running, the computer interface is quite a bit more limited than the Welcome's app counterpart. You can watch a live feed, watch and download any event recordings, and see who's home and who's away. To train the system and customize alerts, you'll need to use the app.

With the app set up, you'll plug it in and flip your Welcome upside down. After a few seconds, you'll see a blue light flashing, and the Welcome will pair with your device's Bluetooth and use that signal to find available networks. Select the signal you want, flip it right-side up, and the camera will start monitoring.

Expect it to take up to a minute after the signal starts to get a live feed, but that's just on the initial setup. After that, I found the app quite responsive. I tested the Welcome both at my home and at the office. Switching back and forth required me to hit ""Install a new Welcome camera"" in the Settings menu. It's a little counterintuitive, and it can only remember one network at a time, but once I knew where to go to start the process, it was just as quick getting it set up in a new location.

Moving the camera around the office was easy enough. Unplugging it and plugging it back in didn't cause me to lose any settings, or force me to set it up on Wi-Fi again. Though ideally, you won't need to move the Welcome much once you get it set up.

Finding a perfect location for it might be tricky, depending on your home setup. It's meant to watch your door. Netatmo's instructions specifically warn against pointing it out a window or anywhere with too strong a backlight. You can't attach Netatmo to a wall, so you'll need to find flat surface for it where it can reach a plug and see the door without too much interference from backlight. Here's where the pleasant design proves a little inflexible.

As it runs, Netatmo also gets a little warm to the touch. The instructions mention this, and reassure you that it's normal and won't ever get hot enough to cause damage. I found this to be true. I left it running for more than a week straight. It'd get pretty warm after just a couple of hours, then would level off. It's disconcerting, but not a safety issue.

Get the camera pointed the right way, and you can watch the live feed and dive into Netatmo's many useful features. The camera films constantly, and records when it senses motion or sees a face. The 8GB card can supposedly hold up to 100 clips at a time, and will roll out the old ones when it starts getting full.

The Welcome has nominal cloud storage. Nothing is kept there except a single screen capture of each event, so you can get an idea of what happened even before hitting play. It's a fine approach, as Netatmo avoids the fees of competitors like the Nest Cam and  Arcsoft . It's also meant to add to your privacy. Footage of your family is kept locally, for you and yours only.

If you want to keep a clip, you can easily download it to whatever device you're using. It's a nice extra touch that will make it easy to save and share any adorable or funny moments the camera captures.

You can watch the footage in full HD. The Welcome supports up to 1080p video, but I let the resolution adjust automatically based on my signal speed, and it would often take a few seconds at relatively low definition to catch up and show me a clear picture. Even then, in supposedly full HD, it never looked quite as good as the images from the Nest Cam.

The Welcome matches the Nest Cam with a 130-degree field of view, and night vision. Though it rounds out its feature list with a motion sensor, it falls short of the field by not having audio alerts or two-way audio.

The Netatmo Welcome also falls short of the Nest Cam and Piper as a building block of a larger smart home, at least for now. Piper doubles as a Z-Wave hub, and can talk with any accessories that uses that signal protocol. The Nest Cam can talk with the  Nest Thermostat  and since Nest is owned by Google, it might be a part of Google's recently announced larger smart home centered around  Brillo.

For now, Netatmo stands alone. You even need a separate app for the Netatmo Weather Station and the Netatmo Thermostat. Eventually, the company hopes to integrate the three, and in the near future, the Welcome will get a sizable amount of friends thanks to IFTTT.

According to a company representative, the Welcome will have its own IFTTT channel starting in September, so your options for wider smart home integration will suddenly become plentiful.

And on the real selling point of the camera, the facial recognition, Netatmo separates itself from the competition in a good way.

We have seen facial recognition on a connected camera before. The  Arcsoft Simplicam  has it, though it was in a beta stage when we reviewed it, and it definitely still felt like a prototype. You'd stand in front of it and turn to each side -- mug-shot-style -- so it could map your face, then it could supposedly recognize you from strangers. Except, it would get mixed up readily. We have a couple of bearded males in our CNET Appliances office, and the Simplicam would frequently confuse one for the next.

Netatmo takes an entirely different approach to facial recognition. For one, you don't start off your profile with a mugshot. After it's plugged in, it'll automatically start looking for faces. You can stand in front of the camera for awhile if you'd like -- that'll probably help it get to know you faster -- or you can just point it at the door and go about your business.

Once it finds faces, you'll see a snapshot pop up with a question mark next to it. You can see the snapshot on the computer interface or the app, but you can only teach the system about the face it saw and customize notifications for each profile via the app, so you're better off switching away from your computer at this point and pulling out your phone.

Tap on the face, and you'll be directed to the video clip it recorded of that person. Long-press the face, and you can identify it and start building a profile. For mine, I gave the system my name and let it use its own snapshot as my profile picture. You can swap in a different pic of your own for the profile shot if you prefer.

Outside of the basics, you can use the profile edit page to customize notifications for each individual. Select whether or not you want notifications when this person arrives. You can specify a time window for these, so you can get notifications when your spouse gets home most of the time, but not on the occasion he or she has to work past your bedtime.

You can also set when to record each individual. Maybe you don't want any videos of your family's adults, or maybe you want them only on arrival, but not any subsequent times the camera sees them. However, maybe you do want the camera recording whenever it sees the kids, so you can capture any spontaneous precious moments.

Each time the Welcome sees a face, it'll either associate it with one of the existing profiles you've created, or show you a snapshot with a question mark next to it to indicate that the face wasn't recognized. The idea is that you'll teach the system to know your family and friends, then the only unrecognized faces will be strangers.

Early on, expect it to have a lot of trouble recognizing your family. When you long press an unknown face, you'll have three options: identify, forget this person, or not a face. Selecting identify either lets you build a new profile, or tell the system that it was looking at someone it was supposed to know already. I never encountered a situation where the camera took a snapshot of something that wasn't a face, but after I built profiles for myself and my coworkers, I had to match a lot of unknowns to existing profiles for the first couple of days.

The system's up-front about this. Each profile shows a strength meter for how well the camera knows you. If it's only seen you once, expect the profile to show a strength of one out of five bars. As you move in front of the camera at different angles, and during different times of the day, you'll probably need to tell the system repeatedly that the unknown face it just saw was you, but as you do so, and as it sees you in different lights, it'll slowly get better and better.

Netatmo claims it can build a full-strength profile of a person in one to two weeks, depending on whether you linger in front of the camera or pass quickly. In practice, I found it did take around two weeks to get my profile to full strength, but to get it over the hump, I actually pointed the camera at my face while I sat on the couch for a couple of hours.

I haven't asked any of my other coworkers to undergo this scrutiny, instead, they've passed in front of it only as a person would when entering a home. Three weeks after our testing started, we have quite a few profiles at three out of five bars and one at four out of five.

Even up to three bars, expect Netatmo to be confused by the face as much as it gets it right. Once a profile hits four bars, it'll recognize you most of the time, but even with a full profile, I still occasionally have to identify myself for Netatmo.

Netatmo claims this is intentional. It wanted the Welcome to never deliver false positives, and always check when it was unsure. I appreciate that, actually, and found that to be true. I'd rather identify my family member again than have the Netatmo tell me Susie was home when it was actually a stranger who looks similar to Susie.

Netatmo's face recognition software misses a lot, but it acknowledges those misses instead of guessing wrong. Never once during our testing did it identify the wrong person, it simply asked for clarification.

Once you have profiles built, Netatmo's system will organize them into two buckets called ""Home"" and ""Away."" When the Welcome sees a face, it moves that person into the Home bucket. Again, you're ideally pointing the camera at the front door, so it can see when someone enters.

The criteria for a person to go back to being ""Away"" is a little less intuitive. By default, Netatmo marks a person away if it hasn't seen her for four hours. You can change that time window from 1 to 12 hours, but based on the mechanic, I found the names of the buckets a little misleading. Netatmo can't actually tell if someone's home, just if it's seen the person recently.

You can manually tell the system that a person has left after a long press on a profile pic, and there's a button at the top right side of the app to mark everyone away simultaneously. You can also set up geolocation based on your phone's GPS.

Identify yourself to the system by selecting ""This is me"" on your profile edit screen, and toggle on the ""Use my location"" option beneath that. In theory, after your phone leaves a 250m radius of the camera (820 feet), it'll switch your profile to away.

Invite any family members with a smartphone to create a Netatmo account and tag their own profiles, and they can also turn on geolocation. Each family member you invite can access the system separately on their own device, but be careful about sharing your camera liberally. You have to add someone for them to get access, so the initial barrier to entry is sensible to me, but once someone's in, you can't limit what they can do. That person will have full control over the camera and the profiles just like you.

Again, Netatmo claims this is intentional. It wants the system to be about sharing with your family as opposed to spying on them. I agree with the logic, I'd just be cautious about trying to give your neighbors any sort of ""backup"" access. You won't be able to mark their profile as backup in any way.

Once your family has the app and access to your camera on their own phones, they can all turn on geolocation to make the Away bucket more location based than time based. Except, I had a lot of trouble getting geolocation to trigger at all on my Android based Samsung Galaxy S5. My colleague Megan Wollerton, with her iPhone 6 plus, did get geolocation to successfully trigger once.

The Home and Away feature would make more sense if this aspect of it was polished, and perhaps it will be in a future update. For the time being, ""Home"" and ""Away"" are just more catchy ways of saying ""seen recently"" or ""Not seen recently.""

It's a shame the Home and Away feature proves inaccurate in practice, because you can smartly customize the security notifications of the camera based on whether or not someone's home.

The Netatmo Welcome can send you push notifications in three circumstances: when someone known arrives (as in it's seeing them for the first time in a few hours), when it sees an unknown face, or when it detects motion.

After you identify yourself, you'll also get a unique notification reading ""Welcome Home!"" when it sees you for the first time in awhile.

You can be notified of unknown faces always, or only when no one's home. Similarly, you can set the camera to record on motion detection, and notify on motion detection -- never, only when nobody is home, or always.

It's a smart system that fits with the theme of being more alert when you're not around, and keeping your privacy intact when you are. I just wish it had a few more detailed options. For instance, I wish there was a way to turn off notifications for a person or group of people. If either parent is home, I don't need push notifications. If it's just the kids and the babysitter, I'd still want the system on high alert.

More problematic is the speed and accuracy at which notifications are delivered. Watching the live feed, you'll notice about a 10-second delay. The same delay occurs with alerts. The Welcome is smart enough to frame recordings to start a couple of seconds before the trigger and run a couple of seconds after, so you'll still be able to see the whole event. In an actual emergency, though, that 10 seconds could make a big difference, and if a burglar is wary enough to recognize the camera and unplug it after breaking in, you won't be able to see any footage until the camera's plugged back in. If it's smashed, that footage will likely be lost for good -- a potentially big downside to keeping all recordings saved locally.

The Netatmo Welcome proved mostly reliable in terms of alerting to and recording every trigger, but it wasn't perfect. Even with the camera set to high alert -- all people marked as away and all notification options turned on -- we were able to fool the motion sensor by moving very fast or very slow past it.

It did catch us more than half of the times we tried to fool it, but better security cameras like the  Piper NV  will catch you every time, and there's no way to adjust the sensitivity on the Netatmo Welcome.

The Netatmo Welcome is a sentry that tries hard, but is a little slow on the draw. It's slow to pick up motion and slow to learn faces. It'll sometimes miss triggers, and it's very slow picking up that a face is even present, especially at night.

When I walked past the camera after hours, I got alerts that it had sensed motion, but it had a lot of trouble telling that it was a person, let alone that it was me. As a result, Netatmo's dedication to privacy backfired a little bit.

I took the camera home to test it over a weekend. I told it I didn't want it recording me, and it had a pretty good idea of who I was at this point, but I wanted it recording motion and sending me relevant notifications whenever I wasn't home, and always sending me a notification when it saw an unknown face.

Because of the way the Away system works, and because it's slow to pick up faces, it went into high alert mode 4 hours after I went to bed. That's fine, since I would want a sentry to perk up at night. But when I woke up for a mid sleep glass of water, it sensed motion, but couldn't tell it was me, and it recorded me walking sleepily around my apartment in my PJs.

Thankfully, my coworkers deleted their accounts before they saw this footage. In a lot of ways, that could have been much worse, and it shows that Netatmo still has some work to do to polish the Welcome. It's promising, but not quite there yet on security or privacy.

I have a lot of respect for what Netatmo is trying to do here, and at every step, it airs on the side of caution. If it's not sure it recognizes a face, it'll say it's unknown and let you identify it. I appreciate that, as it's a little more work on your part, but you won't get false positives from someone that looks like your spouse. Unfortunately, it's always slow and sometimes unreliable. It has trouble picking up any face if you move past it quickly, and it might not even register that there was motion.

The Welcome has an appealing concept here, to be sure. Record any strangers, get notifications when the kids arrive, and tighten security when no one's home. The Netatmo Welcome swings for the fences, as no home device has successfully implemented face recognition before.  Simplicam  tried, but mixed people up frequently. Netatmo comes much closer, and might get there soon with future updates. For the time being, it's a fine option if you want to be on the cutting edge and play with facial recognition. If you want the best connected cam or security cam out there, you can find a lot of better options, specifically the  Nest Cam  and  Piper NV ."
Nest Cam Indoor review:|"

Startup Dropcam emerged on the connected webcam scene in 2009. The team churned out a handful of products over the years and Dropcam -- particularly with help from its $200  Dropcam Pro  -- quickly rose up the ranks as the high-res DIY security cam company to beat. Then, smart-thermostat maker and Google property Nest swooped in and  bought the brand for a cool $555 million last June and, after  some serious speculation, finally unveiled a ""new-and-improved"" Dropcam Pro replacement called  Nest Cam just last week.

Here's the gist: Nest Cam is better than Dropcam Pro. It has a full 1080p video resolution, a rotating, magnetic stand, a new app interface as well as a couple of other minor improvements. It even retails for the same amount as its predecessor. But all that stuff isn't enough of an upgrade for me to urge existing Dropcam Pro users to run to a local store to snatch one up today. If you're in the market for a webcam with a few security features, the $200 Nest Cam is rapidly replacing Dropcam Pro as the gold standard and I highly recommend it. Just don't expect it to function as  a true security camera .

I'm a little torn on Nest Cam. Its specs -- 1080p video (specifically, a 1920x1080, 2-megapixel resolution), night vision, two-way talk, sound and motion alerts, optional Nest Aware cloud services that let you revisit past footage and set activity zones for a fee -- are solid. A quick side-by-side comparison of Nest Cam with  ArcSoft's Simplicam ,  Dropcam Pro ,  Icontrol's Piper (original)  and  Samsung's SmartCam HD Pro  clearly shows that it's competitive with these highly rated models.

The thing is, it really isn't a fully functioning security camera -- which would be a deal breaker if its video quality wasn't so darn impressive.

Its biggest offense is that it doesn't have customizable alerts. Instead, it is programmed to issue a maximum of one motion or sound alert every 30 minutes, just like Dropcam Pro.

In other words, I could walk in front of the camera and trigger an immediate motion alert (assuming that it had been at least 30 minutes since the previous notification) and for the next half-hour won't receive any notifications at all. So say I triggered a motion alert while I was turning off a lamp in the living room before heading to bed for the night. If someone broke in 20 minutes later, I wouldn't receive a notification. And, if they happened to spend only a few minutes rifling through my stuff before making an escape, I wouldn't get an alert then, either.

This places Nest Cam pretty far on the webcam side of the spectrum, and it also doesn't offer the best value for cloud recording compared with some other models in the same price range.

You can arm and disarm Icontrol's original Piper as well as  its pricer NV model , and both give you a lot of control over how and when you receive alerts and both come with built-in sirens and free event-based recording. ArcSoft's Simplicam has cloud subscription fees starting at just 5 bucks a month. Even the free  Salient Eye Android app , which converts a camera-equipped Android device of your choosing into a security camera, has arm and disarm functionality, a siren and customizable alerts.

Nest Cam costs $200 in the US and is available at chain retailers like Best Buy, Home Depot and Lowe's nationwide as well as on Nest's online store and on Amazon. Folks in the UK will be able to buy units for £159 starting in July. Nest hasn't announced Australian availability as of yet, but the US price converts to roughly $AU260.

The new Nest Aware cloud video service cost $10 a month for 10 days of continuous recording and $30 a month for 30 days of continuous recording. This is very similar to Dropcam's original subscription levels, although its lowest tier cost $10 a month for 7 days of continuous recording (so you get a few more days of footage for the same price with this new Nest service). That's decent, but it would be much better if they offered a $5 for 5 days option or something else similarly affordable. Along with that, it's really frustrating that you can't customize the sensitivity of the motion sensor and the frequency of related alerts.

Nest Cam never disappointed in terms of video quality. Its live stream in regular and night vision modes were top notch, making it a little easier to pick up on details in a room or a person's features than with Dropcam Pro. (I actually tested a Dropcam Pro alongside Nest Cam so I could pick up on subtle differences between the two.)

"" data-image-credit=""Screenshots by Megan Wollerton/CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""nest-cam-4.jpg"" data-image-filename=""nest-cam-4.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2015/06/26"" data-image-width=""1371"" data-image-height=""1216"">

Take a look at these screenshots comparing Nest Cam and Dropcam Pro in regular and night-vision modes (note that the cameras were side by side so the fields of view may look slightly different, although both are 130 degrees).

While Nest Cam's 1080p video is slightly better than Dropcam Pro's 720p feed, it isn't dramatic enough to make replacing your Dropcam Pro worthwhile. But, it is a fantastic live-streaming device -- one of the best we've seen. Piper's 1080p is good, but its 180-degree fisheye lens distorts the view to some extent. Samsung's SmartCam HD Pro probably comes the closest, but its feed still wasn't as clear as the new Nest Cam.

I also received the motion and sound alerts promptly, although they were limited to 30-minute increments. The activity zone feature that lets you target specific areas for alerts worked consistently as well.

Although you can't currently integrate Nest Cam with third-party products or services like  IFTTT, you can link it to the  Nest Learning Thermostat  via the ""Home & Away"" feature in the Nest app. When you enable this feature, your Nest Cam will turn on when you set the Nest Learning Thermostat to Away and off when you set it to Home. This feature was very responsive and worked every time.

Nest hasn't shared any specifics about integrations with  its parent company, Google and the  Brillo Internet of Things operating system that it announced in May, either, although Greg Hu, a Nest product manager, did say this month that there would be more to share on that front ""soon."" I also expect to hear details about partnerships within Nest's own Internet of Things initiative,  Works with Nest, which pairs Nest products with third-party devices for advanced home automations.

Nest Cam is an attractive camera with a lot of built-in functionality. Like the Dropcam Pro, you can remove the camera from the stand and its black finish blends in well with most surroundings. This version adds on a magnetic base as well as a rotating stand so you can more easily install the camera and optimize its angle.

Setup was seamless. I already had the Nest app from using the Learning Thermostat, so I just opened the app and selected ""Add product."" From there, the app walks you through everything you need to configure your camera, including selecting Nest Cam from the list of options (you can add Learning Thermostats, Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, Nest Cams, Dropcam Pros and the original Dropcam on the new Nest app), scanning the QR code on the back of the camera and entering in local Wi-Fi details.

Once it connects, you'll have access to the home screen, the live feed and more. You'll also get a free trial of the Nest Aware service so you can decide if continuous recording and activity zones are worth it.

Nest Cam is an excellent camera and its streamlined app provides easy access to your live feed, activity log and settings. $10 per month is a little steep for entry-level cloud services and the 30-minute wait between alerts is less than helpful. Even so, Nest Cam is easy to recommend to anyone interested in an top-of-the-line webcam with some security features thrown into the mix.

Brains at your bedside with the ambitious Luzi Smart Lamp|"

There's a relatively strong case for a smarter bedside. It's the place where most of us charge our devices each night, and the place where we seek out a comfortable night's sleep. From a connected perspective, we want things to turn on when we wake up and turn off when we hit the sack, so why not anchor whole-home controls right by the bed?

The Luzi Smart Lamp wants the job -- or rather, all of the jobs. Aside from lighting up the room and telling the time on its programmable LCD touchscreen, Luzi boasts four USB ports capable of powering multiple phones and tablets, Qi and PMA-certified wireless charging smarts, and even a handy charging cradle for Apple Watch owners. The LEDs inside of Luzi can change colors, too, with full RGB control and color temperatures ranging from a warm, orange glow to something hotter, whiter, and closer to daylight. Luzi's team claims that those changes can help ease you into a better night's rest.

On top of all that, Luzi borrows a page from Amazon Echo and uses a built-in microphone to listen to your voice commands, and built-in Bluetooth speakers to talk back. That means you can dim the lights or play your favorite music just by asking it nicely. Luzi also promises compatibility with third party smart gadgets like  Switchmate ,  FitBit  and  Lockitron Bolt, so you'll be able to interact with your connected home using voice commands, too -- a handy way of making sure the front door is locked before you fall asleep.

So how much does a lamp that smart run for? Unsurprisingly, quite a bit. The makers of Luzi have it priced at a lofty $399, though if you catch the early-bird pricing on Indiegogo when the campaign launches on Tuesday, June 23, you'll be able to get one for $269. That's still an awful lot of money -- more than Amazon Echo, and more than the futuristic  Aerelight OLED desk lamp , which also comes with built-in wireless charging capabilities.

There's room for some healthy skepticism, here. Luzi's promising quite a lot, including things like voice control that  have proven particularly difficult for tech startups to get right. Ambition aside, crowdfunded smart-home gadgets -- even simple ones -- have been hit and miss, with more misses than hits. For an example of one that's struggled to deliver (literally), look no further than Luzi-partner Lockitron.

I'd also recommend taking Luzi's marketing with a few grains of salt. Shots of a naked iPhone charging wirelessly are a bit miselading (similar footage shows up in Luzi's promo video). Unlike devices like the  Nexus 7  and  Galaxy S6 Edge ,  iPhones aren't equipped with native Qi or PMA compatibility. That means you'll need to slap on a special case.

Luzi's got a lot of work to do if it wants to be a smart-home standout. Voice control is a clear connected-home battleground, and big players like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are already in the game. That means Luzi will essentially be going toe-to-toe with Siri, Alexa, Cortana and OK Google all at once. The window for a startup to stand out might already be closed.

Luzi's creators claim that they're developing their own voice commands for the lamp, but also utilizing third-party software integrations -- including Google's.

Partnerships will likely play a big role in Luzi's efforts. A channel on the free, ever-growing online automation service IFTTT would certainly help, as would compatibility with an existing, established platform like  Wink or SmartThings. Luzi comes with a built-in temperature sensor, which might indicate that it has its sights set on  the Works with Nest initiative. Of course, all of that is assuming that Luzi makes it to market, which is never guaranteed with crowdfunding campaigns.

Luzi's creators plan to start shipping units out to backers in March 2016. Initially, Luzi will only be available in the US and in Europe, though the Luzi team plans to expand to additional regions by the end of 2016 (that $399 retail price converts roughly to £250/AU$510, while the early-bird pricing comes out to £170/AU$345). We'll keep an eye on it and see if we can't test one out next year."
Ikea Ledare LED (1000L) review:|"

Ikea impressed us last year with a low-cost light bulb called the  Ledare LED . This year, the Swedish retail giant is expanding the line with new Ledare shapes, sizes and SKUs -- including a bigger, brighter bulb that puts out 1,000 lumens' worth of light and sells for $11 (the value dips a bit in Australia and the UK, where the bulb sells for AU$18 and £10, respectively).

1,000 lumens is a tricky number, sitting somewhat awkwardly in between the 800 to 900 lumens you'd expect from a 60W replacement and the 1,100 lumens or so that you'd get with a 75W replacement. Fortunately, the bulb competes fairly well in both categories, offering a distinct bump in brightness over the former and clear-cut value compared with the latter. It also offers a superior color rendering score close to 90 out of 100 -- noticeably better than the LED average of 80, and good for better-looking colors wherever you use the thing. If 800 lumens isn't bright enough for your tastes, or if 75W replacements aren't affordable enough for your home improvement budget, then the 1000L Ledare might be just what you need.

The 13W, 1000L version of Ikea's Ledare LED looks more or less the same as the 10W, 600L version we reviewed last year, albeit slightly larger. It isn't an overtly innovative build like the tube-shaped  GE Bright Stik LED  or the flattened down  Philips SlimStyle  -- it's just a typical-looking LED light bulb that doesn't want to rock the design boat.

With the 600L Ledare LED, you had the option of a frosted globe design or a clear globe that put the inner hardware on full display. That option is gone with the 1000L version, which comes with a frosted globe only. That isn't such a bad thing -- the frosted globe tested slightly better in brightness and color quality than the clear globe last year.

The new Ledare promises to be just as good with colors, and noticeably brighter than its little brother. It's brighter than the 60W replacement pack, where 800 lumens is the norm. However, it also comes in below the 75W replacement level, where you'd expect at least 1,100 lumens.

That makes things a bit tricky. Based on its 13W power draw, it fits in better with the 75W crowd, but at around 950 lumens of measured light output (and a price of $11 per bulb), it merits comparison to 60W replacement LEDs, too.

There's an awful lot to look at in those two charts, so let me help walk you through the comparisons. First, at the 60W level, you'll see that it isn't as efficient as the competition, putting out 74 lumens per watt. That adds up to an extra 50 cents per year or so in energy costs when compared to the 60W replacements from  Osram  and  Philips , which lead the pack in efficiency. Sure, 50 cents per year is practically nothing, but if you're looking to switch over 20 or 30 bulbs in your home, it might be worth considering.

At the 75W level, the Ledare's efficiency comes up short again, though it's a lot closer. It also ranks last in brightness, and it's the only bulb in the pack that isn't Energy Star-certified or covered by a warranty.

The ace up Ledare's sleeve is its score on the color rendering index, which indicates how accurately a given light source can illuminate different shades of different numbers. The 1000L Ledare scored a 90, which is fairly exceptional -- almost every LED we test comes in around 80, as both charts make clear. We'll dig into color rendering a little deeper in the next section.

Compared with bulbs at the 60W replacement level, you're getting that high CRI and a bump in brightness. At the 75W level, the 1000L Ledare offers the high CRI and a bargain price point. It doesn't dominate either category though, with across-the-board compromises in efficiency and warranty, along with less brightness than you'd get from strong competitors like the  Cree 75W Replacement LED  and the  Philips SlimStyle 75W Replacement LED .

A light bulb's core function is to convert electricity into light. Incandescents do it by heating a tungsten filament until it glows, but that's an inefficient process that's better at producing heat than producing light.

LEDs like this Ledare bulb promise to perform better -- and save you money in the process. In the US, a 75W incandescent will add about $9 per year to your energy bill, whereas the Ledare LED will add just a buck and a half. At that rate, it'd pay for itself in less than a year and a half.

Still, the 1000L Ledare gets outperformed by LED competitors at both the 75W and 60W levels. In our integrating sphere -- a big, hollow ball with a reflective interior used to grab accurate lumen readings -- the Ledare LED clocked in at 958 lumens. That 42-lumen difference between the stated and measured light outputs falls within our sphere's margin of error of +/- 5 percent, but it's still a lower result than I'd have liked to have seen. Divide those 958 lumens by the bulb's 13 watts, and you'll see that the 1000L Ledare LED puts out 74 lumens per watt -- each and every bulb in those charts from the last section performs better than that.

The color quality scores were more impressive. Like the 600L Ledare, the 1000L Ledare is rated at a warm, yellowy color temperature of 2,700K. With our spectrometer peeking into our sphere, we measured it at 2,702K. That's about as close to spot on as it gets.

Even more impressive: the aforementioned color rendering score of 90. Simplified a bit, the color rendering score is really an average of several scores, each one corresponding to a different shade. If that's not an excuse to draw up a multicolored bar graph in Excel, I don't know what is.

The most important thing about that bar graph is the red column at position number 9. Red tones are always tough for LEDs to illuminate accurately, because LEDs don't put out nearly as much energy at the infrared part of the spectrum as incandescents. As a result, LEDs often struggle to post red scores outside of single digits, while incandescents generally score very well with reds (and on the color rendering index as a whole).

With the Ledare LED, the red score is 53.7. That's not as high a score as you'll get with LEDs designed specifically to boost the CRI score, like the  Cree TW Series or  GE Reveal  LED lines, but it's still a distinct and noticeable step up from the categorical average, and one that merits a closer look.

To do that, let's take a look at a common bowl of colorful, candy-coated chocolate. From left to right, you've got the same bowl of candy lit by three different bulbs. The first is the Cree 75W Replacement LED, a decent option with a ho-hum color rendering score of 80. The yellow tones are a bit overpowering, and the reds and oranges are noticeably dull.

On the other side of the spectrum is bowl number three, lit with a standard 60W incandescent from GE. Here, the color rendering score is just shy of a perfect 100 -- you can see that the white bowl looks almost perfectly white, and that all of the colors look vivid and distinct.

Now look at the bowl in the middle. That's lit by the Ikea 1000L Ledare LED, with its color rendering score of 90. Like the incandescent, the whites look white, the colors look vivid, and the yellow isn't too overpowering. That last bit is especially impressive -- a lot of LEDs that emphasize color quality will try and tame those runaway yellow tones by jacking the color temperature up to something less yellowy and more whitish. The Ledare LED doesn't do that -- it sits right at a warm 2,700K, but still manages to keep the yellow tones in check.

One last performance consideration is dimmer compatibility. Like the 600L version, the 1000L Ledare worked quite well with both modern dimmer switches and outdated models designed for incandescent use only. I didn't notice any bothersome flicker as I dialed the bulb down, and was only able to hear a faint buzz if I pressed my ear right against the bulb.

Still, it wasn't a perfect performance. At best, I was only able to dial the Ledare LED down to about 9 percent of its total light output. That isn't bad -- a minimum below 10 percent earns a passing grade in my book -- but we've seen other bulbs capable of dialing down below 5 percent, or even cleanly down to 0 percent. Make no mistake, the Ledare LED is a solid dimmability pick, but it isn't the best. If dimming performance matters most to you, then you'll want to consider splurging on the  Philips 75W Replacement LED .

The LED market is much more competitive than it was last year, and as a result, the 1000L Ledare LED isn't as much of a standout as its 600L predecessor was. It gets beaten in efficiency by almost every major competitor in both the 75 and 60W categories. Since it sits in the awkward middle ground between the two, you're forced to compromise either the full brightness of the 75W level or  the ever-increasing value of the 60W level.

All that said, the 1000L Ledare LED offers outstanding color rendering capabilities, enough so to set it apart as a viable option. I like it more as a 75W replacement, where the $11 price can't be beat and the dip in efficiency isn't quite as dramatic, but it's a real temptation next to more affordable 60W replacements, too. If color quality matters to you (or if you just painted your living room red), give this bulb a close look."
Impart weather savvy on your sprinklers with Wise Orchard|"

With the Wise Orchard sprinkler valve, my garden now knows more about the weather than I do. It draws info from thousands of weather stations and local forecast services and will automate your watering schedule accordingly. With it, you can supposedly automate your gardening care to be as hands-off as you'd like, and you'll never run into the situation where your sprinkler turns on during a rainstorm.

Wise Orchard, from startup company Wise Computing, attaches to your hose and fits on the standard pipe threads for both the US and Europe, so it can control the majority of garden-hose-fed sprinklers as well as common drip-irrigation systems. Put in four AA batteries (which can supposedly last up to a year), connect it to your home's Wi-Fi system, and you'll be up and running.

You'll be able to control your Wise Orchard valve with its iOS or Android app, and you can keep as much control over the watering schedule as you'd like. Turn your sprinklers on or off manually without ever leaving your couch, program the times yourself, or let Wise Orchard do the automation.

Wise Computing claims to have a wide database of plants, so it can recognize and customize a program for your specific species and give you recommendations for when to harvest or prune. Smartly, you can walk the line between automatic and manual control to conform to any local watering restrictions. Simply tell Wise Orchard when it's allowed to run the sprinklers, and it'll program the schedule from there.

Another clever perk to the system -- it stores your watering schedule in its local memory, so it can keep working even if your home signal fails. That said, I doubt it will be able to make weather adjustments should that happen.

Wise Orchard looks to be a clear step up from a non-connected irrigation timer. Using it will certainly be more convenient than walking out to the garden and turning on the faucet yourself, but it's not the first device to smarten up watering.

Both the  Rachio Iro  and  Blossom Smart Watering Controller  do largely the same thing but replace the controller for your built-in sprinkler system. Wise Orchard is one of the few that just needs a gardening hose to work, making it arguably more customizable and accessible than Rachio or Blossom since you can point a sprinkler anywhere. Still, if you have a built-in system, one of those models probably makes more sense for you as they can each automate all of your zones with one smart device.

The upcoming water valve from  Edyn  connects to a hose and functions in the same way as Wise Orchard, acting as a gatekeeper from your hose to your sprinkler. It does have the additional advantage of the info gathered by the Edyn garden sensor to help it plan your watering schedule. That sensor will gather info from the soil in your beds, so in theory, it can more precisely adjust watering based on that than Wise Orchard will with just forecasts and a temperature sensor.

Since Wise Orchard can't monitor the soil near your plant to get information like Edyn can, it looks to be at a disadvantage in terms of smarts. However, neither Wise Orchard nor Edyn has been released. So perhaps when put to the test, Wise Orchard will be just as effective by focusing on fewer pieces of info.

You can pre-order Wise Orchard via its Kickstarter campaign now. The prices are listed in euros with the US dollar approximation shown underneath, and the device will ship anywhere in the world. You'll spend an extra $10 shipping it to the US or Europe; no word on the cost to ship to Australia. The base price on Kickstarter is about $66, which converts to roughly £43 and AU$86. The expected price at retail is $69 (about £44 and AU$89).

By comparison, the Edyn Water Valve costs $60 (£39 and AU$77) and the Edyn Sensor is $100 (£64 and AU$129). The valve itself will be cheaper, but you'll have to spend more than twice the cost to get the advantage of the associated sensor.

You can join Wise Orchard's beta testers via Kickstarter as well, and that's expected to start in December with the final version of the product shipping in March of 2016. Since each device can only control one hose, you'll need a few to control multiple zones, so the price could add up. If the experience proves seamless and the system can effectively save water while saving you time, buying into this system could end up being a wise move."
Meet Flare, a fresh DIY home security contender|"

Berlin-based BuddyGuard is finishing up a Kickstarter campaign for Flare, its new all-in-one DIY security device that looks like it's part smoke detector, part UFO. With just over a day remaining and more than $160,000 raised, it has already well-exceeded its original $89,271 goal.

Flare reminds me of  Piper  and  Canary , two standalone systems that each come with a camera, a siren, sensors and various other security features.

BuddyGuard's version includes a 1080p camera, motion, tamper and temperature sensors, a microphone, a speaker and a siren. It is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0-enabled and it has a 3G cellular module for uninterrupted access whenever your Internet is spotty. And, you can either power it with a wall plug or with rechargeable lithium ion batteries (the batteries are supposed to last up to three weeks with ""normal usage"").

Setup is supposed to be easy, too. Flare has a magnetic base that's designed to stick to most surfaces with adhesive tape. Then, you just have to stick Flare to its base.

According to BuddyGuard, Flare can tell the difference between you and an intruder and will automatically turn its camera and microphone off if it recognizes your face -- and back again on if it sees someone that its database doesn't recognize. It's also supposed to respond to voice commands, so you should be able to tell it that you'll be away on vacation for a week and it will know to stay active the whole time.

But, you should also be able to use geolocation if you forget to tell Flare that you're leaving. This feature is supposed to access your phone's location to determine whether you're home or away and arm your system accordingly. You can access these various features on Flare's companion Android and iOS app. In addition to its own app options, BuddyGuard has plans for an  IFTTT channel as well.

You've missed your chance for an ""Early Bird"" $195 Flare, but you can still reserve one for $229 (about £149 and AU$300 at the current exchange rate).  Units are available internationally and are scheduled to ship to backers this December."
Chamberlain Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener review:|"

Priced at $268, the fancy Chamberlain Wi-Fi Garage Opener comes with all the hardware necessary to intall a garage door opener you can control from your mobile device. It uses the Chamberlain MyQ mobile application to talk directly to Android and iOS phones and tablets. So equipped you'll be able to open or close your garage door from anywhere you can get online. Likewise the Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener combined with its app can alert you of any door activity as it happens.

Unlike the  Chamberlain MyQ Garage , this kit is no add-on device. It's a full-fledged garage door opener, and installing it is no minor home improvement project. This is especially true if you're like me and have no experience completing or even attempting the task. That's why choosing the Chamberlain Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener over conventional options makes sense, but only if you need to completely replace an archaic system and of course plan to use its connected home capabilities.

Switching out a perfectly good opener just for this machine's slick smart home functions alone simply isn't worth the expense and potential installation headaches when you can buy Chamberlain's easy-to-install add-on kit for less.

From appearance alone you'd never guess the Chamberlain Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener was any different from the legion of similar products lining store shelves. In fact the egg-shaped machine looks identical to practically all of Chamberlain's garage door opener lineup, whether chain or belt driven.

Built to be mounted on support brackets on your garage door ceiling and garage door, the product consists of two primary components. You get the oval-shaped electrical motor housing, and the long rail mechanism that contains the device's plastic belt. Other pieces of the puzzle include a pair of infrared sensors that have to be wired to the main motor housing. The sensors are a safety system designed to keep an eye out for objects or people blocking or standing in the path of the open garage door.

The opener comes with a wall-mounted door control panel that you also need to wire directly to the central unit. Additionally, you get two standard visor remotes bundled with the system, each with three programmable buttons. Made to clip to car sun visors, you can set the remotes to control multiple garage doors or toggle the opener's lights on and off. The last bit of hardware in the Chamberlain kit is a wireless numeric keypad that enables keyless or remoteless entry with a programmable four-digit PIN.

Tucked inside this machine are a few enhancements that go above and beyond your average garage door opener. The Chamberlain Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener model I installed, model HD950WF, represents the company's top-tier smart product.

A robust 1¼-horsepower motor powers the lift system that in terms of sheer strength certainly outclasses my old ½-horsepower devices. The same is true for  ¾ horsepower units you might find in many homes. Sure, it's overkill to have this much lifting muscle at your disposal -- enough to conceivably operate a 4-car garage door all by itself -- but I admit it's comforting.

Chamberlain also explained to me that the benefit of a stronger motor isn't limited to lifting bigger loads. A muscular unit typically lasts longer too. While I can't verify this claim, it's a mechanical reality that the less an electric motor has to work over time, the greater its expected longevity. I also appreciate how the belt drive train is crafted for quiet operation. Anything that produces less noise than my medieval chain-driven openers I count as a positive.

Another welcome feature is its backup battery. Sitting inside a compartment on the left side of the opener, in the event of a power outage the rechargeable battery can operate the garage door for one to two days. The battery continually charges when the opener is connected to an AC outlet as well and reaches full charge within 24 hours.

I can't stress enough that upgrading your garage door opener is not a task to take lightly. Even with the help of CNET's crack technical editor Steve Conaway (and his impressive bag of tools), I ran into trouble and a few frustrating setbacks.

My original 30-year-old openers and drivetrain tracks were about 6 inches longer than the new Chamberlain hardware. This forced me to reposition the ceiling mounting brackets, including drilling more holes, closer to each of my garage doors.

Also, the new Chamberlain optical door sensors were not physically compatible with my existing brackets. To solve the issue we had to drill holes and mount the sensors to my garage's concrete floor.

Thankfully activating the Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener's smart home features are much easier than the machine's physical setup. First I confirmed that the inside of my garage has a strong wireless signal from my home network router. Next I kicked the opener into ""Wi-Fi learning mode"" by pressing a small yellow button on its control panel (located on the right-hand side next to its light bulb socket). This caused the machine to broadcast its own wireless network signal.

I used a mobile device to join this network then navigate to Chamberlain's MyQ setup website. In my case my test device was a Nexus 6 smartphone running Android Lollipop. After punching in the serial number for the opener it successfully connected to my Wi-Fi network on the first try. Lastly I downloaded the Android version of the MyQ app from the Google Play Store (there's a MyQ for  iOS as well) and created a MyQ account. I was able to link the second opener unit in a similarly swift fashion.

Adding the garage door openers properly to the MyQ app itself, however, wasn't quite as intuitive. For example, while it wasn't difficult to create a profile for each opener independently, seeing both listed within the app and on the same location screen didn't happen automatically. In fact even if I specified an identical ""Home"" location for both openers, often the application created two ""Home"" profiles (each with just a sole opener) instead of combining them.

Another pain is that once you've added them there's no way to move device icons around, through a simple drag and drop, if you'd like one opener to display to the left or right of another.

As for controlling the openers, I'm happy to say it's simple. Tapping an opener icon either tells the door to open or close. And just like other MyQ products, in the interest of safety when a door receives the command to close remotely it will first beep loudly while flashing its lights for 9 seconds. Only after this will the door begin to roll shut.

The MyQ application also offers the choice of pushing email or app notifications whenever your garage doors open and close. You have the option of selecting the timeframe for when you'd like these alerts to happen or to simply turn them off entirely.

This is the feature I find most useful. Alerts are prompt and time-stamped, giving me a quick heads-up when my wife comes and goes or helps build a history of when I enter and leave the house. The notifications arrive not only on my phone but also my Android Wear watch too (a Moto 360).

Chamberlain has also enabled MyQ to link up with other devices from the growing number of smart home platforms. Specifically the app lists options for integrating with Google's Nest thermostats and Wink devices. The company has announced plans to support Apple HomeKit products too, but at the moment there's no evidence of this within the MyQ application.

While I think the chances are rare that I'd actually leave the garage door wide open before I go on vacation, it's nice to have the peace of mind that I can correct the situation remotely.

That said, no matter how easy Chamberlain claims swapping garage door openers might be, it's not a challenge for the inexperienced. Home-repair newbies should also think twice before making this attempt. I'd only recommend the device to those confident of their abilities and seeking to upgrade a sorely outdated garage system. For others not in this position, a better choice is the $99  Chamberlain MyQ Garage . The add-on device brings all the same MyQ abilities to existing door openers.

An alternate route is to have a professional installer do the heavy lifting for you. Since Chamberlain doesn't provide its own network of install pros, unlike competitor Liftmaster, you'll likely have to ask a big-box retailer such as Home Depot or Lowes to tackle the job. A local Home Depot rep I called quoted $127 for the service while the Lowes website states a $119 price for ""basic installation"".

Priced at $268 for the top model, this product isn't exactly an impulse buy either. Even so, the non-Wi-Fi Chamberlain model is oddly $1 more ($269). I have yet to find as powerful a model or even one with Wi-Fi built in from Liftmaster or Genie either. Also consider that people tend to hang on to their garage systems for many years if not decades. Which is why I feel splurging on a machine like this is a wise decision and the Chamberlain Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener fits the bill nicely."
Peeple gives your peephole security camera smarts|"

With various  smart doorbells  and  locks  already on the market, it was only a matter of time before someone came up with the idea of a smart peephole. To be fair, the Peeple -- a product that's currently in the midst of a Kickstarter campaign that's only shipping to the US, Canada and Mexico -- isn't exactly a smart peephole, but it does repurpose your existing one in a pretty clever way.

The Peeple is a disc-shaped device that's designed to attach to the inside of your door, either to a peephole or to glass. It's battery-powered and is equipped with a camera as well as motion and movement sensors. (The team says that it's easy to detach if you want to peer through your peephole the old-fashioned way.)

Since the Peeple is Wi-Fi-enabled and works in tandem with Android and iOS apps, it's supposed to send you an alert whenever someone knocks on or opens your door. And, it should work whether you're on your home network or on a distant cellular or Wi-Fi network.

Like the Ring and SkyBell doorbells, the Peeple lets you see who's at your door by checking your phone. It's also supposed to keep an activity log so you can review various events to see what happened when.

Early backers were able snag a Peeple for just $99, but that tier has since sold out. Now, you'll have to hand over at least $149 to get one.

That converts to about £100 or AU$195, but the product isn't currently available outside of the US, Canada and Mexico, and some tiers don't ship to Mexico, so make sure to visit the Kickstarter page for more details. Shipping is slated for May 2016."
Cut down on home energy costs by tracking devices with Ecoisme|"

Using a  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch  or a similar energy-tracking smart plug has its uses, but what if you want to monitor all of the electronic devices in your home rather than just one?

Poland-based startup Ecoisme has launched a product on Indiegogo -- also called Ecoisme -- that claims to do just that.

Like  Neurio  and  Belkin's upcoming Echo technology  -- other whole-home energy management systems -- Ecoisme hooks up to the main switch in your circuit breaker. This is where the tech lingo starts to take over a bit, but the gist is that it can supposedly detect basic gizmos like your desk fan or electric kettle using power analysis. Basically, that means that it can pick up on unique identifiers based on voltage and current readings.

For more complex appliances, Ecoisme relies on spectrum analysis, a technology that's supposed to pick up on ""noise"" in the electrical network and use that not only to distinguish between your TV and your laptop, but also between brands within the same product category.

Ecoisme should automatically identify most of your devices, but you will also be able to add additional ones manually as needed on the companion Android or iOS app and on its Web interface. Once setup, you should be able to watch over your energy consumption from your phone or computer.

In addition to giving you a wide-angle view of your home electrical usage complete with money-saving tips, Ecoisme is also supposed to issue alerts when something seems awry. So if you accidentally leave the fridge door open, Ecoisme should notice and tell you to close it. The team also has plans to integrate with companies such as  Nest ,  Philips  and Belkin WeMo as well as solar panels.

It's interesting that Ecoisme will work with Belkin, as its upcoming Echo products will compete directly with Ecoisme's new device. Belkin has a long established channel on IFTTT, giving you plenty of options for connecting devices to a larger smart home, and its upcoming Echo system has additional functionality -- a separate device with the same Echo tech can monitor water usage after you hook it to the pipe beneath your sink. Ecoisme, then, will need to be pretty slick to beat the maker of the Insight switch at its own game.

Ecoisme's $99 device (that converts to £65 or AU$130) is available internationally and expected to ship to backers next spring. At time of writing, the campaign had raised over $45,000 of its $50,000 goal, although this is a ""Flexible Funding"" project, so Ecoisme will receive all of the money it raises whether or not it hits that target."
Lutron Caséta Wireless Lighting Starter Kit review:|"

Lutron hasn't been a very vocal partner of Apple's HomeKit home automation system, but all that changed with this week's retail launch of the $230 Caséta Wireless Lighting Starter Kit. It comes complete with a Siri-enabled Smart Bridge hub, two plug-in light dimmer modules, two remote controls and an iOS app for your phone, tablet and Apple Watch. (UK and Australian availability has yet to be announced, but the US price converts to around £150 or AU$295.)

Although this is just the first piece of HomeKit hardware to see the light of day, it's surprisingly full-featured, responsive and simple to use. I was able to control plug-in lamps with dimmable LEDs using Siri, the mobile app and the Apple Watch with only a couple of minor setbacks. From setting up the hardware to telling Siri to ""Turn on the lights,"" the entire experience was a true pleasure.

$230 is a lot to spend for a couple of dimmers, but Lutron's streamlined HomeKit solution is recommended if you're an iOS adherent looking to dive into home automation.

Lutron's hardware works exceptionally well, but it's the least interesting thing about this kit. We already reviewed  	 the original Lutron Smart Bridge  last year with the same two-outlet plug-in dimmers and remotes.

This new HomeKit-exclusive hub looks pretty much the same as, if not identical to, the original. It's a slab of white plastic that connects to your router and helps translate Clear Connect to lighting accessories, so you can dim your LED, halogen and incandescent bulbs, set schedules and more via the companion Lutron Android or iOS app. That's where things start to get interesting.

You can still find  	the original Smart Bridge hub on Amazon for $120 as a standalone device (although it will be phased out soon) and  	plug-in dimmer and remote kits for 60 bucks each. That's $240 for the original hub and the same accessories -- $10 more than this new kit with the HomeKit-specific hub, two dimmers and two remotes. I really liked the original hub, but this second generation one offers a lot more features (but only if you're an iOS devotee).

Lutron told us that this kit would be in Apple Stores throughout North and South America (with the exception of Brazil) as well as on Amazon starting June 2, but we were unable to find them in our local store in Louisville, KY. It wasn't available in any other stores in the surrounding area, nor even in the NY Apple stores as of this writing. The company ended up sending us a kit directly instead. That means that you may not be able to find this kit right away, but it should be en route to an Apple Store near you soon.

Although Lutron has updated its app to account for Siri integration since I reviewed the original hub and accessories, setting everything up works roughly the same as it did before. Connect the Smart Bridge to the router and follow the instructions on the app to pair any accessories. Since this kit comes with two plug-in dimmers and two remotes, I followed the instructions to pair those specific products.

This was really straightforward, with one small exception. To pair the dimmers and the remotes, you have to press and hold their ""off"" buttons until the LED indicator starts blinking rapidly (as pictured above). If you don't press it in exactly the right spot and in exactly the right way, it won't work. And if you want to reset one of the accessories, you have to follow a series of overly complicated rhythmic button presses that border on ridiculous. Setup was simple otherwise, though.

There are a lot of ways to approach this system, but it's very basic at its core. You can plug up to two lamps into a single module and each module has its own built-in controls. So where you can only control a  	 Belkin WeMo Insight Switch  from the WeMo app (or through another software platform, like  	 IFTTT), you can actually turn your lamps on or off and even dim them from the Lutron plug itself. The paired remotes act as an extension of that functionality too.

Then, you have the Lutron app. Forgetting any of the HomeKit features for the moment, the app is very comprehensive, allowing for a whole host of custom schedules and scenes as well as standard on, off and dimmer capabilities. This gives you the opportunity to interact with your lighting whether you're connected to your home network or on a distant cellular or Wi-Fi network.

I particularly liked its geofencing feature; it worked flawlessly. You can set it to automatically turn your lights off when you leave and on when you return and even adjust the distance threshold. There's also an option you can set that will only turn your lights on if you return home after sunset. In general, though, accessing the lights from the plugs, the remotes and the app all work remarkably well. They are reliable, responsive and straightforward, even when I tested with a handful of different dimmable LED brands and models.

Lutron also has a Caséta Wireless IFTTT channel so you can connect third-party devices like the  Nest Learning Thermostat , Nest Protect and others.

The new hub diverges from the original because of its HomeKit exclusivity. It offers Siri integration as well as additional remote access via the Apple Watch.

Depending on your smart home interests, that could seem limiting, but voice control and wearables integration add a lot of functionality that you just can't get with the original -- or really with any other smart home product that we've reviewed. Still, these are bonus features that wouldn't matter nearly as much if the Lutron hardware and app weren't already so solid.

Beyond Lutron's general impressiveness, Siri was similarly responsive when I queried her to turn on, off or dim one or both of the lights, which I was able to customize by room (bedroom, living room) and zone (upstairs, downstairs). Unfortunately, that didn't extend to remote Siri access. You can access the Lutron app outside of your home network, but you need a third-generation Apple TV for Siri to communicate with the devices remotely. So, while you could turn a light on from a cellular network using the app, you must have the Apple TV for Siri to turn a light on via your iPhone.

An Apple support page confirms all of this: ""If you have an Apple TV (third generation or later) with software version 7.0 or later, you can control your HomeKit-enabled accessories when you're away from home using your iOS device. Sign in with the same Apple ID on your iOS device and Apple TV, and you'll be able to use Siri commands to remotely control your accessories.""

I grabbed a $69 (£59, AU$109) third-gen Apple TV and tried it out. After logging in with the same Apple ID, it worked flawlessly. At first. Then, it stopped abruptly. I checked that there was nothing wonky with the Wi-Fi network and that all of the firmware was up-to-date, but saw no obvious issues. Interestingly, logging out and signing back in caused the functionality to return sometimes, but not consistently enough for it to be a legitimate fix.

The Apple Watch version of the Lutron app has fewer features, but you can still access various lighting settings with ease. You can also use Siri on the Apple Watch, although this process was a little more involved than I would like.

The Siri that lives on the Apple Watch can promptly reply to weather inquiries and handle basic commands, but certain questions are too complicated and must be ""handed off"" to an iPhone; the feature is literally called ""Handoff."" Lutron-related commands fall under this category, so asking Siri to ""Turn off the bedroom light"" returns a little text block that reads, ""I can help you control your home when you use Handoff on your iPhone.""

In this case, Handoff manifests as a tiny Siri icon on the bottom left of the iPhone lock screen. Simply swipe up from the icon and Siri will complete the command. Since the iPhone and the Apple Watch need to be within close proximity of one another for most watch features to work, this isn't a huge complication. But it's still way more complicated than it should be.

We have reviewed several plug-in modules (some of which can control more than lights, like Belkin's WeMo switches), but none of them have had dimming capabilities or Lutron's level of responsiveness. Add on the Siri voice control and Apple Watch integration of Lutron's new HomeKit-compatible Smart Bridge and this $230 kit's superiority becomes apparent.

Even so, I still have some questions about using the Apple TV for remote Siri access and really wish the Handoff feature wasn't an Apple Watch necessity. But, that's only a small part of Lutron's HomeKit functionality and HomeKit itself is only a small part of the dimmer kit's overall value. I highly recommend this product if you're an iOS user in search of a solid smart lighting solution."
GE Bright Stik LED review:|"

It's been a busy year in the lighting aisle, with the debut of new, low-cost LED light bulbs that promise to cut your home's power draw without breaking the bank. The newest, from GE, is the Bright Stik LED, which bucks the bulb altogether in favor of a push-pop-shaped build. The cost: $10 for a three-pack (a GE representative tells me that they don't plan on selling the bulbs individually just yet).

Like the other major player on the cheap end of the spectrum, the  Philips 60W Replacement LED , the Bright Stik offers a pretty compelling value proposition. While a 60W incandescent will add about $7 per year to your power bill, the 10W Bright Stik will add just $1.20. Spend $10 on that three-pack and use them for a year, and your total cost is $13.60. Spend a buck on three incandescents, and you'll end up spending another $21 over the course of the year -- and then you'll need to replace them, since that's about as long as they last. The Bright Stiks will last well over a decade.

There are a few trade-offs, though. The Bright Stik isn't quite as bright or as efficient as other LEDs and, like the Philips bulb, it isn't an option that'll work with dimmer switches. Still, it's a very solid fit for basic lighting setups, and at a cost of about $3 per bulb (or, um,""Stik""), it's a very solid value, too. If I just needed to replace one light, I'd probably stick with Philips, but if I'm replacing my bulbs in bulk, I'm going to give the Bright Stik some serious consideration.

The GE Bright Stik isn't the first big brand LED that wants you to think outside the bulb. For over a year now,  the flattened-down Philips SlimStyle LED  has been selling on Home Depot shelves, and its success might serve as proof of concept for the odd-looking Bright Stik LED. You'll soon see the two selling side-by-side in the Home Depot lighting aisle.

Still, the SlimStyle LED at least attempts to approximate the overall silhouette of a light bulb (from certain angles, anyway). With the Bright Stik LED, you're all in on newfangled design, no incandescent nostalgia necessary. Whether or not that's a good thing is entirely up to you.

We're probably missing the point, though. Bulb or no bulb, the Bright Stik is still, well, a light bulb. In most cases, you're not going to see the thing after you screw it in and lower the lampshade. The form factor really doesn't matter much in and of itself.

What does matter is how that form factor impacts the quality of light, which is where my concerns lied as I prepared to test the Bright Stik out. None of that cylindrical plastic is angled downward,  the way the bottom half of a spherical bulb is. I wondered if that might keep the Bright Stik from casting the sort of downward light people typically prefer to read under.

Fortunately, that wasn't the case. With the LED hidden under a lampshade, I couldn't distinguish the quality of the Bright Stik's light from any other standard, omnidirectional bulb.

That applies to the look and feel of the light, too. At 2,850 K, it's as warm and yellowy as you'd expect from a standard, household light (a 5,000 K ""daylight"" version is available, too, for an extra buck). The 760-lumen light output -- while a bit short of the ideal 800 lumen benchmark for a 60W replacement -- is plenty bright for most basic needs.

Really, the only difference this design makes is on GE's end -- the slimmed down figure makes it a breeze to package the Bright Stik, and easier for GE to ship them in bulk (especially when packaged three at a time). All of that helps shave cents off the upfront cost, and there's nothing to not like about that.

The GE Bright Stik holds its own when compared with LEDs that cost two or three times as much per bulb, but not without a few compromises. As said before, at 760 lumens (we clocked it a little above that, at 786), it's a bit less bright than most other 60W replacement options. It's also not the most efficient LED money can buy, with a 10W power draw and a good-not-great efficacy score of 79 lumens per watt.

The Bright Stik is also non-dimmable, which might make it a non-starter if you like being able to dial the lights down low. Try dialing the Bright Stik down, and you'll see quite a bit of flicker -- it just isn't built to handle common dimmer switch mechanics.

That's the same trade-off that you'll get with its main competitor, the $5  Philips 60W Replacement LED . Both are non-dimmable, low-cost options, though they're separated by a few fine points. The Philips bulb is brighter and more efficient, while the Bright Stik lasts longer, and offers a longer warranty. Both bulbs are brighter than the underwhelming 658 lumens that you'll get with the $5  Ikea Ledare LED , though to that bulb's credit, it offers a surprisingly high color rendering score of 88, and works with dimmers, too.

On the GE side, the color rendering score sits at 81, a point better than Philips. The color rendering index is a scale from 0 to 100 that tells you how good a light source is at making colors look accurate and vivid. Higher-scores are better, so GE gets the edge here, but it's a largely indistinguishable one -- anything less than 85 is more or less par for the course as far as LEDs are concerned.

None of these specs jump off of the page. Category for category, the Bright Stik sits in the middle of the pack, or towards the bottom. Still, there are no glaring shortcomings, either. I wish it were brighter, but it's bright enough. I wish it were more efficient, but it's efficient enough. I wish the color rendering score were higher, but it's high enough.

The number that matters is the price, and that's where GE has the real edge. No other big brand LED on sale today can claim an upfront cost that's locked in as low as the Bright Stik. It also offers the longest warranty we've seen from any LED priced below the $10 level. The Bright Stik might not outperform its competitors, but it beats all of them outright when it comes to value.

In the end, I think the Bright Stik's value is going to win out with consumers. At $10 for a three-pack -- just over $3 per bulb -- there's not much stopping them from giving it a shot. And, unless those consumers are expecting dimmability, I don't see much of anything that's going to leave them disappointed.

Spec for spec, there are better bulbs out there. I certainly wouldn't blame anyone for spending an extra $2 for the uptick in brightness and efficiency that comes with the  Philips 60W Replacement , and spending a little more still for a dimmable bulb that dims well, like the  Cree 4Flow LED  or the  Osram 60W Replacement LED , makes sense, too. But dollar for dollar, the Bright Stik raises the bar on value. It's going to be a contender."
Philips 60W Replacement LED review:|"

If you've been waiting for the right time to upgrade to LEDs, things are starting to get pretty compelling. Case in point: the newest 60W replacement bulb from Philips, which costs just $5 at Home Depot -- no utility rebates necessary.

That's as cheap an LED as we've seen from the big brands, and with an 800-lumen light output from a power draw of just 8.5 watts, it's an especially efficient performer, too. Replace your incandescents with them, and you'll have a tough time telling the difference -- at least until you get your next power bill.

This isn't a bulb without compromises, though. Unlike the majority of LEDs, which are rated to light up for 20 years or more, the Philips bulb only promises 10. It also isn't rated for use with dimmer switches, so if you like to dial the light down low without flicker or buzz, you'll need to look elsewhere. But for basic, everyday home lighting, it's a very safe pick, and a borderline no-brainer in the lighting aisle.

There's nothing terribly high-concept about this bulb's build, because that's exactly what it is: a bulb. That bucks a recent trend of LEDs with reinvented shapes, including Philips' own flattened down  SlimStyle LED , which, until the arrival of this new 60W replacement, was the brand's most budget-friendly LED.

The new bulb gives Philips a new price tier beneath the SlimStyle's $5-$10 range, and Philips separates the two with dimmability -- the StyleStyle has it, the new bulb doesn't. If you weren't planning on dimming your lights anyway, then the new bulb should make a lot of sense. On the other hand, if your home has dimmer switches and you like being able to dial the lights up and down without flicker or buzz, then you'll want to look elsewhere (and potentially avoid the SlimStyle, too -- it didn't do too well  when we tested out dimmable LEDs).

Aside from the nondimmable design, the specs are right where you'd want them for a 60W replacement LED. The bulb claims a light output of 800 lumens at a warm, familiar color temperature of 2,700 K. It also draws just 8.5 watts of power. Run it for 3 hours a day, and it'll tack just over $1 onto your yearly energy bill. A typical 60W replacement fluorescent will cost closer to $2 per year to run, while a 60w incandescent will cost over $7.

The math comes down in favor of this LED. At $5 upfront and with a yearly operating cost of $1, you're looking at a total year one cost of $6. That's cheaper than using an incandescent you got for free.

Incandescent comparisons aside, the Philips LED's 8.5 watts are lower (and more efficient) than almost every other 60W replacement LED we've tested. The only one that matches it is  Osram's 60W Replacement LED , which sells at Lowe's. I like that bulb quite a bit -- it's plenty bright, it dims like a champ, and it promises twice the lifespan of the Philips LED -- but at $10, it also costs twice as much.

In sum, the value proposition here is quite strong. For $5 per bulb (or less, if you catch the introductory two-for-one pricing at Home Depot), you're getting an LED that holds its own against some impressive competitors, and one that beats them outright when it comes to the upfront cost.

We don't just take the numbers on the box at their word, mind you. We test them out for ourselves inside of our integrating sphere -- really just a big hollow ball with a reflective interior. The light bulb sits in the center, with a divider separating it from our spectrometer's eye. With the light scattered evenly throughout the sphere, we can get very accurate lumen, color temperature and color rendering index readings.

Let's start with the color temperature. Philips rates the new LED at 2,700 K, the same as the majority of bulbs on the market today. When we tested the bulb out, it came as close to perfect as you can get, with a reading of 2,701 K. There's also a daylight version of the bulb that shines at 5,000 K -- though it's currently out of stock online, and doesn't appear eligible for the two-for-one deal at Home Depot.

The bulb scored well when we calculated the lumen output, too, scoring at 821 -- comfortably above 800. I also appreciated the near-spherical bulb design, which helps ensure that plenty of that light shines downward. That sort of omnidirectional thinking means that this bulb would work well in something like a bedside reading lamp, where downward-angled light is key.

As for the color rendering index, which offers an indication of how accurately a bulb will illuminate colors, the Philips LED sits on par with the competition at a very average score of 80. That's fine for a budget-priced light, but it's worth noting that the  Ikea Ledare LED  -- another 5-buck bulb -- scored an impressive 88. Costlier options like the  Cree TW Series LED  and the  GE Reveal line of LEDs  score up into the 90s, and  can help colors look even more vivid.

Even though this is a nondimmable LED, I tried dimming it anyway. The results were actually a lot better than I expected. Most nondimmable LEDs will strobe and flash when you try to dim them, but I was able to dial the Philips LED up and down on all of our switches with a mostly moderate degree of flicker and buzz. It isn't a level of dimmability that I'd want to live with day in and day out, but it's an interesting result nonetheless.

The other consideration is the lifespan. Philips promises 10,000 hours -- about 10 years at 3 hours per day. That's obviously a lot better than you'll get from an incandescent, but it's underwhelming among LEDs, where 25,000 hours (well over 20 years) is the norm.

At 5 bucks, the Philips 60W Replacement LED is an undeniably strong value, and one that gets the important things -- efficiency and basic light quality -- almost exactly right. You'll need to accept the non-dimmable design and the shorter lifespan, but I think both are fair compromises at the price.

If you need your bulb to dim, I recommend turning to the $10  Osram 60W Replacement LED  or the $8  Cree 4Flow LED , both of which aced our dimming tests. Otherwise, this Philips bulb is a smart bet, and a low-risk starting point if you're thinking of making the switch to LEDs."
Bitfinder's Awair helps ID harmful stuff in the air|"

Pollution, allergens and other harmful particles make indoor and outdoor air quality a concern for many. Still, it isn't exactly easy to pinpoint the specific stuff in the air that might be giving you a hard time. And even if you could, there aren't a lot of ways to improve the situation short of a whole-home HEPA filter or something similarly extreme.

Enter the Bitfinder Awair, an unassuming little countertop device packed full of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), dust (PM2.5) and volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors. Not only is this $149 gizmo supposed to sniff out your air quality problem areas, its companion app is designed to alert you whenever something's amiss.

But that's not where Awair's smart-home capabilities stop. The app can also supposedly take note of your particular health issues and send you related suggestions so you'll feel better without having to do anything too drastic.

Bitfinder says that the W-Fi-enabled Awair can work with third-party products such as the  Misfit Shine  and  Philips Hue LEDs  and that an additional hardware component combined with its open API software can transform the dumb humidifiers or purifiers that you might already have at home into smart appliances. It also has plans to partner with  Works with Nest and  IFTTT.

We haven't seen anything quite like Bitfinder's Awair, although Dyson, Withings and other key brands are placing importance on air quality. Earlier this year, Dyson introduced the  Pure Cool , an air-purifying fan and the widely-available $200, £170  Withings Home  security camera is equipped with VOC sensors so it can keep track of your health while it's watching over your security.

Awair is available for pre-order today for $149 (at the current exchange rate, that's roughly £100 and AU$195). The price will jump up to $199 (£130, AU$250) after the pre-order period ends and it's expected to start shipping internationally early fall."
Universal smart-home control packed into Nuimo's innocuous disc|"

Nuimo wants to move the focal point of your smart home away from your smartphone. The disc shaped controller from tech startup Senic will allow you to have fun with tech without being glued to a screen.

Theoretically compatible with any  Bluetooth Low Energy device, and already boasting more than 30 integrations with other devices and apps, you can supposedly click Nuimo to turn your  Philips Hue  lights on, rotate its outer dial to change the volume of your  Sonos  speaker, or swipe across its surface to set your  Nest  thermostat.

Nuimo is an all-in-one smart home controller with ready made functionality for a wide variety of smart home and entertainment devices, and it lets you control one or many simultaneously through its clever foursome of inputs. In addition to the click, turn, and swipe, you can gesture across the surface or up and down toward it. It'll use its infrared sensors to track your motion and respond accordingly.

Each of these inputs can be mapped to the controls of any compatible app or device. You'll have to do some setup on your smartphone to get started, and any customization of gestures will happen via the app, but then, you should be able to put your phone aside and use Nuimo as a remote control for your smart home.

Currently being funded on Kickstarter, some pre-order discounts are still available for Nuimo. Senic is a German company, so the prices are listed in euros, with the US dollar approximation displayed underneath. At retail, the price will be around $200, which translates roughly to £129 and AU$252 in the UK and Australia.

Nuimo will only be shipped to certain countries, and the Kickstarter page doesn't list which ones, but the US pricing gives a clear indication it's intended for the States, and going to the UK shouldn't be a big stretch from Germany since Senic is planning to ship internationally anyway.

Currently, the possibilities of using this little puck as a central smart-home interface has me excited. It's listed Nest, Philips Hue,  Lockitron,  WeMo ,  SmartThings  and others as compatible brands, with  Soundcloud, Spotify, Youtube, and  Netflix among compatible apps.

With each device, you can use the different input possibilities for detailed controls. One of the promo videos shows you can dim lights with the wheel, and change to different preset colors with a swipe. In theory, you can train each of the inputs to interact with a different device, so you can multitask seamlessly.

You can also switch between your available devices by long pressing to open a quick access menu, and scrolling between your options with swipes. The top of Nuimo uses LEDs to display the symbol for your selection, so if it works as planned, you'll be able to autonomously manage a number of different options once setup is complete without ever having to pull out your phone.

Some of my excitement for Nuimo is tempered by the fact that it's currently undergoing its second crowdfunding campaign. Late last year, Senic used IndieGogo to garner funds for a product then called Flow. The campaign was a success. In fact, Senic raised more than five times its monetary goal.

Thankfully, Nuimo's current campaign acknowledges the previous one, and says that money helped improve the hardware. Yet the new device images don't look much different, and the reason given for both campaigns has been hardware cost and device certification.

Nuimo lists more integrations than Flow did, so Senic looks to have made some improvements, but a second campaign certainly lends doubt to the company's ability to estimate costs, at the very least. Not that Nuimo smells like a scam,  crowdfunded products are often delayed, and manufacturing costs can change. In fact, Senic hasn't yet missed the first expected delivery date for the initial Indiegogo backers.

Those dates are staggered from June to August, so Senic is smartly allowing time for multiple batches of production. Ordering now on Kickstarter gets you an expected due date of October.

Delays could be on the way, especially if Senic is still locking down material and assembly costs. Once Nuimo does arrive, it will need responsive controls and near instantaneous device reaction to convince people to step away from the phone. It's promising a lot, and thus has a lot to prove to meet expectations and be the smart home controller we're looking for."
The Planty smart pot aims for total connected care|"

I've called a couple of my former houseplants ""Planty."" Despite the personality imbued by the name, I ended up killing all of my own Planties due to accidental neglect. So, both the name and the concept of the new connected planter, Planty, from garden tech startup Nthing, struck a chord with me.

Via its sensors and Wi-Fi connection, Planty can monitor the light, temperature and humidity near your own green-leafed friend, whatever it might be named. Planty will send you push notifications to its iOS or Android app should your plant need attention. Better yet, it'll take care of the most common maintenance task itself. Planty includes a water reservoir, so it knows when your flower or herb is thirsty and can do something about it.

And yes, the app lets you put whatever nickname you have for your plant into the dashboard, so if you want Planty the planter monitoring Planty the basil plant, now you can. Well, you can soon; Nthing is currently raising funds for manufacturing its smart planters on Kickstarter. You can preorder now for $100 with an estimated delivery date of November.

After fulfilling the preorders, Nthing plans to have Planty ready for retail in January 2016 with a price of $150. The company has promised to ship Planty en masse to the US, UK and Australia. No word yet on exact international pricing, but the US price translates roughly to £95 and AU$185 for our overseas readers.

The planter itself doesn't hold the same charm for me as the name. It's an all-white cylinder that you'll need to charge via it's USB cable. At the very least, it's inoffensive, if a little bland. Nthing promises the planter will light up so you can see the status of your flowers at a glance, but I've yet to see any images of that. Hopefully, it'll add a little personality without being gaudy.

The app looks reasonably intuitive. It's an updated version of the Life app, which was a smart gardening journal and the first project of Nthing. The main screen gives you a few options such as ""control"" to manually water your plant, ""dashboard"" to do a status check, and ""recipe"" for sharing tips with the community.

I'm a fan of fewer clicks, so I'd have appreciated a way to water and see the status right from the app's home page, but having extra organizational buckets might prove useful should you have multiple plants you're trying to track and maintain.

When it is time to water, Planty will draw from its 500mL reservoir. That's plenty for a couple of waterings, but certainly not enough volume to allow you to forget your plant for long stretches. The spouts look well designed, placed around the upper rim so they can distribute moisture on all sides of the roots.

The popular self-watering planter brand Lechuza offers plenty of models that can do the same basic task, including varieties that can be had for as little as $30. Planty gets a leg up with its other sensors and alerts, but even with that extra functionality, it's hard to justify paying five times as much.

A  Parrot Flower Power  can tell you about those extra factors, and it only costs $60, so you could package a Flower Power to put in the soil of your low-end Lechuza and still save $60 off of Planty's eventual retail price.

Closer to its price point, you'll find a few self-contained solutions, like the $129 to $249 Modern Sprout or the $199 to $499 Windowfarm. Both of those have a completely self-contained ecosystem through hydroponics, so they take care of nutrients -- Nthing's product doesn't look to help you track fertilizer.

Modern Sprout and WindowFarm also let you grow multiple things at once. Planty is a one-plant-at-a-time kind of pot. The most comparable smart pot is the $80  Click & Grow . It's a single-plant system, takes care of its own nutrients and it ships with its own specially designed light source.

Planty certainly seems like a step up from your average clay pot, but it'll have trouble holding its own against an already established field of smart-planting competition, especially given its lofty price.

The one hope of redemption it brings is its potential to connect to a larger smart home. Planty's Kickstarter page claims you can use its app to control  Philips bulbs , the  Nest Thermostat , and  connected switches. I've reached out to Nthing to see how it makes these connections, but the idea is certainly promising. Your plant can actually turn up the heat or the lights if it needs more of either resource.

Since Planty is Wi-Fi only, it'll have to get data from the cloud, as opposed to interfacing with the devices directly. The system will also have to strike a delicate balance between automating plant care and making you uncomfortable by changing the thermostat without your permission.

Planty will have to find a way to make this interconnectivity work and work well to stand out in an increasingly competitive field. It looks smartly designed, but for me to choose this Planty planter to save my own Planty plant, it'll have to prove it's worth the price."
The GreenIQ Smart Garden Hub brings friends to the connected yard|"

Editors' note, January 11, 2016: GreenIQ introduced a new look hub at CES 2016. The piece has been updated accordingly.

Smart gardening tools have made it easy to get the great outdoors hooked up to the Internet. We've seen plenty of connected  plant sensors,  weather monitors , and  sprinkler controls , and now Israeli startup GreenIQ Hub wants its Smart Garden Hub to control all three.

The third version of the GreenIQ Hub can't do this all on its own. First and foremost, it's a smart sprinkler controller that replaces your existing box and can manage up to sixteen zones (up from the six zones of the first generation GreenIQ). Like the  Rachio Iro  and the  Blossom Smart Watering Controller , it monitors the weather and uses that information to help you manage your watering schedule. If it's going to rain, the sprinklers won't run. If it's particularly dry and hot, they'll run more.

GreenIQ sets itself apart with its communication capabilities. It connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi -- standard stuff -- or through a cellular signal. GreenIQ can also access AT&T's 3G signal. It's the only smart irrigation controller with this option. And it can communicate with other smart devices via its open API, its channel on  IFTTT or a direct interface.

GreenIQ previously announced collaboration with the  Parrot Flower Power  and the  Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor. In theory, you can use the moisture and temperature readings from these connected plant sensors to help your sprinkler system be that much more accurate.

GreenIQ can also directly communicate with the  Netatmo Urban Weather Station , so you won't have to rely on weather predictions for your general area. Instead, you can use the weather readings right from your backyard to guide your sprinkler.

With the help of its partners, GreenIQ stands to be the most informed smart sprinkler controller out there. GreenIQ will even have a flow meter allowing you to measure the precise amount of water used. Whether that makes an actual difference remains to be seen. GreenIQ has promised as much as 50 percent savings on your water bill compared with standard, non-smart controllers.

The GreenIQ Smart Garden Hub costs $249 and is available worldwide with free shipping via the GreenIQ site. It has an iOS app and an Android app. The price converts to approximately £165 and AU$320 for those in the UK and Australia, respectively. It's also available online at Home Depot.

Looking closer at the competition, the Rachio Iro gives you eight zones instead of six for the same price, and also costs $249. The Iro also comes in a 16-zone version for $299, and it has its own IFTTT channel. Parrot and Netatmo have IFTTT channels as well.

You might not be getting a large advantage via the direct connections between those devices and the GreenIQ Hub. Parrot can only communicate via Bluetooth and thus needs your phone or tablet to come into range to send its data to the cloud. If the GreenIQ could help bridge that gap, so it could talk to your garden without you remembering to take a trip out there, that would be pretty significant.

As it stands, the information from the GreenIQ Hub and any of its partners only meets up once it all arrives at the cloud. I'm doubtful that it could get any more info out of a Parrot Flower Power or Netatmo Weather Station than you could send to Rachio via IFTTT.

The Blossom Smart Watering Control offers a cheaper alternative, selling for $199 and covering 12 zones. It's not as advanced at interoperability as either the GreenIQ Hub or the Rachio Iro, but it communicates through power line, using the wires of your home, in addition to Wi-Fi for a theoretically stronger signal over a greater distance.

Both the Blossom and the GreenIQ Hub are waterproof. The Rachio Iro isn't. All three allow you to set custom schedules via an iOS or Android app and also allow you to use a desktop interface should you choose to forgo a smart device.

Whether the GreenIQ Smart Garden Hub can get enough details from its partners to outdo the Rachio Iro or the Blossom Smart Watering Controller remains to be seen. That said, it bests the Rachio by being waterproof, and it bests the Blossom with interoperability, and it'll soon round out its functionality with a flow meter to detect leaks.

If everything works together as promised, and the devices in its smart garden family really can make a difference over basic weather predictions, it could be the winner of the comparable trio of smart watering controllers. As it stands, it looks primed to be an interesting competitor."
Smart, white light, no hub necessary|"

Color-changing LED light bulbs with built-in smarts can be a lot of fun, but they're largely a novelty -- and too much of a splurge for many consumers. The Lifx White 800 LED looks to address both of those points by cutting out the RGB diodes, focusing on practical, tunable shades of white light, and dropping the price per bulb to $40 -- down from $99 for  	 the original Lifx LED  (the White 800 LED is available in a variety of global voltages and fittings, including a B22 bayonet cap for Europe and Australia. That price comes out to about £25, or AU$50, converted roughly).

It's a similar approach to what Philips did with its  	 Hue Lux LEDs , a white-light-only follow-up to the multicolored Hue bulbs. Philips recently cut its Hue Lux pricing down to $80 for a two-bulb starter kit that comes with the mandatory Hue Bridge and $20 for each additional bulb. At those prices, the Lifx White 800 LED is the better value for a single bulb, but if you want two or more (or if you've already got a Hue Bridge plugged into your router), then Hue Lux might make more sense.

Keep in mind, though, that those Hue Lux LEDs aren't color tunable -- you're locked into a single, warm white color temperature of 2,700K. With Lifx White 800, you can dial into whatever white light shade you like, from low, yellowy tones (2,700K) up to light that's hotter and more bluish (6,500K).

We saw the same color tunability trick when we tested out the  	 Osram Lightify Starter Kit , which includes two bulbs and a mandatory plug-in gateway for $60. It's a subtle feature for sure, but one that we enjoyed, especially once we started automating the lights to shift tones as the day progresses. Higher tones can help you wake up in the morning and keep you feeling active during the day, for instance, while warmer tones can help you unwind and relax before bed. If you're especially design-minded, you'll also enjoy dialing into the exact shade that best compliments your home decor.

Lifx sets its bulbs apart from the majority of the competition -- Philips and Osram included -- by packing Wi-Fi radios directly into each bulb. That eliminates the need for any sort of hub or gateway device. Just screw the bulb in, turn it on, and follow the pairing instructions in the Lifx app.

The new White 800 bulb is currently sold out on the Lifx website, but you can find it on the shelf at Best Buy, so I ran over to the nearest shopping center and picked one up. It looks a lot like the original, albeit with a shorter build. It's also heavy -- not quite as much so as the original, which weighs in at more than 10 ounces, but closer than I would have guessed, punching in at 8.25 ounces.

The White 800 LED doesn't have quite as much oomph as the original Lifx, which shines at about a 75W replacement level. With a max brightness of 890 lumens, the Lifx White 800 is more of a 60W replacement, albeit an impressive one, as most 60W replacement LEDs fall closer to 800 lumens.

Lifx gets you those 890 lumens from a stated power draw of 11 watts, efficient enough to claim about 81 lumens per watt. We'll test those numbers out with our spectrometer, integrating sphere, and variac transformer in good time, and have the full data ready when we write the full review.

On the smarts side, you'll use the same Lifx app as before to control the White 800 LEDs, which means that the same features are at play. There are simple things like a candlelight mode and a strobe function, and very basic scheduling functionality, but nothing terribly unique or innovative.

The true smarts really come into play through the  	Lifx IFTTT channel. With IFTTT, a free, online automation service, you'll be able to sync the White 800 LED to other smart home gadgets and to things like GPS location and sunset. Lifx is also certified through the Works with Nest initiative. Pair your bulb up with a Nest Protect smoke detector, and the lights will come on whenever the smoke detector goes off.

At $40 each, and with no hub or gateway needed, the Lifx White 800 seems well-positioned to tempt buyers who want to try out a single smart bulb. Other smart lighting kits, including Philips and Osram along with  	 Belkin WeMo  and  Connected by TCP  offer a higher cost of entry, though they do get more cost efficient as you add more bulbs to your setup. We'll spend some time with the new bulb and have a better sense of how it stacks up in the coming weeks."
Luxury lux from this Buster + Punch LED|"

Light bulbs have a long utilitarian history, with forms drawn entirely from the function of the filament trapped inside. The ""Buster Bulb"" from the British design label Buster + Punch doesn't shy away from that bulb-shaped backstory, but it also puts form first with a high-end, modern build that's about as slick-looking as anything I've seen. Of course, at £40 each (about $60 or AU$80, roughly converted), that sort of luxury illumination doesn't come cheap.

The centerpiece of the design is the ""resin light pipe"" that runs the vertical length of the bulb's interior. Buster + Punch claims that the pipe diffuses the LED light into a warm, ambient glow while simultaneously providing focused spot lighting for surfaces below.

The Buster Bulb comes housed in a 120mm glass bulb tinted in your choice of crystal, gold, or smoke (not to be confused with silver, gold, or space gray). Each bulb is built off of an E27 screw-in base, with a power draw of 3 watts. Buster + Punch doesn't list brightness specifications on its website and hasn't responded to my inquiry, but at that wattage, I wouldn't expect much more than an accent light of a few hundred lumens, at best.

Buster Bulbs are fully dimmable and rated at a 10,000 hour lifespan. At £40 per bulb, I certainly wish that number were higher -- 25,000 hours is largely the norm for LED bulbs these days.

Buster + Punch claims CE certification throughout Europe for all of its electronics, including the Buster Bulb. The design label claims that it's working on UL certification as well, but can't sell the bulb in North America until that process is complete.

For shoppers in search of an even bigger splurge, Buster + Punch also sells the metallic screw-in fixtures shown in the product photos for £130 each ($195/AU$255). Like the bulbs, the fixtures offer three finishes: steel, smoked bronze and rose copper."
Canary Smart Home Security Device review:|"

If I were a shopper currently in the market for a home security system, I'd be giving Canary a good, close look. With an HD, night-vision camera and a bevy of sensors for things like motion, temperature, and air quality Canary promises to stand guard over the living room and alert your Android or iOS device if anything's amiss, all for $250 and no monthly fees. It's a solid pitch.

That, coupled with a strong marketing push, is why Canary did so well on Indiegogo back in 2013, crowdfunding nearly two million dollars only to follow the effort up with millions more in venture capital  from big names like Khosla Ventures. Canary looked every bit like the real thing, and for those of us in the market for a cheaper, smarter alternative to costly, brand-name security systems, the gadget couldn't get here fast enough.

Well, it's here now, in the living rooms of those Indiegogo backers and on store shelves across the US (Canary isn't shipping internationally just yet, but that price comes out to £170/AU$325, converted roughly). Following a few months of tweaks and firmware updates, many of the initial bugs that held Canary back seem to be more or less resolved, and the 1080p picture quality it offers is right on par with Dropcam.

Canary works as promised, but that doesn't mean that it lives up to its promise of packing complete home security into a single device. There are some glaring shortcomings with how Canary works that keep me from recommending it, especially with worthy competition like  iSmartAlarm's iCamera Keep  and  Piper NV  already on the market. I expect Canary to get better with time as its creators continue to fine-tune the firmware, but if you're buying in today, I'd look elsewhere.

I think that one of the reasons behind Canary's crowdfunding success is that it's a really good-looking gadget. The slick, cylindrical build looks appropriately modern and minimalist in all three colors -- white, black, and grey. It isn't anything close to an eyesore, which is important for a device that needs to be kept out in the open in your living room.

Inside that body is Canary's 1080p night-vision camera, along with the motion sensor that tells it when to start recording; ambient sensors for temperature, humidity and air quality; a 90 dB panic siren; and a Wi-Fi radio to send everything to your Android or iOS device by way of the cloud. A color-changing LED ring on the bottom of the device lets you see what mode it's in at a glance -- green when it's armed, yellow when it's disarmed.

There's a third option, too: Privacy mode. Switch it over, and Canary will essentially go to sleep, ceasing all video and audio recording. Originally, you could only put Canary into Privacy mode manually, but after a recent update, you can set the thing to automatically switch over when it detects you've arrived home, the same as it does with arming and disarming.

For as many features as Canary can claim, it doesn't have everything. Though it boasts a fairly wide, 147-degree angle of view, it won't pan or tilt on command, like  iSmartAlarm's iCamera Keep  will. That camera, along with  Piper NV , will also detect loud noises and then, if needed, sound the alarm -- Canary won't.

Additionally, Canary is currently a walled-off device, with no third-party compatibility to speak of. By comparison, iSmartAlarm can sync up with third-party gadgets  by way of its IFTTT channel, while Piper NV has its own built-in Z-Wave radio to help connect it with things like locks, smart switches and open/closed sensors.

An obvious answer here might seem to be integration with the Nest Learning Thermostat, which could likely put Canary's temperature and humidity sensors to good work. However, Nest already owns Dropcam, and doesn't seem terribly interested in getting cozy with any other connected cameras -- at least not through the year-old Works with Nest initiative, where Dropcam remains your only compatible camera.

I had a rough time getting my Canary up and running when I first previewed the device in January, but I'm happy to report that things have gotten a lot easier in the months since. The process is simple on paper -- just power your Canary, plug it into your phone, and enter your Wi-Fi info into the app.

That second step was my first roadblock last time around. You plug Canary into your phone using a yellow cable that plugs into your headphone jack. From there, Canary will ""listen"" for the Wi-Fi info you enter into the app. In my case though, the gadget couldn't hear my iPhone 5S, even after I followed all of Canary's troubleshooting tips. Finally, I switched over to my iPad, which worked fine.

This time around, I was hoping to be able to get everything set up with just my phone, but that wasn't the case -- the yellow cable problem persisted. Again, I had to jump over to my iPad, where everything worked perfectly. There must be a weird setting on my phone getting in the way of the setup process, but whatever it is, I can't find it, and neither could Canary's troubleshooters.

Once you've paired Canary with your Wi-Fi network, you'll probably need to update the gadget's firmware. This was another sticking point last time, and an even more aggravating one, as I couldn't get the download to work despite repeated attempts and multiple phone calls to Canary's support team. All told, it took a solid day of fiddling before I had Canary up and running.

This time, things went much, much better. The firmware downloaded and updated within a few minutes on my very first attempt, and voila, my Canary was up and running. It's still not a perfect setup process, but it's significantly better than it was, so I give Canary's team credit for making progress.

From the Canary app's home screen, you can tap to view your live video feed or swipe up to see a timeline of past recordings. Canary logs these recordings in both armed and disarmed modes -- you can filter out the disarmed clips with a single tap, leaving only the clips that were logged while the device was armed.

You can also tap on the home screen's temperature and humidity readings to access ""Homehealth"" graphs of the conditions in your home. Testing them out at the office, they offered spot-on readings of the temperature and humidity.

I also tested the third Homehealth graph, which records air quality. The air quality graph doesn't distinguish between different toxins, instead lumping everything together on a graph that charts between ""normal"" and ""very abnormal."" To test the thing out, I plugged Canary into an extension cord, took it outside, and set a lit cigarette down right next to it.

Once it had burned down, I went back inside and checked the graphs. Along with the expected jumps in temperature and humidity, there was a big red spike into ""very abnormal"" territory on the air quality graph. I was impressed.

What's more impressive, though, is Canary's video quality. Compared with iSmartAlarm and Piper NV, it looks the clearest to me by far, offering a strong degree of detail, even in night-vision mode. That last bit is key, as the most crucial video this thing will ever record is the clip of a burglar rummaging through your living room in the dark of the night. If you get their face on camera, you're going to want that image to be as clear as possible.

Canary also claims it'll get smarter the more you use it. The learning mechanism here is a tagging feature -- pull up a clip from your timeline, and you can tag it to tell the system what triggered it. The idea is that eventually, Canary will start to recognize what's happening in a specific clip, and whether or not it's relevant to your security concerns. In theory, that means fewer false alarms the more you use the thing.

Those false alarms aren't as alarming as with other systems, though, because Canary won't automatically sound its siren when the system gets triggered. I thought this was a bit head-scratching when I first previewed the device back in January, and expected that Canary's team would at least introduce auto-siren functionality as an optional feature. They haven't, and now that I've spent more time testing the thing out, I understand why.

Put simply, Canary is hyper-sensitive. Every night of my tests, the system was triggered multiple times by things as simple as a car's headlights passing by. During one night, with Canary set up in the front of our office, the system was triggered 22 times.

Canary won't automatically sound the siren if it's triggered -- a mercy, given how easy it is to set the thing off. Instead, if Canary spots something while armed in the middle of the night, it'll alert your phone, and then you'll have to choose whether or not to sound the alarm yourself. Better hope you don't sleep through that alert.

I tried to combat this issue by tagging aggressively, marking each and every clip as ""Shadows"" and telling the system that everything was fine. I wanted my Canary to calm down and stop flooding me with irrelevant alerts that might ultimately drown out a legitimate one. Over the course of my tests, though, it never got any better and never learned to auto-tag anything. Canary's team tells me that it could take a few more months for devices to get significantly more intelligent, but I have to imagine at least a good percentage of the user base giving up before then.

Another key issue with Canary is that I wouldn't receive alerts when I unplugged the thing. That means a burglar could theoretically yank the cord out before Canary noticed them. They'd need to know where the Canary was in your home and get to it in the dark without being seen -- a stretch, perhaps, but still a clear shortcoming. Bottom line: if my security system goes offline, I want to know about it immediately.

Canary's got a lot of room for improvement, but the good news here is that the bugs are largely gone and the hardware is sound. The camera offers exceptional picture quality both in regular mode and -- more importantly -- in night-vision mode. The Homehealth sensors are helpful and accurate. The motion detector doesn't miss a thing. There's good stuff going on under the hood.

That said, there are still too many frustrations with Canary for me to recommend spending $250 on it over the $270 Piper NV or the $150 iCamera Keep. The over-sensitivity all but renders the thing unusable, and the lack of third-party support will be disappointing to anyone who wants to incorporate their security with a larger smart-home setup. I expect Canary will get better as time goes on, but right now, I'm looking elsewhere for my security needs."
Philips Hue Go puts smart lighting on the move|"

Philips is adding another color-changing smart light to the Hue family this summer, and with a built-in, rechargeable battery, you'll be able to take it with you around the home. Dubbed Philips Hue Go, the hemispherical fixture will retail for $100 when it makes its debut this June.

Sitting about the size of a cereal bowl, the plastic-bodied Philips Hue Go connects wirelessly with the Philips Hue bridge over Zigbee, with controls situated in the Philips Hue app on your Android or iOS device. For quick changes, you can press a button on the bottom of the device to cycle through a handful of preset tones, or sync it up with the  Philips Hue Tap . You'll also be able to integrate it with third-party apps and devices built to work with Hue, including IFTTT.

The Hue Go plugs into the wall using a standard DC jack, but it'll keep shining after you unplug it thanks to the built-in battery. Fully charged, Philips tells us the thing will shine for at least three hours -- more if the brightness isn't dialed all the way up.

Like the original  Philips Hue LED bulbs , the Philips Hue Go boasts a full RGB spectrum of colors to choose from, along with a separate spectrum of white light tones ranging from 2,000K to 6,500K. Plugged in, the Hue Go's LEDs draw just 6 watts and claim to put out 300 lumens at peak brightness -- reasonably bright for an accent light.

This isn't Philips' first foray into smart fixtures. Last year, the brand unveiled  Philips Hue Beyond , a series of high-end fixtures with color-changing smart LEDs built right in. Consider Hue Go to be Beyond's much simpler, much less expensive counterpart.

In addition to the arrival of Hue Go, Philips is also announcing new, lower pricing for its  Philips Hue Lux  line of white-light-only smart LEDs. Two-bulb starter kits that come packed with the Philips Hue Bridge will retail for $80 (down from $100), while individual bulbs will sell for $20 each (down from $30).

The Philips Hue Go is expected to sell on Amazon and at Best Buy and the Apple Store by early June. European shoppers can find it even sooner, with units selling this month for €100 each. Australian availability isn't locked down just yet, though Philips already sells other Hue products in the region."
This DIY kit seeks to safeguard your Abode|"

You can organize most of today's home security offerings into two groups -- do-it-yourself kits like  Scout  and  Viper Home  and contract-based professional services like  ADT Pulse and  AT&T's Digital Life.

There are a handful of hybrid systems, though ( SimpliSafe  and  Oplink , for instance), that merge easy install DIY-ness with advanced security features such as professional monitoring. But, many either lack open protocols for third-party integration or their ""optional"" monthly fees are required for viewing saved video clips and enjoying other security and automation basics.

Abode is a new hybrid system -- introduced today via Kickstarter by a former ADT employee -- that's trying to enhance this growing home security category with a suite of products, promised partnerships with  IFTTT as well as smart  thermostat ,  LED  and  lock  manufacturers and highly flexible professional monitoring fees.

The Abode kit includes a gateway, or hub, complete with RF, Z-Wave and ZigBee platforms, a 95-decibel speaker, battery backup and 3G backup. According to the Abode team, the hub was designed with future software upgrades in mind so it should be fairly easy to access any add-on features.

It also comes with two cameras.  The wide-angle ""motion"" camera is supposed to use infrared tech to take a bunch of RGB photos whenever it detects activity; it relies on three AA batteries and is expected to last for as long as five years.

The ""streaming"" camera, on the other hand, is designed to capture video clips of security events that you can save on Abode's cloud server (there's no local storage option) and review on-demand on the Android or iOS mobile apps or on the Web app.

You'll also get two lithium-ion-powered door/window sensors for targeted motion detection in particularly vulnerable spots throughout your home. These sensors operate on an RF frequency, and Abode claims that each battery will last for more than a decade. If true, that's pretty impressive.

And, while you're supposed to be able to arm and disarm the Abode system based on the location of your phone, you should be able to use the included key fob for manual arming/disarming.

Abode co-founder and CEO Chris Carneyis an ADT alum who wanted to develop a strong security system that didn't lock folks into a contract. The result, according to the team, is a more customizable system that lets you opt in to professional monitoring for the 2 to 3 weeks that you're on a trip and opt-out again when you return home (month-long monitoring will set you back $30; it's unclear if Abode prorates for shorter durations).

The team has raised just over $5,000 so far and has a ways to go to before reaching its $100,000 campaign goal. But backers still have 44 days to snag their own Abode system with a minimum contribution of $199 (the post-Kickstarter retail price is $399). This kit is only available in the US, and units are slated to ship starting in August."
BlueGuard combines a lock and a cam to patrol your door|"

A smart lock, a smart doorbell and a smart camera rolled into one, BlueGuard wants to take care of everything you could need to keep your front door safe with a single device. From electronics maker Lark-Wi, BlueGuard combines the functionality of popular smart devices like the  August Smart Lock  and the  SkyBell Video Doorbell .

The Bluetooth-enabled deadbolt can talk with your phone and unlock when you get close. It also features a motion sensor and a camera with a two-way microphone, so you can see who's at the door and chat with them remotely.

Lark-Wi is currently raising money to finish the design and bring it to mass market via a crowdfunding campaign on IndieGogo. Given the intricacy of the product, I was surprised to see the campaign only sought $6,000. Lark-Wi's BlueGuard has already achieved that goal and has beaten it by an extra few thousand.

Backers can still take advantage of discount packages, though the cheapest have all sold out. A $119 contribution will net you a single lock, $278 gets you two plus two compatible smart LED bulbs for your porch. Both packages include international shipping. The single-lock early-bird package converts to approximately £80 and AU$154. The combo pack converts to £187 and AU$360.

BlueGuard will be appealingly customizable if the promised features work as planned. Yes, the door can unlock when you get close, but if you don't trust geofencing, or want to wait until you're right up to the door, you can have it sense your presence and open with the touch of a button.

Other family members can access this feature via BlueGuard's Bluetooth enabled fobs that attach to a keychain and can trigger the same response from the deadbolt when they get close to it. Two fobs are included in the packages above.

The front of the lock is also adorned with a keyhole and a keypad, so you have a couple of old fashioned means of entrance as well. That's probably best, since BlueGuard draws power from four double-A batteries. Should something go wrong or if the batteries die unexpectedly, being able to get inside with a key would prove a major relief. It also adds to the customization options should a family member not like the high-tech approach to working the deadbolt.

For guests, you can assign temporary digital keys for easy access, or you can always remotely lock and unlock the door yourself. BlueGuard uses Bluetooth for short range communication and to unlock when you're close, but it also connects to the cloud via Wi-Fi for remote access anywhere.

Being able to communicate with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth while also running a doorbell and a camera with alerts and a live-view mode seems like a lot for four double-A batteries to manage. Lark-Wi claims the beefier lithium ion versions of those batteries can keep your lock running at full capacity for up to year. ""Normal use"" is specified, though, and not clearly defined.

Without an option to wire BlueGuard, needing to constantly swap batteries would certainly dampen the appeal of all of the tasks it can juggle.

The number of options BlueGuard offers to unlock your door beats out August, but it'll need to prove as reliable and convenient to take the place of the latter as our favorite high-tech deadbolt. It'll just need to work as promised to be the best smart doorbell we've seen.

Again, BlueGuard is a multitasker. It's a smart lock, but it also has a doorbell embedded on its front along with a video camera and a microphone. Supposedly, you can customize notifications to receive video clips or pictures when someone comes to the door. You can also chat with them via a live video call.

The smart doorbells we've tested so far have been underwhelming. The picture on  Ring  isn't clear. Like BlueGuard, it offers battery power, but it also gives you the option to wire it. Using batteries made the problem even worse and we often had trouble recognizing familiar faces.

Ring also lags significantly. After you press the doorbell, it could take as much as a minute before your phone would notify you of the event, meaning an impatient delivery person would already be gone.  SkyBell  performed slightly better overall, and had motion detection like BlueGuard, but that motion detection proved spotty at best and the picture quality was low in resolution.

Since BlueGuard's camera will sit lower than either Ring or Skybell, as it's part of the deadbolt as opposed to a detached doorbell, I'd imagine it'll be at a disadvantage in terms of both viewing and listening angle from the get go. It needs to overcome that and prove more reliable in terms of picture quality and notifications than its predecessors to stand out.

BlueGuard's bitten off a lot, between the lock, the doorbell, the camera, and the LED that can link to the system. Running that system for a reasonable length on four double-A batteries also looks like a tall task. If it can succeed in each of these smart categories individually, and not force you to constantly swap the batteries to do so, BlueGuard stands to be a winning combination."
Pure Imagination Perfect Drink review:|"

After a long day, nothing hits the spot quite like your favorite cocktail -- unless it isn't mixed properly. Enter Pure Imagination's Perfect Drink system. With an app-enabled scale and step-by-step instructions for hundreds of different drinks, Perfect Drink promises a perfect pour each and every time. After all, what's a smart home without a smart bar?

If that's a pitch that has you thirsty, then you'll be happy to know that Perfect Drink works perfectly well, and costs a not-terribly-unreasonable $70 (converted roughly, that's £50 or AU$90, with most retailers currently selling it for even less). Just like its sibling, the more kid-friendly  Perfect Bake  system, Perfect Drink's connected scale is accurate and easy to use, and the well-designed app is packed with recipes and useful features. It's a novelty for sure, and the build is hardly perfect, but if you're looking for better-mixed cocktails or perhaps a few new favorites, Perfect Drink can certainly get you there.

Perfect Drink takes the same approach as Perfect Bake, combining a handy scale with in-app smarts to offer precision ingredient management. In Perfect Drink's case, though, the ingredients are hard liquors and mixers, not cookie dough and chocolate chips.

You also obviously aren't baking anything with Perfect Drink, so gone are the mixing bowls and connected kitchen thermometer. Instead, you get a basic cocktail shaker with the kit.

Aside from that, they're essentially the same product, with scales that are all-but-identical, save for the logo. As such, I was hopeful that I'd be able to use the Perfect Drink scale with the Perfect Bake app and vice versa, but alas, I couldn't. That's a disappointment -- using one scale with both apps would significantly up the value proposition for both products.

The scale itself looks nice enough for what it is, though the build leaves a lot to be desired. The LCD display looks like something borrowed from a cheap alarm clock, and with no backlight, it gets a little tough to read in darker settings. It feels cheap, too, with a plastic build that wobbles toward the front whenever you press a button.

The true star, design-wise, is the app, especially if you're using a tablet. It looks great, with thirst-inducing images of every drink in the database, along with an easy to navigate interface and handy setup instructions.

In-app features are strong too -- particularly the ""Cabinet"" feature, which lets you select the ingredients you've got on hand from a list that's just as detailed and well-organized as the recipe database. From there, the app can tell you what cocktails you're all set to mix up -- a handy way to try something new.

Features also shine during the drink-making process. You can adjust the number of servings you're looking to make (as many as nine) and the app will scale each ingredient up or down accordingly. It'll adjust when you over pour, too -- add too much lime juice into your gimlet, for instance, and Perfect Drink will tell you how much gin to add in order to fix the ratio.

Perfect Bake impressed us with the accuracy of its scale, and Perfect Drink is no different. Drop for drop, it was just about flawless in my tests, where I made a few cocktails using pre-measured ingredients. Follow the instructions, and you can rest assured that your drink will come out the same each and every time.

I also took Perfect Drink home over a weekend for some more anecdotal testing. If that sounds like a cheap way of saying I took it home and used it to get intoxicated, you aren't wrong, but that was largely the point -- I wanted to know if this thing was actually fun to use, and whether or not the ease of use disappeared after a few drinks.

I invited an old friend over and we clinked glasses, mixing up a couple of different cocktails from the bottles I had on hand. An Old Fashioned was up first, followed by a Lemon Drop. We wanted to try something new, so I scanned the app and selected a Maple Leaf cocktail, which consists of bourbon, lemon juice and maple syrup. Pretty damned tasty, if I do say so myself.

Despite having a taste for bourbon, I'd never heard of a Maple Leaf, and if not for Perfect Drink, I'm not sure I ever would have tried one. Clearly, there was something to be said for the app's ability to facilitate experimental inebriation -- although it helped that we had a pretty wide variety of liquors and mixers at our disposal. And though our motor skills definitely deteriorated over the course of the evening (we put the over-pour detection feature to good use), the app's ease-of-use never let us down.

We also didn't spill anything, and that's a very good thing, because Perfect Drink needs to be tethered to your phone or tablet via a rather short little cable that plugs into the headphone jack. That gives it a much faster, much more precise connection than Bluetooth would, but I think I'd take that trade-off in order to get my iPad out of the splash zone.

Use a phone instead of a tablet, and the app's database gets squished down into a format that's still accessible, but much less visually appealing. I also found myself wishing that the app would tell me what ingredient I could buy that would add the most recipes into the ""In Cabinet"" section. Still, these are pretty minor quibbles about a product that works as promised.

Moving forward, maybe we'll see features like those rolled into a Perfect Drink 2.0. One could also imagine an even easier cabinet management system that uses the scale to add ingredients by weight. For now, though, Perfect Drink does the job. I can't say that I see it as any less of a novelty after testing it out, but I can't say that I didn't have fun, either.

Part of Perfect Bake's charm was its clear kid appeal, and that obviously goes out the window with Perfect Drink. At $70, I also wish that it had a better build and perhaps Bluetooth connectivity, too. Still, I could see it playing well at a party, or serving as a handy assistant for anyone looking to learn some new cocktails, and how to get better at making them.

Keep in mind, though, that Perfect Drink really only gets fun once you've got a good number of ingredients on hand and entered into the app. At that point, you'll be able to scan through new recipes you've never heard of, then quickly whip one up and take a sip. You bring the booze, Perfect Drink brings the brains. There are certainly worse smart home bargains out there."
Staples Connect D-Link Hub review:|"

Smart-home devices have plenty of connected tricks up their collective sleeve, but thanks to a glut of walled-off wireless protocols they aren't always great at communicating with one another. That's where control devices like the Staples Connect hub come into play. Acting like a router for your gadgets, the hub uses a variety of built-in wireless radios to communicate with your stuff and ensure that everything plays well together within a singular user experience.

That's the same pitch as you'll hear from  	 Wink  and  SmartThings , with hubs that cost $50 and $100, respectively. The new and improved D-Link version of the Staples Connect Hub sits right in the middle at $80. Aside from new support for Bluetooth and ZigBee, the D-Link hub boasts a better-looking build than  the original Linksys version , as well as a design that lets you untether it from your router and stash it wherever you like.

The Staples Connect platform has seen a few key improvements since I last tested it, too. Along with sprucing up its controls a bit and adding a very helpful ""Modes"" feature, Zonoff (the Staples Connect platform provider) has announced support for new devices -- most recently,  	 high-end smart televisions and Bose speakers.

However, you still won't find support for popular gadgets from  Nest  and  Belkin WeMo  (Zonoff tells us Nest support is coming in the next version of the app, due at the end of March), and camera support is limited to  subpar options from D-Link  only. If those are limitations you can live with, Staples Connect has a lot to offer, but if you're looking to start your smart home from scratch, consider waiting to see what happens with Apple HomeKit and  SmartThings 2.0  before buying in.

The new Staples Connect Hub reinvents its build, eschewing the white, modem-esque design of the original in favor of a more modern black cylinder. It's bulkier than version 1.0, and it won't fit cleanly onto most router shelves, but you won't need to keep it plugged into your router if you don't want to -- a nice flexibility improvement over the original.

There's new hardware inside the thing, too -- namely, new radios for Bluetooth 4.0 and ZigBee. The latter is the more important one right now, as more and more  	connected lighting options seem to be coalescing around that protocol, but Bluetooth is playing a growing role in the smart home, too. Add the two of them in with the existing Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, and Lutron radios, and you're looking at a broader scale of compatibility than SmartThings (Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, and ZigBee) or Wink (the same, plus Bluetooth).

Staples can also claim greater compatibility on the software side of things, with native apps for Android and Windows 8 along with distinct iPhone and iPad apps for iOS users. There's also a full-featured Web-interface, something both Wink and SmartThings currently lack.

All of that adds up to a fairly rich ecosystem of products and features, but it isn't a perfect one. You still won't find any Belkin WeMo products integrated with Staples Connect (SmartThings supports them, and even just added  	 direct compatibility with WeMo LEDs), nor will you find support for products in the Nest family, including the  Nest Protect smoke detector  and the Nest-acquired  Dropcam Pro .

That last omission is the most notable. Staples Connect offers reasonable Nest alternatives in the thermostat and smoke detector categories, but the camera section is sorely underdeveloped, with native support for D-Link cameras only. Given  	 the growing number of well-reviewed options in the connected camera space, Staples Connect seems to sit behind the curve.

Staples Connect is one of the easier smart home systems to get started with. Just plug the hub in, connect it with your router via Ethernet, then enter your Wi-Fi password into the app. After that, you can unplug it and move it somewhere else -- as soon as you plug it back in, it'll boot right back up.

Those are the same basic steps that you'll need to follow to set up a Wink Hub, but we've had hit-and-miss results with that system. Of the two, Staples Connect seems like the smoother experience to me.

Staples Connect also seems a lot better at pairing with devices. For my tests, I took the system home to my apartment and paired it with a Philips Hue LED, an Ecolink open/closed sensor, a Pico remote control from Lutron, a D-Link camera, and a variety of ZigBee light bulbs that we had on hand. With the exception of the D-Link camera, which required me to fiddle around with a separate D-Link app first, all of them paired quickly and easily.

Once everything is paired, you can begin setting up your system as you see fit. You can monitor and control your devices directly through the app, though not through the home screen, which is cluttered with grayed-out device categories you aren't even using, a quibble of mine that carries over from my review of Staples Connect 1.0.

To really put the hub to work, you'll need to start automating things. Staples Connect calls its automations ""Activities,"" and the app does a decent job of streamlining the process of creating them. There are ""Manual Activities"" that you trigger by tapping a button in the app, and ""Automatic Activities"" that happen at specific time, or that get triggered by a specific device. Activities can automate several gadgets all at once, and you can set parameters for when they will and will not run.

You can also customize ""Modes"" to help contextualize data for the hub, and tell your Activities when they should and should not run. For instance, you could create an Activity that turns the lights and alarm on when a window gets opened, then set it to run in ""Away"" or ""Vacation"" modes, but not in ""Home"" mode.

Another nice feature of these Activities is that, in many cases, they'll continue to work even if the Internet goes down. The Staples Connect D-Link Hub keeps a local cache of your settings, so unless your activity requires it to send information to the cloud and back, it can still control devices without an Internet connection.

I tested this out with that Ecolink door sensor and a ZigBee LED. Even after unplugging my router and disabling my Wi-Fi network, I was still able to trigger automated lighting changes by opening or closing my door. That wouldn't have worked with Wink or SmartThings, both of which keep your automations stored in the cloud.

In general, everything I tested worked reliably well. The star of my tests was the Philips Hue LED, which never once lagged or failed to run as expected. This comes in spite of the fact that the hub doesn't communicate directly with the bulb. Instead, it sends commands to the Philips Hue Bridge, which you'll still need to keep plugged into your router.

What's somewhat surprising about that is that performance seemed slower with bulbs that were able to communicate directly with the hub. Specifically, I tested a Staples Connect-approved ZigBee LED from LG, and also two cheaper, more popular options: the  GE Link LED  and the  Cree Connected LED , both of which cost $15 a pop. Though you won't yet find them listed as supported devices in the Staples Connect app, you can still add them manually as generic ZigBee bulbs.

All of the bulbs paired easily with the system, and I was able to control them through the app with minimal latency. Once I started automating them, however, things slowed down. I created a few different Activities that controlled all of my bulbs at once, including input from Lutron's Pico remote and the Ecolink door sensor. In each case, the Hue LED was always quick and snappy, while the rest would often lag behind by at least a few seconds. To rule out some kind of network issue, I moved my setup back to the office and repeated the tests, but saw the same laggy performance.

I spoke with Zonoff's engineers about the issue. They've tested the GE Link LED, and confirmed that it lags a bit when running on the current version of the Staples Connect software (version 7.6). What's more, when it's automated alongside other bulbs, it can slow them down, too. They haven't tested or certified the Cree LED yet, though they say they've received feedback from users that it works quite well.

I returned to my tests, and after removing the GE and Cree LEDs, found that the LG LED's lag was reduced to less than a half second when compared to the Hue LED. I added the Cree LED back into the equation, and it worked fine, too. Finally, I added the GE Link LED -- oddly enough, the lag was still gone, with all four lights turning on more or less simultaneously when triggered with the remote. The bottom line is that your performance may vary once you start adding unsupported devices.

The Zonoff team says they're working on optimizing the Staples Connect software to eliminate the GE Link LED's lag. Once that's done, they plan on adding it as a supported device in version 7.7, the same update that's expected to bring Nest support into the picture. As for the Cree LED, Zonoff tells me it's the next bulb on their list after GE, and that they tentatively expect to add support for it within the next few software updates.

Staples Connect has a lot going for it, and while I wish it supported a greater variety of cameras, the new hub gets a lot of important things right. It's easy to get the thing set up, it's easy to pair products with it, and it's easy to automate them. You don't need to keep it plugged into your router, and if the internet goes down, your automations should still run. It's a clear upgrade from the previous hub, and at $80, it costs less than the original did when it launched.

The connected home is still taking shape, and the arrival of software-based control setups like Apple HomeKit and Thread could potentially add a new wrinkle into the smart hub business model. That said, Staples Connect has been a slow, steady player in the space, and at this point, it's well-developed enough to stick around. It isn't as flashy or SmartThings or Wink, but it's cheaper than the former and more reliable than the latter. If you're looking to buy in now, give it a close look."
Panasonic's free-roaming Nubo security cam packs a 4G punch|"

Panasonic Cameramanager, a division of Panasonic that focuses on security and cloud storage, has just announced a $249 camera called Nubo that's slated for release in the UK in November and in the US in early 2016 (UK pricing is not yet fixed, but it's expected to fall somewhere in the £159-165 range).

The Nubo seems promising based on its long list of features, but it's also a definite departure from highly rated DIY staples like the  Dropcam Pro . That's because Panasonic Cameramanager ignored the established template and decided to make something entirely different.

Nubo isn't limited to a Wi-Fi network like, well, every other security camera I've reviewed. Yes, you have the option to connect over a Wi-Fi network, but this model is also 2G/3G/4G-enabled.

For convenience, a SIM card is included with your purchase and the first three months of mobile data and cloud storage are free. From there, it's up to you to opt into the mobile and cloud service subscriptions of your choosing. Mobile data is available on a by-alarm basis and you can sign up for 250; 500; 1,000 or 2,500 alarms per month; cloud storage comes in 7, 14, 30 or 90-day increments. Specific monthly fee information is not yet available.

This camera is also rated for indoor as well as outdoor use and has an operating temperature range of -4 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 to 50 degrees Celsius). And, you can use the included power adapter or buy a third party  external USB battery for on-the-go surveillance (Panasonic Cameramanager expects to introduce its own external battery in 2016 that's supposed to last for about 2 to 3 hours if it's in constant use and about 8 hours if it's in standby mode). I do wish the external battery was part of the purchase or that it relied on something simple like AA's, but this still seems way more versatile than most of the DIY models available today.

Link-Union's pre-orderable Link-U camera  is really the only model that comes close to matching Nubo in terms of mobility and backup options in case Wi-Fi, power or both go kaput, but it isn't scheduled to ship until April. The  Netgear Arlo  is somewhat similar as well, but that's mainly because it can be used indoors and outdoors and also has a magnetic backing for quick installation and removal.

Nubo is supposed to have a 1080p video resolution when it's connected to Wi-Fi and a 720p resolution when it's using cellular data. It also has a live feed, night vision, two-way talk, motion alerts, an SD card slot for local storage, and ZigBee and Bluetooth protocols, although it's still working to secure specific third-party partnerships and an IFTTT channel.

I would have liked to see sound alerts among this list of features, but Panasonic Cameramanager's CTO, Tijmen Vos, told me that this was deliberately excluded as ambient outdoor noise wouldn't make this option very useful. That makes sense, but I'd still like the option to switch it on during indoor use.

While I haven't had the chance to check this camera out in person, the team did demo Nubo via video conference so I could get a sense of its relative size and of the app's design and functionality (Android and iOS versions will be available). Nubo is smaller than an iPhone 6, and the app was full of custom options so you can get the most out of your experience. For instance, you can adjust the video clip length from 5 to 60 seconds, set it to privacy mode and more.

Panasonic Cameramanager's $249 Nubo will be available for pre-order in April on Nubocam.com, with shipping scheduled for November in the UK (Vodafone is the first European mobile partner) and early 2016 in the US. This camera is on display here at Mobile World Congress 2015 and we're in hot pursuit of photos and video footage, so check back soon for hands-on updates."
At MWC, more multitasking smart LEDs from Sengled (hands-on)|"

BARCELONA -- Sengled was  a smart standout at January's Consumer Electronics Showcase in Las Vegas, with a variety of connected bulbs designed to do more than just light up the living room. Now, the Shanghai-based manufacturer is at it again, with a new GU10-shaped version of the Wi-Fi-repeating Boost LED joining the portfolio.

Aside from providing 350 lumens of brightness, the Boost LED is designed to extend the range of your home's wireless network, with a built-in Wi-Fi repeater that promises to eliminate Internet black zones. Just pop the bulb in and pair it with your network using the Sengled app on your Android or iOS device, and it'll begin working its Wi-Fi magic, even when the bulb is switched off.

In addition to the new GU10 version, Sengled plans to release A60, PAR38 and BR30 versions of the Boost LED, with light outputs ranging from 470 to 1,000 lumens. There's also a new version of the Sengled Boost with a bulb that's clear, not coated. Boost costs £40 in the UK an AU$129 in Australia (around $65).

Also on display in Barcelona were the rest of Sengled's offerings, including the security-minded Sengled Snap, which features a built-in camera and microphone. Like the Boost LEDs, the Snap's still ""coming soon"" -- if you're looking to buy in now, you can purchase the Sengled Pulse or Pulse Solo LEDs, which have built-in speakers capable of streaming your music in stereo. A two-bulb master and satellite Pulse kit comes in at $170, AU$349 or £149, with additional satellite bulbs costing $80, AU$169 or £64 each. The Pulse Solo costs a little less, at $60, AU$129 or £48 per bulb.

Setting the extra functionality aside, Sengled LEDs are dimmable through the Sengled app, but, like most smart bulbs, not compatible with in-wall dimmer switches. No major third-party partners or integrations have been announced, though nothing's been ruled out, either.

The new GU10-shaped Boost LED draws a max of 9 watts to shine its light and boost your Wi-Fi, and glows at a soft white color temperature of 2,700K, same as the rest of the Sengled lineup. Availability is yet to be specified, but we'll be keeping our eye out as the year progresses.

Anova Precision Cooker review:|"

Sous vide might be this generation's slow-cooking, and Anova wants to be Crock-Pot. To that end, the brand's latest immersion circulator promises an even better design than  the original , new features like Bluetooth connectivity, and a lower price point, too -- just $179, or $229 for a 220V version that'll work outside of the US (converted roughly, that's about £150, or AU$295).

That last bit about the lower price is really the key factor here, as the sous vide space is starting to get crowded. Aside from rival startups like  Nomiku , water baths like  Caso  and  SousVide Supreme , and likable novelties from brands like  Dorkfood , big players like GE are getting in the game, too, with  sous vide attachments for high-end stovetops  and even  an induction-powered sous vide cooker called the Paragon . The sous vide secret is clearly out, and Anova is smart to position itself as one of the most affordable options of the bunch.

It's also still one of the best sous vide purchases you can make. The build improvements over the original are incremental at best, and I'm not convinced that the Bluetooth smarts are all that compelling, but at the end of the day, Anova didn't do anything to mess up what was already a very good immersion circulator -- and buying in now is as cheap as it's ever been. If you're looking specifically for a smart cooker, hold out for one with Wi-Fi (both  Anova  and  Nomiku  have them coming), but if you're just looking to bring sous vide into your kitchen, the Anova Precision Cooker is your best starting point.

If you aren't familiar with sous vide, it's a cooking method that suspends vacuum sealed ingredients into a water bath that's held to a precise temperature. The food gradually gets brought up to the exact desired temperature, with no risk of overcooking.

Sous vide has long been used by professional chefs and high-end restaurants, and full-size water bath units typically cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars, at very least. That's why foodies have been geeking out so hard over products like the Anova, which finally bring sous vide cooking within reach.

Like the original Anova One, the Anova Precision Cooker clamps onto the side of your stock pot, suspending its stainless-steel bottom half (and the heating coil, circulator fan, and laboratory-grade thermometer housed within) down into the water. The heating coil heats the water to your desired temperature, then cycles on and off using the thermometer's input to hold steady at that temperature. Meanwhile, the fan circulates the water to held keep everything even.

On the first-generation Anova, you'd input the temperature on a color touchscreen. There's no such touchscreen on the Anova Precision Cooker -- instead, you'll set the temperature by scrolling a rubber wheel. Unlike the original Anova, which you could set to a tenth of a degree in Celsius mode, but only whole degrees in Fahrenheit mode, the new Anova splits the difference and dials up and down in half-degree increments in both modes.

Another subtle improvement is the way the thing clamps onto your pot. Like before, you'll turn a screw to get things nice and tight, but with the new Anova, there's a second screw, too. Loosen it, and you'll be able to rotate the device, or slide it up and down through the clamp. That gives you greater flexibility with regard to the kinds of pots you'll be able to use it with.

Aside from those changes, this is largely the same device as before. Like the Anova One, it looks clean and modern. Cooking with it didn't feel much different than cooking with the original, and the food came out just as well-cooked, too. The important thing is that Anova was able to add slight build improvements while also bringing production costs down. As the brand's new baseline cooker, it's pretty tough to find much fault with it.

Of course, immersion circulation isn't the only way to cook sous vide on the (relative) cheap. All-in-one water bath units from names like  Caso ,  SousVide Supreme , and SousVant might cost a little more, but they don't require a separate pot. The  Paragon Induction Cooktop  from GE's Firstbuild initiative is really just a single-induction burner with a wireless sous vide thermometer. It doesn't stick a heating coil or a circulation fan down into the water, instead relying on the even induction heat to keep things consistent.

An advantage with that approach is that you can cook using things other than water. Fill your pot with oil, for instance, and you can use that thermometer for automated precision deep frying. You can't do that with the Precision Cooker, or with any other immersion circulator.

First things first: you can make some truly great-tasting food using the Anova Precision Cooker. Poached eggs, salmon, flank steak -- everything I made in our test kitchen came out just the way I wanted it. Of course, the same can be said of the original Anova, or of Nomiku, or of the SousVant, or any sous vide cooker worth its salt, really. In fact, we've yet to test a sous vide cooker that was unable to hold a steady temperature, or cook a really tasty steak.

With solid performance across nearly the entire category, things like usability become significantly more important for differentiating between specific products. In the case of the Anova Precision Cooker, the basic usability is quite good -- just clamp it onto your pot with the new and improved clamp, dial in to your desired temperature with the new scroll wheel, and start cooking. Like the last Anova, the wide range between minimum and maximum water levels means that you won't have to worry as much about evaporation during long cooks as you will with a device like Nomiku, which has a much tighter range.

But that's only half of the story. The other half sits with the app, which is the new, marquee feature with this second-gen cooker. In general, the app is simple and straightforward, with dials for timer and temperature control and a whole host of handy recipes. In practice, however, it's a lot clunkier than it would appear.

First off, the recipes are a nice touch, but they're too specific. What I found myself really wanting was an ingredient database. I didn't want to know how to make Sous Vide Salmon Cubes in Green Curry Noodle Soup -- I just wanted to know how to make salmon. Better still, I wanted the app to know how to make salmon, and just ask me how much I was cooking and how well-done I wanted it.

Even if you do find yourself drooling over a specific recipe, there's no way to save it as a favorite, and no way to rate it or leave a review after you've tried it. You can't enter your own recipes, either. In sum, it falls well short of the multitude of online recipe aggregators that tailor search results to the specific ingredients in your pantry, or that let you share recipes and experiences with friends. I can't imagine why I'd ever use Anova's app over sites and apps like those.

I didn't enjoy using the app to control the device, either. Find a recipe you like, and you can press Start to send the time and temperature settings to the cooker. That's cool -- except for the fact that the timer won't wait for the water to hit the target temperature before starting the countdown, which throws everything off. Manual controls are clunky, too -- you can select whatever you want in the app, but you'll need to pause the cooker and then resume heating before everything will sync up.

If I owned the Anova Precision Cooker, I think I'd ignore those smart features altogether and use the thing just like the original, dumb Anova. That might sound like an all-out failure on the part of those smart features -- and maybe it is -- but it's one that's largely beside the point. Thankfully, you don't need to use those smart features to use the Anova Precision Cooker. You don't even need to download the app. Ignore it all, and this Anova is just as good as the original -- slightly better, even.

The Anova Precision Cooker fails to offer compelling smarts for the kitchen, but it succeeds where it really counts. Like the Anova One that came before, it offers legitimate sous vide cooking chops that are both affordable and easy-to-use. It's also got a refined build and a lower price point than the last generation. As the new baseline Anova, it's hard to find much fault with it.

If you've already got a first-gen Anova (or any sous vide cooker, for that matter), you almost certainly don't need to upgrade, and if it's smarts that you're craving, you're better off holding out for a cooker with Wi-Fi. But if you're looking for a device to dive into sous vide with, you'll have a hard time doing much better than this."
Sesame kickstarts some new competition for August|"

It's no surprise that we're seeing new connected locks emerge in 2015. The recent boom in smart security options has opened the door for a new generation of smart locks, and with early contenders like Lockitron and Goji  stumbling out of the gate, many consumers are still waiting for more options.

That's where Sesame hopes to come in. The product of a Stanford University startup called Candy House Inc., Sesame promises to fit over your existing deadbolt, then connect with your smartphone over Bluetooth, allowing you to open the lock using an Android or iOS app. If you'd rather leave your phone in your pocket, Sesame says you can unlock your door using a customized knock. And, of course, keys are still an option.

With the exception of that knocking trick, that pitch sounds an awful lot like the August Smart Lock -- but the two part ways when it comes to pricing. While August retails for about $250 (roughly £160, AU$315, with international availability pending), Sesame plans to sell for $149 (£95, AU$190 -- international shipping is available, though the Sesame team notes that the lock is optimized to fit over deadbolts in the US, Canada, and Australia). Those willing to dive in now can grab an early-bird special on Kickstarter, with a limited amount bringing the price down below $100.

One problem with Bluetooth smart locks is that you need to be in fairly close range in order to use them. August answered that criticism by releasing the $50  August Connect  accessory, which relays the lock's Bluetooth signal over Wi-Fi. Sesame follows suit, with its own plug-in Wi-Fi Access Point that tacks an extra $50 onto the retail price.

With that Wi-Fi extender plugged in somewhere in your home, you'll be able to lock and unlock the door remotely no matter where you are. You'll also be able to share access with guests via the app -- no word from Candy House yet on whether or not they plan on charging for guest access in the way the  Kwikset Kevo  does. I'm also curious to see whether or not you can offer guest access with schedule restrictions.

Design-wise, the Sesame is a little smaller than August, and about half the size of the original Lockitron design (a newer, smaller "" Lockitron Bolt"" design is currently in the works too). Candy House plans to sell Sesame in four colors: black, silver, white, and -- oddly enough -- pink. There's also a woodgrain version available, though it appears to cost extra.

Candy House claims that the Sesame is protected from cyber attacks with AES 256-bit and TLS 1.2 ""military grade encryption."" They've also pledged to keep the app's code and the firmware for both the lock and the Wi-Fi extender open source, which smart-home tinkerers should be happy to hear.

The Sesame Smart Lock is scheduled to start shipping out to backers this May, which seems like a rather ambitious timetable given the difficulties we've seen other crowdfunded locks face. I'm also curious to test Sesame's ""Knock to Unlock"" feature for myself, just as soon as we get our hands on one.

Still, healthy skepticism aside, the price is a pretty clear step in the right direction. If Candy House can deliver on its promises, Sesame could be poised for smart home success. We'll keep you posted."
Accent your yard with the Mipow Playbulb Garden|"

Mipow takes a whimsical approach when it comes to lighting. Its existing lineup includes color-changing LEDs, bulbs with built-in speakers and  smart  . Now, the team is back with solar-powered lights designed to give your outdoor endeavors a little extra ambience.

This latest addition, appropriately dubbed Playbulb Garden, was recently launched on Kickstarter. The campaign has 31 days to go, but Mipow's new product has already exceeded its $100,000 funding goal; at the current exchange rate that coverts to roughly £65,000 in the UK and AU$125,000 in Australia.

As with Mipow's other LED devices, the Playbulb Garden is Bluetooth-enabled and works with the Playbulb X Android and iOS app. Playbulb X acts as a direct extension of the product, allowing you to make color and effects adjustments straight from your phone; you can control up to five Playbulb Garden lights with the same settings.

Instead of the typically-requisite batteries or power cord, these lights are equipped with solar panels that charge in sunlight, store energy in a lithium-ion battery and supposedly last for as much as 20 hours before needing another dose of vitamin D. These water-resistant LEDs also have built-in sensors that gauge ambient light and power the lights on and off automatically.

Mipow says that its Playbulb Garden lights are simple to install. Each one comes with two monopods. Attach one or both to the bottom of the product, depending on the particular height you'd like to achieve, download the app and follow the instructions for Bluetooth pairing.

Prices start at $19 for one light and go up to $209 for 10 lights (converted that's £12, AU$24 up to £135, AU$265). Shipping is free within the US and international rates range from $5 to $28 depending on the size of your order (£3, AU$6 to £18,AU$35). The first Playbulb Garden batch is slated to ship to backers in May."
Philips' new LED warms up as you dim it down|"

LED prices have fallen dramatically over the past few years, but we're seeing a $10 sweet spot emerging in the 60W replacement category. The latest is the newly announced Philips LED with ""Warm Glow"" dimming capabilities. Dial the brightness down using a dimmer switch, and you'll see a sunset-like drop in the color temperature, too, from a yellowy 2,700K down to a tone that's more reddish-orange.

That's a feature that you won't get from  Osram  and  Cree , both of which also offer 60W replacement LEDs at that $10 mark. The Warm Glow LED seems to have its sights set specifically on the Cree 60W Replacement LED, matching that bulb's 10-year warranty with its own decade of coverage.

Spec for spec, the three bulbs seem to sit pretty close together, all of them claiming a light output of 800 lumens. From our initial tests, the Warm Glow LED comes in comfortably above that number, our spectrometer measuring it at 834 lumens. That puts it in line with Osram, and makes it noticeably brighter than Cree, which falls short of that 800-lumen benchmark.

Like the Cree LED, the Philips Warm Glow LED claims a power draw of 9.5 watts, though it can claim to be the more efficient of the two thanks to that bump in brightness. However, both fall short of Osram, which only uses 8.5 watts but still manages to top 850 lumens -- good for an outstanding 100 lumens per watt.

As for color temperature, all three bulbs come in right under 2,700K. Dim the Philips Warm Glow down to minimum (about 3 percent of its maximum brightness), and the color temperature falls to 1,906K. It's a noticeable shift towards the red end of the spectrum, but not a terribly vivid one, since it only comes when the brightness goes.

The Warm Glow LED isn't Philips' first crack at selling a 60W replacement for $10 or less -- the flat-formed  Philips SlimStyle  retails for $9. That bulb came as an answer to Cree's debut LED, and in turn, Cree responded with the $8  4Flow LED . The new Warm Glow will soon sit beside all of them on the shelf at Home Depot -- we'll have a full review up once we've had a little more time to test it out."
The Daisy Plant Sensor makes connected gardening affordable|"

Plants didn't used to talk this much. Now,  more and more devices can give them a voice. For amateur gardeners or busy plant owners that need an occasional reminder, that's a good thing. The Daisy Plant Sensor, from gardening startup Digital Spring, will bring a compact, affordable option to the table when it releases this summer.

From the dirt near your plant, Daisy will send you information on moisture, sunlight, and temperature. It'll let you know what you need to do to keep your plant looking perky, showing you the data via its free iOS or Android app, and sending push notifications when it's time to take action.

Daisy's Kickstarter campaign is already fully funded, but you still have a few days if you want to contribute and preorder now. Most packages include free shipping to anywhere in the US, and for an additional cost, it will ship anywhere in the world.

Whether you get preorder discounts or not, Daisy looks quite affordable. The expected retail cost is only $16. For the UK and Australia, the price converts to approximately £11 and AU$20. If Digital Spring can make it through manufacturing and keep the cost steady, it'll be at a distinct advantage in terms of value over the other plant sensors I've tested.  Koubachi's  model costs $100 for an indoor version or $130 for a weatherproofed sensor. The  Parrot Flower Power  costs $60, and the promising  Edyn  sensor due out this spring will sell for $100.

Since Daisy is so much less -- under a third of the price of the cheapest model above -- I wonder if Digital Spring has cut corners somewhere. But the promised capabilities make the product look sound.

Daisy does make a few sacrifices to manage cost. It doesn't measure fertilizer, like Parrot, but it's database can help you plan a schedule for it. And it can only connect to its app via Bluetooth Low Energy. The Wi-Fi capabilities of Koubachi and Edyn let you check on your plant remotely, but that's also a big part of the reason for their price jump over Parrot.

With Daisy, you'll need to be within a stated 30 to 50 feet of the plant to get any new info, but proper scheduling software should help you keep track of when to water even when you're not close. And Daisy looks to have a decent amount of memory packed into its plastic casing, as it can hold data for up to 45 days at a time before offloading it to your app.

It also tracks a limited amount of garden space. Its competitors can monitor entire landscape areas, so you can use one to watch over a whole flower bed. Daisy needs a one to one ratio of plant to sensor, and looks more aimed at potted plants than gardens.

The promised 3-year battery life is more impressive than the range, but unlike Parrot when the batteries run out, you'll need to send the device back to Digital Spring to replace it. Parrot's normal AA batteries are an easy swap.

Finally, Daisy's plant database isn't nearly as robust as Parrot's yet. Digital Spring backers can request specific species to be added and help contribute info, and Daisy might gain momentum quickly with a crowd sourced approach to building the database, but the goal for the initial shipment is 200 plants. That's well short of the 6,000 Parrot carries, and having the app recognize your specific plant is important for tailored advice.

That said, again, it's $16, and 200 plants will be enough to cover common species. Every other smart plant sensor costs enough that you need to be ready to invest in your garden to make the purchase worthwhile. If you want to keep a specific potted plant alive, and you know you'll have trouble doing that for one reason or another, spending $16 on Daisy seems more than reasonable.

Koubachi and Parrot both struggled with precision and ease of use. Daisy made sacrifices to get the cost down, but if it can nail those two key factors, this cheap little gadget will be a steal."
Osram Lightify Starter Kit review:|"

EDITOR'S NOTE, 7/26/16, 12:05 PM EST: Updated to include information about potential security vulnerabilities with products in Osram's Lightify lineup, along with comment from Osram.

Osram's LEDs impressed me with strong performance in the  40  and  60W replacement  categories. This year, the brand is adding smart bulbs to its lighting lineup. Dubbed ""Lightify,"" the new product line offers a variety of different LEDs with Zigbee radios built right in. Buy the $60 starter kit, and you'll get the plug-in Gateway along with a ""color tunable"" smart bulb capable of dialing into the specific warm-to-cool color temperature of your choosing (pricing and availability of that starter kit outside of the US is not yet finalized, but the price converts roughly to about £40, or a little over AU$75).

At about $30 for an individual bulb (about £20, AU$40), the tunable Lightify LEDs cost more than twice as much as the  GE Link LED  or the  Cree Connected LED , but those bulbs don't have control apps of their own like Osram does, and they aren't color tunable, either. Also not color tunable:  Philips Hue Lux LEDs  and  Belkin WeMo LEDs , both of which cost more to get started with than Lightify. What's more, Lightify LEDs are directly compatible with WeMo, opening the door for additional automation controls.

All of that positions Osram in a bit of a smart-lighting sweet spot, making the Lightify kit an attractive starting point for anyone looking to automate their home lighting.

First things first: smart LEDs need to be decent light bulbs. It's nice having your lights turn on automatically in the morning, but much less so if the light quality isn't great.

Osram has a pretty good track record here in our test lab, so I was optimistic about the Lightify LEDs. For the most part, they didn't disappoint. Testing the bulbs out in our integrating sphere, we clocked the brightness at about 850 lumens -- comfortably north of the stated 805 lumens, and plenty bright for a 60W replacement.

That's an especially impressive number given that each bulb only draws 9.5 watts. Do the math, and you'll find that each Lightify LED is putting out almost 90 lumens per watt -- good enough to edge out our previous efficiency winner in the smart LED category, the Belkin WeMo LED. It's also quite a bit better than the Philips Hue Lux LED, which puts out less than 750 lumens from a 9-watt power draw.

Turning to color temperature, the Lightify LED comes in at a nice, accurate 2,680K when set to a target of 2,700K. That accuracy diminishes a bit at the upper end of the scale, though. Cranking to a max temperature of 6,500K gave us light that actually came in at 5,273K. That's still plenty hot, with that bluish-white ""daylight"" quality you're probably looking for, but still, it's off the mark.

As for color rendering, the Lightify LED registers a pretty pedestrian score of 78 when set to 2,700K. Dial the color temperature up, however, and the CRI inches up, too, jumping as high as 83 at that 6,500K setting. That makes sense -- yellow tones are often what end up compromising the color rendering score in LEDs, and they drop away when you raise the color temperature.

You can dim the Lightify LEDs on your smartphone or tablet, though using them with actual dimmer switches is ill-advised, since the two separate dimming mechanisms can clash, causing the bulb to flicker and strobe. The same can be said of pretty much any smart bulb, though.

In Osram's case, the Lightify LEDs will dim down to 5.4 percent brightness at minimum settings. That's a decent result, though it isn't as good as Philips Hue Lux bulbs, which will dim smoothly down to a very impressive 0.8 percent of their maximum brightness. Belkin WeMo LEDs will also dim down a bit lower than Osram, as will  Connected by TCP LEDs .

One other small performance complaint: the Lightify LEDs don't turn on instantly. Flick the switch, and you might notice about a half second pause before the light actually shines. It's a small quibble, but it might be enough of one to annoy lighting sticklers.

I spent a few days testing the Lightify kit out in my apartment, and came away satisfied with how it works. Getting things up and running only took me a few minutes, and I appreciated that Osram's app provided clear, step-by-step instructions as I paired everything up.

You'll start by scanning a QR code on the back of the Gateway to let the app know what it's looking for. Then after plugging the thing in, it'll begin broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal. Join the Lightify network using the model-specific password Osram provides, then select your home network to sync things up.

With the Gateway up and running, it's a breeze to add new lights to the system. That was a relief, as other systems -- most notably  Wink  -- have proven to be a bit finicky when pairing certain devices. With Osram, everything paired on the first try, even after deleting and re-pairing a few times.

The Lightify app offers remote management of each LED you incorporate into your system, with rotary dial-style controls for both brightness and color temperature. Add an RGB, color-changing light to your system, like the $70 Flex Strip accessory, and you'll also find a color selector similar to the one Philips Hue uses.

In addition to remote controls, you'll also be able to program automated lighting changes. For basic on/off scheduling, it's an easy process -- just set the on time, the off time, and which bulb or group of bulbs you want to automate. If you want to schedule specific changes in brightness, color, or color temperature, you'll have to save the desired state of the lights as a ""Scene,"" and then schedule a time for that Scene to activate.

It's worth knowing that security researchers have reported a number of vulnerabilities with the way Lightify products communicate with each other, including a flaw that could potentially allow a hacker to inject JavaScript and web-based HTML code into Osram's web interface. That could potentially lead to browser-based attacks on your network, including the theft of your wireless password and other sensitive data.

I asked Osram about the situation, and received the following comment from Jacqueline Boas, Osram America's head of communications and brand: ""Osram agreed to security testing on existing Lightify products by Security researchers from Rapid7. Since being notified about the vulnerabilities identified by Rapid7, Osram has taken actions to analyze, validate and implement a risk-based remediation strategy, and the majority of vulnerabilities will be patched in the next version update, currently planned for release in August.

""Rapid7 security researchers also highlighted certain vulnerabilities within the ZigBee protocol, which are unfortunately not in Osram's area of influence. Osram is in ongoing coordination with the ZigBee Alliance in relation to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities.""

I've reached out to the ZigBee Alliance for an update on these efforts, and will update this review if and when I receive one.

I also tested the Lightify bulbs out using WeMo, and found that they synced up with the WeMo Link as promised. Color-tunability controls haven't been incorporated into WeMo's app just yet, but I imagine they'll get there soon, although we're also still waiting for a long-promised WeMo LED IFTTT channel. If Belkin finally delivers on those IFTTT lighting controls, it stands to reason that they'd extend to any bulb run through the WeMo Link -- including Lightify LEDs.

Another back door to IFTTT compatibility might be the Philips Hue Bridge, which already supports third-party Zigbee bulbs from GE and Cree, and extends the power of its dedicated IFTTT channel to those bulbs, too. A tweet from Hue's team suggests that Osram bulbs have been tested for compatibility with the Hue Bridge, but I was unable to get any of the Lightify products to pair when I tried it out. It's also worth noting that the Hue Bridge isn't sold on its own -- to get one, you'll have to find one secondhand, or purchase an entire Hue or Hue Lux starter kit.

Last year, I felt that Philips missed an opportunity by not making the  Hue Lux LEDs  color tunable. Now, Osram's beaten them to the punch, with tunable Lightify LEDs set to sell for roughly the same price. Philips is still ahead in terms of platform development and third-party support (the importance of which really can't be overstated), and cheaper smart bulbs from  Cree  and  GE  lead the way in terms of affordability. The Lightify LEDs are still a strong enough alternative to merit a look -- though I'd wait to see how Osram addresses the recent security concerns before buying in."
DoorBird takes on other Wi-Fi-enabled smart buzzers|"

Bird Home Automation's $349 DoorBird Video Doorbell, preorderable now for $299 and due to ship in March, is a new  Ring  and  SkyBell  competitor. Bird Home Automation is based in Berlin and its smart doorbell will be available internationally; at the current exchange rate, DoorBird will cost roughly £225 in the UK and AU$445 in Australia.

Like other video doorbells, DoorBird is designed to act as a digital peephole so you can see who's at your front door on a Wi-Fi- or cellular-connected Android or iOS device. Whether someone physically rings the buzzer or simply walks within range of the built-in motion sensor, DoorBird is supposed to send out a push notification, alerting you to their presence.

From there, you have the option to answer the call, pull up a live video feed and chat with your guest via the two-way talk function or ignore it. Either way, DoorBird promises to take a photo of the action and maintain a log of the 20 most recent visitors. Cloud video storage will be available after the initial product launch and Bird Home Automation alludes to future HomeKit and third-party product integrations, although it hasn't announced specifics just yet.

The outdoor-rated smart doorbell has an operating temperature range of -4 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (that's -20 to 50 degrees Celsius) and a night vision mode to capture activity when it's dark. Bird Home Automation says that the installation process is simple and its BirdGuard Add-on Cameras are available as optional accessories for an additional $199 each (converted, about £130 and AU$255).

DoorBird won't hit retail until spring, but we've already requested a review unit to compare against Ring and SkyBell."
Help your whole house hit the perfect temp with Linq's Smart Vent|"

Smart vents are on the rise. After the  smart thermostat added connectivity to temperature control, two companies announced products that could make the process more precise. The idea behind  Ecovent  and the  Keen Home Smart Vent  is to focus airflow and decentralize temperature sensors so you can heat and cool specific rooms to a desired degree. Now, electronics startup Linq Home is developing a third contender -- the Linq Home Smart Vent.

Currently in development, the Linq Home Smart Vent launched a Kickstarter Campaign to fund production. Like Ecovent and Keen Home, Linq's vent will be app-enabled and swap out for your existing vents, letting you control them remotely, and adding zoned temperature control to your home for much less than a full zoned HVAC system.

By directing airflow away from rooms you're not using, Linq claims up to 25 percent savings on your energy bill, which will help recoup the hefty initial price you'd need to pay to make Linq effective. To get the best results, Linq recommends replacing every vent in your home, allowing them to communicate with each other. Each vent will cost $60, and you'll need to purchase a $200 Linq Hub to connect the system. You can preorder right now, with a thermostat and 12 vents costing $920 (around £600 or AU$1,180) with free domestic shipping for Kickstarter backers.

Linq's cost is less than the $200-per-room price estimate of Ecovent, but Ecovent includes separate temperature sensors not attached to the vent itself, claiming the readings near the airflow would be distorted. Both Linq Home and Keen Home put sensors right on the vent, and I look forward to seeing which approach works better in practice. Ecovent's logic makes sense, but adds the tedium of an extra sensor with the extra associated cost.

Each Keen Home Smart Vent costs $80, and you'll need a hub to connect those as well, but any hub with a Zigbee antenna will work. Keen Home comes out to the lowest total of the three since it only recommends replacing a third of your vents. Whether that more targeted approach or the whole-home overhaul works better remains to be seen. None of the trio of vents has been released.

Determining a winner among the three might come down to which will gain interoperability with popular smart thermostats -- like  Nest  -- first. The limbs of the HVAC system can only do so much without being able to talk to the brain. Linq recommends a smart thermostat to gain the most benefits from the system, and claims to integrate with any that have an open API.

A Linq representative mentioned Nest specifically, but it's unclear whether Linq will be able to access the full depth of Nest's features on its own, or whether it will join the  Works with Nest program for collaborative integration. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing how Linq can distinguish itself in a suddenly crowded field. No release date has been announced."
Withings Home review:|"

At $200 -- £170 in the UK -- the Withings Home is priced to compete with the  Dropcam Pro , the  Samsung SmartCam HD Pro , the  Icontrol Piper  and other highly rated DIY cameras. (Availabilty and price in Australia is yet to be determined.)

But, there's a problem: the core features that make these competing cameras so clever are partly missing from Withings Home. Yes, it has live streaming, two-way talk, night vision, motion, sound and even air quality alerts, but it can't record and save clips -- instead you get pieced-together time-lapse photographs -- its overactive motion sensor sends alerts when no apparent activity has taken place, and there's currently no Android app or Web interface. I also question its 1080p video claims; its resolution was good, not great.

That said, the Withings Home could work well as a webcam or a baby monitor (it offers nightlight and lullaby settings); I just wouldn't recommend it as a security device.

Environmental sensors help distinguish cameras like Icontrol's Piper and  Piper NV  from other standalone options. If you're interested in information like ambient light, sound, temperature and humidity, Icontrol's cameras are excellent. But, that's only because their basic features -- live streaming, free cloud storage, alerts and more -- form a solid security camera foundation.

Strip away any of those elements and you end up with something much less recommendable, something that focuses on the bonus add-ons and neglects the basics.

That's precisely where the Withings Home runs into trouble. It's a very nice-looking camera, complete with fancy extras like a magnetic base that lets you angle the camera without a complicated hardware-heavy install, an air quality sensor that picks up on carbon-based volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and nightlight and lullaby settings, but it doesn't do particularly well when it comes to core security camera features.

Take the motion sensor. It is extremely sensitive and there's no way to customize it within the iOS app. So, while it worked well when I deliberately triggered the sensor, it also sent me dozens of ""phantom"" notifications. I first noticed this when I received an alert around 2 a.m. The office was closed at that time, so I checked the saved time-lapse photo sequence, concerned, only to find that no security event had taken place.

After that, I received dozens of similar alerts at times when the office was vacant and no apparent activity had been captured. This was pretty disconcerting, since you're supposed to be able to rely on the camera to zero in on the important stuff, like someone walking in front of the 135-degree diagonal field of view, and ignore the rest -- or at least give you the option to customize the settings so you can ignore the rest.

I also don't find the time-lapse photo diary particularly useful. Most $200 security cameras will record and save clips for a set period of time so you can review footage and reference pertinent activity as needed. Withings' Home camera saves time-lapse photos on a 30-day rolling basis. These are sufficient, but definitely not as helpful as a video recording. It's the difference between playing a photo slideshow and watching a fluid video of the same activity.

Withings' Home also doesn't have an Android app or a Web interface, although it says that these features are in the works -- as well as 2- and 14- day cloud-storage options.

Those things aside, the Withings Home handled itself pretty well. I received prompt alerts, the VOC air quality chart helped identify times when potentially harmful toxins were more present, and the day and auto-night modes had little to no lag time. The Withings site says the Home camera has ""Encoding up to 1080p30."" That's 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second, but the optics definitely weren't as sharp as the Dropcam Pro,  Netgear Arlo  and many other HD models we've reviewed. Still, it was always clear enough to make out what was happening, unlike the occasionally pixelated 720p  Ring camera doorbell .

The Withings Home camera is easy to set up, and the iOS app is fairly simple to navigate. To get started, connect the supplied power adapter to the Micro-USB port. The app will walk you through the quick installation process, with light indicators to alert you to its progress. Once you're in the app, you can access the live stream, photo album, air-quality chart and monitoring settings (this is where you can opt in and out of specific motion, sound and air quality notifications and adjust the VOC alert threshold). The night vision, feature, however, was hidden in the settings section under ""My Devices.""

As far as third-party integrations, Withings is HomeKit compatible and has its own IFTTT channel. Unfortunately, Apple hasn't made its Siri-based HomeKit software platform available yet and the IFTTT channel focuses on Withings products like the Pulse, the Body Scale and the Blood Pressure Monitor instead of its Home camera. That's a shame, since cameras like  Homeboy  and camera-related apps like  Manything  have all sorts of useful IFTTT applications.

The $200/£170 Withings Home camera has a few interesting features -- a VOC sensor with real-time air quality readouts in parts per million, a timer-based lullaby and nightlight feature and even a removable cover that can be used to create a physical ""privacy mode"" -- but these peripheral features don't mean much without the expected core functionality.

Things like an Android app, optional cloud storage and adjustable motion sensitivity are pretty standard at this price range and Withings treats them like afterthoughts. This isn't exactly a failing, but it would make it hard to use the Withings Home strictly as a security camera. Consider it for your webcam or baby monitor needs, but don't expect it to do much beyond that."
Saffron 40W Replacement LED review:|"

We've seen plenty of evolution in the lighting aisle over the past decade, and that's left some struggling to find bulbs with that old, familiar feel. Enter the Saffron 40W Replacement LED, which houses the lighting technology of today within the streamlined glass curvature of yesterday.

It's a design that's sure to please if you're a lover of the incandescent aesthetic you grew up with, and you'll be pleased to hear that Saffron keeps the look-alike act going after the bulb is switched on, as well. But compare this bulb with its less inconspicuous competitors, and you'll see that the classic design is really all it has to offer. By almost every important metric -- brightness, efficiency, color quality, dimmability, you name it -- the Saffron LED lags behind the rest. That makes it a tough sell at $12, especially given that those competitors cost a little less.

If you're looking for an LED bulb that looks as little like an LED bulb as possible, then look no further. Mixed in with a lineup of incandescents, it's nearly impossible to pick the Saffron LED back out.

It's a design that certainly has me interested. Plenty of consumers favor the simple looks of yesterday's bulbs over the clunky, heat-sink-centric newfangledness of today's LEDs. A light that offers a classic build alongside modern performance is a pretty appealing pitch.

Still, today's LED light bulbs focus on heat management for good reason. Just like with your laptop or your cell phone, LED performance tends to dip as things warm up. Without traditional heat sinks or some other thermal management system, you'd think that something would have to give.

To that end, Saffron's team seems to have dialed the brightness down, rating its LED at 400 lumens instead of the 450 lumens you'd traditionally expect from a 40W replacement. It was even dimmer than that in our test lab, coming in at just 362 lumens. Brightness might not be as important with 40W replacements, which typically work best as accent lights, but still, that number is probably lower than you'd like.

You'll get well over 100 lumens more from the  Osram 40W Replacement LED , which uses the same 6W power draw and, at $8 per bulb, costs $4 less than Saffron. That also makes Osram the more efficient bulb of the two, putting out over 80 lumens per watt compared with just 60 from Saffron.

Saffron gets similarly outperformed by 40W replacement LEDs from Cree, Philips and even the  Ikea Ledare LED , which sits on its own in a strange middle ground between the 40W and 60W replacement levels. Spec for spec, all of them offer better overall value propositions than Saffron -- though none of them are nearly as good at imitating the physical look of an incandescent.

The Saffron 40W Replacement LED isn't a bad bulb by any stretch, especially if you're upgrading from an incandescent. I was pleased with both the quality of the light and the accuracy of the color temperature (there's also a Daylight version that shines at 6,500 K). Also, though I definitely wish it were a bit brighter, I wouldn't characterize it as dim, either. As a simple accent light, it'd likely do a fine job.

I was also happy to see that the classic build gives it a clean, evenly distributed light output capable of shining in all directions. Messy, badly aimed light output has been a deal breaker with a few of the LEDs that we've tested, but with Saffron, I had no such qualms.

That said, Saffron's bulb still sits at or near the bottom of the pack in nearly every performance category. As said before, its brightness disappoints at 362 lumens -- no other 40W replacement we've tested has fallen below 450. At 60 lumens per watt, it ties the Philips and Feit 40W replacements as the least efficient LEDs we've tested. It also has the worst color rendering score -- 76 out of 100 -- of any of the bulbs in our lab.

Another big strike against Saffron is the fact that its 40W Replacement LED is nondimmable. Try and use it with a dimmer switch, and you'll see the sort of strobing shown below in our flicker GIF.

Saffron does claim that its LED will last 30,000 hours -- slightly longer than the 25,000 hour lifespan you'll see from most LEDs on the market today, and longer than any of the other 40W replacements we've looked at. That's a small sign of confidence from Saffron, but one that quickly gets undercut by the fact that the bulb only comes with a 1-year warranty. For comparison, you get 5 years from Philips and Osram, and 10 years from Cree.

All in all there's nothing about this bulb's performance that left me truly impressed. For general, household lighting that isn't on a dimmer switch, it'll do the job, but not quite as well as name-brand competitors that cost less straight off the shelf at your local hardware store.

Plenty of consumers remain hesitant to make the switch over to LEDs, and at least some of that has to do with the way the things look. To that end, I give Saffron credit for making a passable LED that looks more or less indistinguishable from the incandescents that came before it.

Still, the rest of the field isn't that weird-looking -- certainly not enough so for Saffron to justify its underperforming LED on looks alone. All the same, that's what Saffron's offering here, which makes this 40W Replacement LED something of a novelty. At $12 per bulb, I'm not buying."
Green Creative 60W Replacement Titanium LED (Series 4.0) review:|"

The market for LEDs is maturing rapidly, and that means that it's easier than ever to find light bulbs that offer high efficiency, satisfying light quality, and a reasonable price point. It's a reality that spells competition for off-brand bulbs, and unfortunately, the Titanium LED from Green Creative comes up short.

A Bay Area startup, Green Creative first impressed me with its  Cloud LED , a uniquely shaped, low-price LED floodlight that performed well in our tests. The $14 Titanium LED, the brand's more traditionally shaped 60W replacement, was also a fairly strong performer, but not as strong as similar bulbs like the  Osram 60W Replacement Ultra LED  that are available at a lower retail price point. Until that price catches up with the competition, the Titanium LED is a tough bulb to recommend.

The Titanium LED doesn't share the Cloud LED's outside-the-box approach to bulb design. With a frosted globe sitting atop a white plastic body that conceals the heat sinks, it's more or less the default build of today's common household LED.

That isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially if you just want a light bulb that'll blend in with your home decor. Still, it might be a disappointment for fans of the Cloud LED's unique design.

The Titanium LED checks most all of the boxes you'd want to see checked when replacing an incandescent. With a stated light output of 800 lumens (we measured it higher than that, at 835), you aren't getting shortchanged on brightness, and with a power draw of just 9 watts, it's efficient enough to claim more than 90 lumens per watt. It's also dimmable down to 3.8 percent of its maximum brightness, and it comes with a 3-year warranty.

All of that is very good, but compare it with that second column in the chart posted above: the  Osram 60W Replacement Ultra LED , which costs $4 less than the Titanium LED. With 852 lumens from 8.5 watts, Osram's bulb is good for 100 lumens per watt, dims smoothly down to zero percent, and comes with a 5-year warranty. About the only place the Titanium LED can claim an edge is in the color-rendering score, where it beats Osram by a nose, 80 to 78.

The  Cree 4Flow LED  is another strong competitor for Green Creative here. While it can't boast efficiency that's quite as high, Cree's plastic-bodied LED does manage to match the Titanium LED's light output, and it also dims down low without the same degree of flicker that we saw from Green Creative (or the Osram, for that matter).

More importantly, the 4Flow also costs just over half of what you'll need to spend for the Titanium LED. For an even cheaper option, you could consider the surprisingly impressive  Ikea Ledare LED , which costs just $5.

That's pretty stiff competition for Green Creative. With bulbs like those from Osram, Cree, and Ikea each selling for less than $10, I would have liked to have seen something more from the Titanium LED to justify the $14 price point. It's in a similar position as the $15  Philips 60W Replacement LED , but that bulb at least offers near-perfect dimming. A feature like that, or perhaps a color-rendering score closer to 90 might have helped the Titanium LED to set itself apart.

The Titanium LED offers a satisfyingly warm color temperature that falls just under 2,700K. As with the Cloud LED, you have a few other color temperature options as well, including an even warmer 2,400K that falls closer to the red end of the spectrum, along with a hotter, more whitish 4,000K version.

The common practice is for bulb manufacturers to charge an extra buck for these color temperature outliers, but Green Creative offers them at no extra charge, which is nice to see.

The light output is also satisfyingly omnidirectional, which means that the bulb offers plenty of downward glow in addition to the light that shines up and out. That makes it a decent choice for a bedside reading lamp, or any other setting where even light distribution is key.

In addition to verifying each bulb's light output, color temperature and color rendering scores in our integrating sphere setup, we use a variac transformer to measure and confirm its power draw. Green Creative claims that the Titanium LED draws 9 watts, and that looks to be conservative, as we measured it at just under 8.5. Factor that in with the overperforming light output, and you're looking at efficiency that's closer to 98 lumens per watt -- still less than Osram, but only barely.

We also make sure to investigate how each bulb performs on dimmer switches. The Titanium LED did an acceptable job here, dimming smoothly on new Lutron and Leviton dimmers designed specifically for LEDs, and also on an old triac rotary-style dimmer intended for incandescents only.

We were able to dim the bulb down as low as 3.8 percent of its maximum brightness, which is a decent result, but we also detected a small amount of flicker at those minimum levels. The flicker wasn't consistent across each dimmer, and was most noticeable on the Leviton model, so keep in mind that your mileage may vary depending on the specific hardware in your home.

All in all, the Green Creative Titanium LED is a perfectly decent bulb that offers strong, consistent performance across the board. As recently as last year, $14 would have been a very fair price for such a well-rounded LED option, and I likely wouldn't have had any trouble recommending it.

The lighting landscape is evolving quickly, though. By now, there are simply too many strong options available for $10 or less, including bulbs like the  Osram 60W Replacement Ultra LED , which edges Green Creative out at nearly every turn of the spec sheet. I remain impressed with the quality of Green Creative's bulbs, and I'm looking forward to an upcoming high-CRI version of the Cloud LED, but unless the Titanium LED gets a price cut, it isn't a bulb I'd recommend."
Netgear Arlo Smart Home Security review:|"

Of the DIY security cameras we've reviewed, battery-powered models are not particularly common. That's because you usually have to give up key features like live streaming and HD video quality so you aren't constantly swapping out batteries. The trade-off, of course, is a camera that's plugged into an outlet 24/7.

Interestingly, Netgear didn't do away with those power-hungry options when it made its battery-only, 720p-resolution, motion-sensing, night-vision-equipped, indoor/outdoor Arlo cameras. They retain the resolution and on-demand video feed of a typically-tethered camera and add on the free-roaming flexibility of one that's battery-powered. The result is an elegant solution to a classic security camera conundrum.

Plant these beauties in and around your home for an impressively solid system that's unmoved by shifts in the weather. Just make sure you keep CR123 lithium batteries handy, as battery life will vary a lot based on usage and proximity to the included Netgear Arlo hub. Still, I recommend Arlo to anyone in need of an adaptable indoor/outdoor camera system. The two-camera kit I reviewed here costs $350, but you can also get a single-camera kit for $200 and additional cameras for $160 each. (The Arlo is slated to be available later the first quarter of this year in the UK and onverted pricing is about £233.)

In Australia you can get the two camera kit for a rather hefty AU$588. The one camera kit is AU$349 -- individual add-on cameras are AU$249. In all, this is a pricey product in Australia.

The kit I reviewed comes with two HD cameras, eight CR123 lithium batteries (four per camera, they can run with just two batteries, though), four magnetic mounts with included hardware and a hub that connects to the router. The hub and cameras are finished in glossy white plastic. The hub seems unnecessarily large and utilitarian-looking, but otherwise fine.

The palm-sized cameras are much more discreet. Each one has a 130-degree field of view and automatically-adjusting night vision. Netgear claims that Arlo cameras have an operating range of up to 300 feet from the hub and a 4 to 6-month battery life. This is where Arlo's impressive adaptability breaks down a little bit for me.

That 300-foot range appears to be true only under optimal conditions -- with few to no obstacles interfering with the signal. Also, the distance between each camera and the hub, how often you access features like live streaming and whether or not you set the cameras to ""best video,"" ""optimized"" or ""best battery life"" mode will all influence how long the cameras last before needing new batches of CR123's.

The indoor-only  Homeboy  camera I recently reviewed has a rechargeable battery that's supposed to last for three months on a single charge. To achieve this long-battery-life feat, the team employed its own low-power Wi-Fi tech, a 640x480-pixel resolution and did away with live-steaming capabilities altogether.

However, after a week of testing the Arlo cameras mainly in ""best video"" mode, both cameras still have a full charge. Interestingly, though, when I take the fully-charged cameras outside in the below-freezing weather, the battery status indicators drop swiftly. When I return inside, the status bars go back to their previously fully-charged setting.

Arlo's operating temperature range is 14 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit (about -9 to 50 degree Celsius)  -- some complaints have surfaced online showing that a cold Arlo camera could claim to have a lower battery life than it really does. Netgear says that this is a known issue that it is working to address. We aren't exactly in the arctic tundra here in Kentucky, but the winter temperatures regularly dip below freezing and 14 degrees Fahrenheit certainly isn't an impossibility. Since that's also true for a large portion of the country, I wonder about this system's outdoor reliability by season.

Even so, I was impressed by each camera's ""true"" range (closer to 150 feet during testing), the minimal lag time in live streaming mode, the responsive mobile alerts and email notifications, the crisp 720p resolution in day and night mode and the ability to access MP4 files of the clips from the email notifications. I would like to see a speaker and a microphone integrated into its setup, though.

I tested this kit out at three locations and was always surprised by how easy it was to set up.

The initial configuration took less than ten minutes and each following attempt less than five. Just connect the hub's ethernet cable and power cord to the router and download the free Android or iOS app. You can create an account on either the mobile or Web app. Then, add the batteries, sync the cameras with the hub (this requires pressing the sync button on the hub and then on each camera) and you're ready to stick your cameras wherever the hub's range will allow.

The app's home screen displays all of your connected cameras. The free, 7-day recording option lets you sync as many as five cameras. There's also a 30-day option that costs $10 a month and lets you sync up to 10 cameras, as well as a 60-day option that costs $15 a month and lets you sync up to 15 cameras (you will need more than one hub to accommodate this many cameras, though). Each add-on camera costs $160.

Unlike some other live-streaming interfaces, this one has play and pause buttons. This sort of forced opt-in design probably helps keep the battery life in check, but it is slightly inconvenient. Still, you can watch multiple live streams at once or watch one camera on a full-screen view. Within live stream mode, you can record or take a photo on-demand as well as adjust the brightness of the shot.

The library section displays a calendar. Select a certain day to get access to saved clips. The mode and settings sections allow you to really customize your cameras. Mode section lets you set schedules for the motion sensor or simply turn them on or off at-a-glance. Access settings to manage your cloud storage, push notifications, video quality and more.

The app has pretty much everything you need, but it isn't the most intuitive design. For instance, I'm not sure why there's a separate mode and settings section -- it seems like that could all be condensed into one category.

While the Netgear Arlo doesn't currently have an IFTTT channel or integrate with any third-party devices, these small cameras can do so much on their own that they're definitely worth consideration. We haven't reviewed any other battery-powered DIY security cameras that manage to deliver HD resolution from a significant distance -- either indoors or outdoors in either day- or night-vision modes. I'm definitely skeptical about the Arlo's ability to properly handle itself in cold temperatures and how the CR123 batteries would fair after several months, but this versatile security kit is still a win."
SkyBell Video Doorbell review:|"

The $200 SkyBell smart video camera-equipped doorbell is different than BOT Home Automation's now-defunct  Doorbot  and newer  Ring  buzzer. Where Ring boasts a 720p video resolution, the option between a battery or wired installation and an activity log (but no on-demand live streaming), SkyBell has a 640x480 video image, a wired-only setup and on-demand live streaming (but no activity log).

Still, they share core features. When someone rings the doorbell, you will get a push alert that links directly to a live video feed so you can see who's there whether you're in the basement, at the grocery store, or on a remote beach (as long as your phone has a Wi-Fi or cellular connection, that is).

It's the quality of these basic functions that set SkyBell slightly above Ring. SkyBell certainly wasn't perfect -- it suffered from inconsistent audio, and you can't currently record video or save clips -- but its lower-quality VGA camera never once suffered from the same streaky bandwidth fatigue that made it tough for Ring to clearly display who was at the door. Get SkyBell for its relative reliability, but don't expect this new release to feel like a fully realized product just yet.

Installing SkyBell was a huge hassle at first. As a doorbell novice, I didn't know much about digital versus mechanical models and was not fully prepared for the intricacies of these two buzzer types. The beauty of Ring is that folks who don't have a wired setup can skip that whole discovery process and move straight to the good stuff -- actually using the device.

SkyBell does not afford you that luxury. You have to hard-wire your SkyBell, and you really need to know if your current buzzer is digital or mechanical before you buy. My house doesn't have a wired doorbell, so I took my SkyBell review unit to a house that did.

Removing the existing doorbell and replacing it with SkyBell was a little trying. SkyBell offers a couple of baseplate variations so you can angle and adjust your model as needed, but there's very little room between the base and faceplates, so the blue wire covers provided simply didn't fit. So, I switched to electrical tape and was able to shove the wires far enough back that the two pieces fit together.

The final installation step involves the world's tiniest Allen wrench and a near-microscopic screw that fits underneath the doorbell to secure everything in place. It took me several attempts to get this right.

Thankfully, configuration was pretty straightforward. Enter a long activation code (located on your SkyBell box), hold the doorbell button down until the light flashes red, and follow the Android or iOS app instructions to connect to the SkyBell network and then to your local Wi-Fi network. That part took about five minutes.

But I ran into a fairly significant problem at this point: the doorbell was chiming continuously for no apparent reason. A visit to the SkyBell site revealed that this house had a digital doorbell, that's a computerized chime instead of an actual chime. SkyBell units support digital bells, but you have to buy a separate piece of hardware called a Digital Doorbell Adapter. This is a small $12 circuit gizmo that you have to install at the source of your digital chime.

SkyBell has a tutorial video showing how to do this, but this house had an intercom rather than a single dedicated chime, and its wiring was considerably more complex than what was outlined in the tutorial. As it turns out, the Digital Doorbell Adapter won't work with any intercom setup. So, not only are non-wired doorbell homes out of luck, homes with intercoms are too -- and non-intercom digital doorbell homes will have to install both the SkyBell and the adapter. Complicated.

From there, I tracked down a house with a basic mechanical rig and tried my luck there. Once installed, I didn't experience any of the frustrating, continuous bell-ringing that happened at the digital doorbell house. I configured it and the SkyBell began to work right away.

Physically ringing the bell and enabling the motion sensor feature all resulted in swift push alerts that linked directly to the 130-degree live feed. The quality wasn't spectacular, but it was consistent throughout testing and much better overall than Ring's laggy and streaky 720p. I also spent some time trying out the on-demand live streaming feature; this worked similarly well. Press the button once, and the app will connect to a live feed.

Even though the live streaming button is a nice addition, I really wish it had an accompanying activity log with access to saved clips. Right now, you can only take a snapshot of the video feed. Since it isn't automated, you have to be at the ready to press that camera button whenever you want to capture activity.

And while you can add multiple people to a single SkyBell account, only one person can view the live feed at a time. So if two family members receive the same motion-triggered push notification, only the first person to open the feed will be able to see it. The first time this happened, I though the video feed had stopped working, but, alas, it's just limited to one person.

Unfortunately, the audio quality was pretty poor. Most of the time, it sounded like a bad phone connection, with only every few words coming through. That was very disappointing, since you're supposed to be able to see and chat with whoever's at your door. Still, it's better than Ring's hit-or-miss video feed, the most essential feature to the whole smart doorbell operation.

I noticed something interesting during testing. When we first acquired a second-gen SkyBell unit in December 2014, its motion sensor was located below the camera (pictured above, right). Interestingly, we saw some photos of a slightly different-looking SkyBell unit that wasn't version 1.0 or the 2.0 model we were testing (pictured above, left). As it turns out, SkyBell made a quick sensor update after its early 2.0's had already been released, so your 2.0 could look like either of these models. SkyBell claims that there's no ""material difference"" between the two, but we decided to focus on the newest 2.0, which has above-the-camera sensors.

SkyBell doesn't have an IFTTT channel or work with any third-party devices or hubs. The company is an Apple HomeKit partner, but this particular product doesn't allow for any Siri-related home automation integration.

SkyBell is a definite step up from its competition, once you've confirmed that it will work with your existing doorbell configuration. After that, you'll get alerts whenever someone rings the bell or triggers the motion sensor  -- and you can check in whenever you want via the on-demand video button. That's nice, but the low audio quality and lack of clip storage gives this app a bit of an unfinished feel. It might be the finest smart doorbell offering we've seen yet, but that just shows that this budding market has some work to do."
Green Creative BR30 Cloud LED review:|"

The Green Creative BR30 Cloud LED looks like something straight out of Star Trek, but the futuristic-looking build serves a purpose. Floating the LEDs up above the body of the bulb reduces the weight of the bulb, and also helps it manage heat better, which, as anybody who's ever owned a laptop that was prone to overheating can attest, is a good thing.

Sure enough, the Cloud LED manages heat exceptionally well, and also boasts ample brightness and better efficiency than any other floodlight we've tested out. Though not quite as well-rounded as the Editor's Choice-winning  GE Reveal BR30 LED , Green Creative's Cloud LED is a very solid pick for directional lighting, and at $13 each ($5 cheaper than GE), it's a great value, too.

The majority of LEDs on the market today strive to replicate the classic look of incandescents as best they can. The Cloud LED strives for something different, eschewing familiarity and taking a fresh approach to BR30 design. This isn't simply a means of standing out -- the hollowed out build means that the bulb requires less materials to produce.

It's a similar design approach to what we saw with the equally priced  Philips SlimStyle BR30 LED , where the diodes sit in a flat disk atop a skinny stub of a body. Both lights weigh considerably less than their competitors, and both promise to manage heat better, too.

Comparing the two spec for spec, you'll find that the Cloud LED comes out ahead at almost every turn. Both bulbs claim a light output of 650 lumens, but when we tested that out with our spectrometer and integrating sphere, the SlimStyle actually came in at 627 lumens, while the Cloud LED came through with a very impressive reading of 710 lumens.

We got the same result when we double checked with a second 2,700 K Cloud LED, and saw equally impressive, above-the-benchmark numbers from Cloud LEDs at other color temperatures, too. These include an extra warm 2,400 K Cloud LED, and a white light, daylight version of the Cloud LED that shines at 4,000 K.

I was also impressed with the fact that the Cloud LED puts that light out from a power draw of 8 watts. That's less than any other BR30 LED we've tested. Coupled with the bump in brightness, the Cloud LED is easily the most efficient BR30 that's ever passed through our lab, putting out nearly 90 lumens per watt. No other bulb we've tested has managed to hit even 70 lumens per watt.

If there's any disappointment to be had with the Cloud LED's specs, it sits with the color-rendering score, which fell just below 80 out of 100. The color rendering score measures how accurately a given light source is able to illuminate colors when compared to pure daylight. Most LEDs claim scores right around 80 -- a fairly unimpressive number that typically results from especially low scores with red tones, an area where LEDs tend to struggle.

Our color-rendering winner in the category is the Editors' Choice-winning  GE Reveal BR30 LED , which clocks in at a score of 89, and offers incredibly well-rounded performance by nearly every metric. While I wouldn't expect a baseline light like the Cloud LED to score quite that high, something at least a point or two above 80 would have been nice to see.

Additionally, while the 3-year warranty is perfectly fine for an LED that's priced relatively low, it's worth noting that you can get 10-year warranties with both the GE Reveal BR30 LED and the  Cree BR30 LED . Of course, you'll pay more up front for each one, too.

There's a back corner of the small appliances lab that we've designated as a light bulb testing nook. CNET technical editor and light bulb tester extraordinaire Jared Hannah (pictured above) spent a considerable amount of time in that nook with a box of Cloud LEDs, and came away quite impressed.

We were happy to see that the bulb's power consumption is just as low as Green Creative says -- lower, in fact, coming in at 7.8 watts. Running the thing for an average of three hours a day, your yearly energy cost would be less than a dollar per bulb. For comparison, the sort of 65W incandescent BR30 that the Cloud LED might be used to replace would add nearly $8 per year to your energy bill. A 65W replacement fluorescent would cost somewhere just under $2 per year.

As said before, the brightness this light puts out was impressive, too. Anything above 650 lumens is solid, and the 2,700 K version of the Cloud LED came in at over 700 lumens. The 4,000 K version was even brighter still.

Brightness is also where the bulb's heat management capabilities come into play. All LEDs will dim down ever so slightly after you first turn them on as the heat starts to build up. This is why LEDs typically have heat sinks, convection fans, or some other form of thermal management. As the bulb heats up, those thermal management systems will kick in, helping the light hit what's called the ""steady state.""

This steady state is where the brightness levels off -- a good LED will hit that steady state in less than twenty minutes, and land somewhere above 85 percent of the initial light output. Anything less than that, and the initial brightness dip starts getting noticeable. Oh, and don't worry -- the steady state is where bulbs get rated for brightness and efficiency (and where we test them, too), so you aren't getting short-changed from what's quoted on the packaging.

The Philips SlimStyle BR30 is a good example of an LED that deals well with heat -- it hits the steady state after about fifteen minutes, and plateaus above 85 percent. The Cloud LED, however, does even better. In our tests, it consistently hit its steady state after 15 minutes, and plateaued up above 90 percent. Wonky, sure, but it's a terrific result nonetheless.

A bulb with a higher, faster steady state is one that deals with heat particularly well, and in practical terms, this means that it'd likely be a good choice for enclosed fixtures, where the heat gets trapped and becomes more of an issue for the bulb. The Cloud LED is also rated for dampness, which means you can use it outdoors, providing the bulb isn't going to get rained on directly.

Green Creative also rates the Cloud LED for use with dimmer switches, and in our tests, we found that it did, indeed, work with all of the switches in our lab, dimming down to roughly 7 percent of its max brightness. That's an acceptable result for sure, but I'd prefer something that dimmed down below 5 percent, or better yet, cleanly down to zero. We also saw a noticeable amount of flicker when we used the Cloud LED on a dimmer switch, though not as much as with the SlimStyle BR30.

This bulb gets just about everything right, and at $13, it's a solid bargain. With very good scores in both brightness and efficiency, along with a variety of color temperatures to choose from, I think most people would be perfectly happy using the Cloud LED for basic household lighting, and I'd recommend it over the equally priced  Philips SlimStyle BR30 LED , too.

For a BR30 LED that works better on a dimmer switch, and also one that offers a very nice uptick in the color rendering department, the  GE Reveal BR30 LED  definitely merits strong consideration. However, for general usage and overall value, Green Creative's Cloud LED is awfully tough to beat. You an find it in select retailers, and online at sites like 1000bulbs.com and earthled.com."
The connected Hive system gives your smart home eyes, ears and a voice|"

Amid a swarm of smart home products, Hive (Not to be confused with  British Gas Hive , an app-controlled thermostat available in the UK) hopes to earn some buzz by centralizing the smart home and giving it a voice. The Hive Trio from Salt Lake City startup Hive Life includes the Hive Sound for voice commands, audible push notifications and streaming music, as well as the Hive Hub to communicate with automation accessories, and the Hive App for remote functionality.

Hive Life hopes to raise funds via their Kickstarter campaign for tooling and manufacturing. Backers can take advantage of early bird pricing -- as low as $149 for the Trio that will normally cost $279 -- and receive a unit as soon as May of this year.

The most notable part of the Hive system, the Hive Sound, is a connected speaker first and foremost. You plug it into a wall and control it with an app, and it can stream music to it from a number of compatible services including YouTube,  Pandora,  Spotify,  TuneIn  and  iHeartRadio .

Hive says you'll be able to sync up multiple Hive Sound speakers to surround yourself in the music of your selected playlist, or they can each play something different to please family members with different tastes in different parts of the house.

You'll control each Hive Sound with the third part of the Hive Trio -- the app -- via Bluetooth. The Sound includes both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capability, which allow it to go beyond just being a speaker and let it act as an integral part of your smart home.

In fact, the Hive Sound will be one of the few devices on the market that can give your smart home a voice. Hive will offer accessories such as cameras, monitors for doors and windows, and motion sensors. Like most smart-home systems, when these devices sense something, you can get alerts sent to your phone. You can also have the Hive Sound tell you something is amiss audibly.

Hive will even offer an optional live monitoring service and you'll be able to use the Hive Sound to speak to a concierge in the event of an alarm. The two-way audio will allow you to control your smart home with voice commands as well.

What you're able to command with your voice will depend largely on what else you have hooked into the system. Fortunately, the Hive Hub has the antennas necessary to connect just about any first- or third-party accessory to the Internet. You'll need it to use the camera and sensors mentioned above, but with Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth built-in, Hive's hub will be more than capable of centralizing a home with a variety of products.

The hub will plug into your router and into your wall and can then send notifications and alerts from anything linked to it via the Hive app. It remains to be seen if Hive can work with third-party apps as well as devices, or if you'll be able to control the advanced functionality, rules, and automation of third-party products with Hive's app.

Hopefully, you can give a customized command to the Hive Sound such as ""Lock Up"" and have it close the garage door with the  MyQ Garage , bolt the  August deadbolt , turn off your  Philips Hue lights , and adjust your  Nest Thermostat .

If it can manage all of this, the Hive system might be as useful as Apple's upcoming  HomeKit, which will let Siri control a variety of compatible smart home products. Though, Hive's products might not be able to respond to voice commands spoken to your phone the same way.

Still, giving your smart home a voice is a unique twist to push notifications in home automation. Hive promised plug-and-play simplicity with its system, but I'd like to see more evidence of advanced functionality before I'm convinced this is the unifying hub we need.

Hive has at least checked all of the boxes in terms of signal compatibility, and both its Hub and Sound include battery backups so your system will run in a power outage. The Hub even has a 3G modem so it can communicate with the cloud via a cellular signal if the Wi-Fi goes down.

I'd expect both 3G and live monitoring to be extra, and it's unclear if Hive's camera will let you store footage locally or if you'll need to pay for cloud recordings. No word on exact pricing on any of this yet, but Hive's website promises to eschew contracts and ""earn your business every single month.""

Both  Control4 and Savant have popular and comprehensive smart-home systems, but they require a dealer install.  SmartThings and  iSmartAlarm  offer advanced DIY options with bundled kits of sensors, but don't offer voice control or package entertainment with automation. Hive's system has the look of well-rounded interoperability.

On its own, the Hub might not make much sense until you're ready to purchase a few sensors, or unless you already have a variety of smart-home products you're looking to connect. Without it, the Hive Sound loses its depth of features that makes it intriguing. But the combination of entertainment and connectivity possible with the system makes investing in Hive an intriguing prospect. With Hive, you can talk to your smart home and it can talk back."
iSmartAlarm iCamera Keep review:|"

iSmartAlarm is a fee-free smart security system -- purchase a starter kit and place the included sensors around your home, and you'll be able to track all of them from your iOS or Android device, or receive alerts if the alarm is triggered.

I liked iSmartAlarm quite a bit  when I first reviewed the system back in 2013 , and it's since found its way onto our Best of the Smart Home list as the top monitor-it-yourself security kit. However, iSmartAlarm's most notable weak spot was its optional camera accessory, which, unlike the rest of the system, was a glitchy, unreliable headache to use.

Enter the iCamera Keep, iSmartAlarm's second stab at video monitoring. With a smaller design and claims of improved performance, it promises to shore up the system's camera capabilities. In our tests, it did exactly that, showing none of the glitches that plagued the original iCamera and working well both as a standalone device and as part of a larger iSmartAlarm setup. Plus, at $150, it's a more affordable option than the $200  Dropcam Pro , or standalone security devices from  Canary  and  Piper , which each cost closer to $250. UK and Australian prices have yet to be announced but $150 converts to £100 in the UK, or about AU$190 in Australia.

However, as solid as the iCamera Keep looks, it doesn't yet offer the ability to store video clips in the cloud or on a local drive, though that functionality is supposed to be on the way. This also means that in its current state, it won't automatically record video whenever the alarm gets set off. That's a pretty key omission here at launch, and if you wanted to wait until iSmartAlarm rolls that functionality out before buying in, I certainly wouldn't blame you.

The iCamera Keep is a boxy, slightly bland-looking rectangle, roughly the size of a can of Red Bull. It's a much, much slimmer profile than the original iCamera, so it won't hog nearly as much real estate on whatever shelf you decide to sit it.

The camera that bulges out from the body of the thing is capable of recording video at a resolution of 1,280x720 pixels -- good for a picture that's technically HD, but not one that's as crisp or as detailed as 1080p competitors or even some 720p competitors, like  Dropcam Pro .

The entire camera will also pan in a near-complete circle of 350 degrees -- just swipe left or right on the app's video feed, and the camera will rotate accordingly. You can also swipe up and down to tilt the camera over a span of 40 degrees. However, it won't automatically pan and tilt to follow the action in your living room, or to turn toward a loud noise.

There's also night-vision functionality, which is obviously a pretty important feature for these types of products. In my tests, it worked fine, kicking on and off automatically as needed and doing a solid job of making us all look exceedingly creepy. However, the image didn't seem quite as strong or as detailed in the dark as the recently reviewed  Piper NV . In that above example, I show up just fine in the foreground, but my colleague Megan Wollerton all but disappears into the background.

The iCamera Keep also features built in motion and sound sensors -- if you like, the app can send you a push notification if the camera detects either. Connect the iCamera Keep with the iSmartAlarm's CubeOne base station, and these alerts can trigger the alarm, or turn on and off automatically depending on whether or not the system is armed.

What those alerts won't do is trigger the camera to start recording, at least not yet. As of publishing this, if the system is armed and the camera picks up sound or motion, you'll get an alert, the alarm will sound and you'll be able to jump to your video feed to see what's happening live, but nothing will have been recorded. If you like, you can push the big button below the live feed to snap a picture, but you still can't record video, not even manually.

The reason for this is that iSmartAlarm's team still needs to finalize its video storage mechanisms, something they're promising to deliver with an app and firmware update in February. When it comes, they plan to offer free local storage of video clips by way of the USB port in the back of the camera, and also options for cloud storage.

Also, to the credit of iSmartAlarm's team, they were open about the fact that video storage functionality wouldn't be up and running until a few months after launch back when the iCamera Keep was first announced last year. Points for managing expectations.

Here's how iSmartAlarm tells us its video recording will work. When the system is armed and the camera detects sound or motion, it will record a 10-second clip, upload it, then check for sound and motion again. If it still detects a disturbance in the force (and if the alarm hasn't been disarmed yet), it'll record another 10-second clip, then another, and another.

Once that functionality is in place, the iCamera Keep stands to be an even better product than it already is. As soon as that new version of the app and firmware are out, I'll be sure to test it and update this review accordingly -- including the score, if merited. Watch this space.

To get started with the iCamera Keep, you'll download the iSmartAlarm app to your Android or iOS device and tell it you want to add a new camera. The app will prompt you to connect the camera to your phone via USB cable -- once you do, the camera will hop onto your phone's Wi-Fi network. The process took me less than a minute, though it failed the first time I tried it because I was using a third-party USB-to-Lightning cable. Once I used the certified Apple cable that came with my phone, it worked perfectly.

With the camera connected to Wi-Fi and registered with the app, you'll immediately be able to begin viewing your live video feed. As said before, you can swipe over the feed to pan or tilt the camera, but you can't pinch in to zoom, the way you can with Piper's fish-eye lens.

After testing live monitoring out in multiple locations and on multiple wireless networks, I came away thoroughly impressed. My video feed was always smooth, and hardly lagged at all. The only delays I encountered were with the pans and tilts -- sometimes, it'd take about a second between the swipe and the actual rotation. Also, if you swipe too frequently, the camera might lock up for a few moments to catch up.

Over a few days of testing, I did experience one or two feed freezes, but I was able to get going again each time simply by restarting the app. I never needed to restart the camera itself, and I never had a problem getting the feed going again after unplugging the camera to move it to a new spot. After a minute or so, it would always boot right back up.

You can manage the iCamera Keep's motion and sound detectors through the dedicated iCamera settings section, where you'll be able to switch alerts on or off, and also adjust the sensitivity of each sensor. With the motion sensor, I found that high and medium settings worked well, while the low sensitivity setting barely registered anything.

The sound sensor was a little better -- the low sensitivity setting required me to clap my hands or shout before triggering an alert, while the high sensitivity setting picked up the sound of me slowly ripping a piece of paper from about 10 feet away.

Of course, those frequent motion and sound alerts get old fast if you're at home, so you'll need to remember to turn them off and on when you come and go. You can improve that situation by linking the iCamera with the CubeOne, iSmartAlarm's base station. If you do, the alerts will only fire off when the system is armed, and when they do, they'll trigger the alarm.

Again, things worked great when I tested these system-wide alerts, with the CubeOne and camera linked. Whenever I'd arm the system, then try and trigger the iCamera Keep's sound or motion detectors, the CubeOne's siren would sound, and I'd receive automated text messages warning me about the breach, along with an automated phone call. iSmartAlarm doesn't currently offer an option for live monitoring -- instead, calling the police is left up to your discretion.

In sum, the iCamera Keep worked like a charm both on its own and after adding it to an existing iSmartAlarm setup. My only complaint is that integrating the iCamera Keep into an existing setup doesn't offer you much additional functionality aside from the ability to trigger the system's siren, at least not yet. We'll see if that changes moving forward.

Something else that I'd like to see improved are iSmartAlarm's proprietary Smart Switches, which were released alongside the iCamera Keep. As of now, there's no option to sync them up with any of iSmartAlarm's sensors, or with the iCamera Keep. You can only program them to turn on and off at specific times. That's fine if you want to turn a lamp on and off in your window while you're away on vacation, but it doesn't do you much good if you want the lights to come on if the camera gets triggered late at night.

Fortunately, that's something else iSmartAlarm is promising down the road: a dedicated ""Rules"" section for the Smart Switches, modeled loosely after the if-then-style automations of IFTTT. If those rules don't come with February's app update, iSmartAlarm's team says they'll definitely arrive by Q3 of this year, when they plan on releasing version 2.0 of the app, an update they're calling a pretty major overhaul of the user interface. Again, stay tuned.

I checked in with iSmartAlarm earlier this month at CES 2015, in Las Vegas, and  was impressed by the sheer scope of what they've got planned for this year. Along with promises of new system components like a standalone smoke detector and a multisensor, the security startup announced a soon-to-be-released IFTTT channel and plans for compatibility with Nest, Thread and Apple's HomeKit.

Also promised for this year is a Z-Wave dongle that'll plug into the back of the CubeOne. Potentially, that'd open the door for a whole host of third party devices not currently compatible with iSmartAlarm. Most notable among these are smart locks, which ought to be an obvious point of focus for any smart security kit. To this end, iSmartAlarm's team claims to already be in talks with Kwikset, Yale and Schlage.

That all adds up to a pretty ambitious docket, and I'm curious to see if iSmartAlarm's team can actually pull all of it off on schedule. We've already seen  the yet-to-be-released Doorfront doorbell camera send them back to the drawing board, and the IFTTT channel has been in the works for some time now. As strong a system addition as the iCamera Keep seems to be, I wouldn't blame anyone who wanted to wait for iSmartAlarm to start delivering on its promises before plunking their $150 down.

We considered holding off on this review until iSmartAlarm's video storage options were ready, but given that the camera's already on sale, and that the rest of the features seem so polished, we pushed ahead. Even now, without the option to store or record video clips, the iCamera Keep works as a solid and reliable system component, and as a perfectly decent standalone IP camera, at least for basic monitoring.

At a retail price of $150, the iCamera Keep is a definite upgrade over the original iCamera, and also a strong budget alternative to costlier options like Piper NV and Dropcam Pro. Both of those offer a stronger slate of features, but for many, I think the iCamera Keep's simple approach will be enough, especially given that it works so well.

Still, an awful lot hinges on how well the iCamera Keep is ultimately able to manage video clips. In the event of a burglary, I think most consumers want their camera to start recording, and to hopefully get a good glimpse of who it is that's breaking in. For now, the iCamera Keep can't do that. If you can live without that feature, we like this camera quite a bit, but if you'd rather wait for iSmartAlarm to deliver on that new version of the app before buying in, rest assured that we'll update this review as soon as it drops."
Wink Relay review:|"

For a not-insignificant $300, the Wink Relay will bring controls for all your Wink network-compatible smart home products to a single, hard-wired touchscreen mounted on your wall. This isn't novel to home automation, even old systems from the 1980s had in-wall control screens. The Wink Relay is just one of the first for this new era of the off-the-shelf, generally mobile device-dependent, smart home.

That mobile device-dependency is one of the issues the Relay wants to address. It also wants to be more than just a glorified on/off switch. Built-in sensors can give you information about temperature, and humidity in the Relay's immediate surroundings. A built-in speaker and microphone will eventually let you use multiple Relays as an intercom system. The microphone also offers the promise of future voice control support.

One problem with Relay is that by putting controls in one place, anyone in your home can interact with the smart devices you have installed. If you don't want to expose everything? Tough luck. A lack of customization options means you don't get enough say over what appears on the Relay's screen.

It also doesn't live up to its full potential out of the box. Interactions with certain devices are, for various reasons, limited. It's also hard to stomach the $300 asking price when the microphone and speaker don't do much yet.

In-wall control screens seem like an obvious, inevitable component in the smart home, and the Relay may mature into a worthwhile investment. I just can't recommend that you buy one right now, given its price and the fact that it has some growing up to do.

You can consider the Relay an advanced smart home product, since installing it requires removing a light switch and then wiring-in the Relay in its place. You can mount the Relay in a single or double switch box, and two mechanical buttons on the Relay panel can act as replacements for the light switches you're taking out. The also provide the added bonus of bringing the lights connected to those switches online.

If you're comfortable flipping a circuit breaker and can follow a wiring diagram, you should be able to install the Relay yourself. Wink provides some basic instruction in its small paper manual, but what it doesn't spell out explicitly is that wiring must include a neutral wire in addition to the line and load wires. The manual instead instructs you to call Wink's help line if you don't have a neutral wire, which seems to leave open the possibility of a workaround. Talking with a Wink support tech revealed only that the neutral wire is indeed required.

With the Relay's wired panel in place, you'll see a small green LED come on once you restore power to the switch box. You can then test the power to each mechanical switch via a pair of buttons. Finally, you snap on the touchscreen portion of the Relay, along with a filler plate on the back to provide further support against any open socket behind it. An electrical contact transfers power between the wired piece and the touchscreen plate.

If you did it all right, the Relay's screen should power on automatically. Getting the Relay online, your next step, is as simple as selecting your WiFi network and entering any password you have via the onscreen keyboard. It worked for me on my home network on the first try.

Here's where the name ""Relay"" makes sense. You don't actually set anything else up via the Relay directly. Instead, the Relay will simply mirror whatever devices you've tied to your Wink mobile app or to your  Wink Hub . They show up as large icons on the Relay in the same way they appear on your phone. If you want to add any new devices to your network, you'll need to add them to the app, not to Relay directly. There's also no way to customize which devices show up on the Relay and which don't.

If you don't want everyone in your home to see your DropCam feed or to have the ability to control your thermostat settings, right now the only way to remove those things from the Relay is to remove them from your Wink network entirely.

You can still interact with those devices remotely via their own apps, but it makes the Relay feel too much like a dumb screen that you don't get more granular control over it. You also can't adjust simple things on the screen like brightness, or the order in which the various control icons appear. The only real setting you can change on the Relay itself is whether it comes on based on your proximity, or via a tap on the screen.

The list of devices that will work with your Relay is limited to those that work with the Wink network. Some will work with the Relay directly, some, for now, require that you also have a Wink Hub. Fortunately, compatible device list is pretty decent. Notables include the  Nest Learning Thermostat  and  Protect smoke/CO detector , smart light bulbs from  GE  and the  Philips Hue  line, as well as the  DropCam Pro , the Honeywell WiFi Smart Thermostat, and the  Chamberlain MyQ Garage  opener. You'll also find an assortment of smart locks, outlet adapters, wall switches and sensors, as well as  a whole array of Wink-made accessories as well, some of which won't be on the market until later this year.

To Wink's credit, it has clearly made an effort to incorporate  some of the more popular smart home accessories, but when you start playing around with their settings in the Wink app (and thus put them on Relay) you'll find that interactions with some of them are very limited.

Philips Hue lights won't let you put multiple lights in a group on Wink right now. That means, annoyingly, you have to control any Hue lights on your Relay or in the Wink app individually. You can't set your MyQ Garage to open and close based on your location, although you can use location to trigger behavior in other devices. Your DropCam will only send an image to the Relay once every 15 seconds, rather than showing you a real-time feed like you get on the DropCam app.

Wink says all of these limitations are mandated by the device makers. Those limits could change over time, and Wink also says similar devices from its own product line and those from other manufacturers will have expanded capabilities. Still, the fact remains that if you buy Relay (or use the free Wink app), you won't be able to control some smart home devices with it as well as you might expect or want.

The Relay, and the Wink network in general is hardly the first tech product with that kind of a problem, of course. Wink also isn't necessarily to blame for any of those partner-imposed issues, and in the grand scheme of things it's better to have some kind of interaction with those devices than none at all.

In addition to controlling devices around your house individually, the Relay will also import any grouped actions you've set up in the Wink App, called short cuts. You could call a short cut ""Night mode"" for example, and tell your lights to turn off, your garage door to close, and your DropCam to come on. The interactions again err towards simple here, arguably to a fault depending on how much automation you're after. You can't alter specific settings via shortcut on most devices, like putting the DropCam into night vision mode.

The last piece that hurts the Wink's value proposition right now is that it ships with a microphone and a speaker that don't currently do anything. Wink says eventually they'll let you use multiple Relays as an intercom system in your house. You can also imagine sound-based triggers coming into play, as well as voice commands.

Wink is not a certified partner for  Apple HomeKit or a member of Nest Labs'  Works with Nest program, so any voice control system would require Wink to either establish those relationships, sync up with another voice-based input system, or make its own in-house. It's anyone's guess which way Wink will go. And the bottom line right now is you still need to pay $300 for a device that doesn't live up to the potential of its hardware right now.

It's hard not to feel like Wink and its parent company Quirky pushed the Relay out to market to hit a pre-Holiday 2014 release date. I don't want to condemn it too harshly. The potential is there for the Relay to become a robust smart home control center. But with the pending launch of HomeKit-compatible hardware later this quarter, as well as the generally fast pace of the smart home market at-large, paying this much up-front for an underachieving product is a needless risk. The likelihood of something better coming along in the next six months is simply too great.

You could arguably say that about any smart home product right now, but we've seen plenty of devices that either work so well or offer so much out-of-the-box--the DropCam Pro, the Nest Learning Thermostat, the MyQ Garage, Icontrol's new  Piper NV , that it's easy to imagine living with them with minimal buyer's remorse. I don't get the same feeling about the Relay in its current state, although I will gladly revisit this review if Wink updates the Relay meaningfully over the next few months."
Icontrol Networks Piper NV review:|"

One of the beautiful things about DIY home security is that it champions piecemeal installation -- you can grab a  SmartThings  hub for 99 bucks, the brand's own open/close sensor for another $54, a  Dropcam Pro  for $199 and a  Schlage Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt  for $215 and you've just designed a security system beyond traditional brand-specific confines.

That's a great option when being loyal to one company means settling for less. But every so often, a system comes so close to the ""complete package"" that there's no need to bother with the third-party search for something better.

Icontrol Networks' Piper NV comes close to this ideal; it has tons of features, no monthly fees, a 2-minute setup and a responsive app. For a solid, self-contained DIY security system that works when you need it, I'd highly recommend the NV, which sells for $269 or £230 (it's yet to be made available in Australia, but that converts to around AU$440).

Like Icontrol's original  Piper , its new NV model is available in either a glossy white or black finish. I really liked the look of the original Piper and the NV isn't any different. So many home security and automation products look fine, but fall more on the utilitarian side of things; they're housed in a boring hunk of plastic and it's tough to distinguish one brand's device from another.

The NV feels different. Yes, it's still a hunk of white or black plastic, but it's a thoughtfully designed one. From its graceful lines to the sturdy stand that snaps into place, every inch of the NV makes sense.

That's even more impressive when you consider its multitude of features, which begs the question: how did the team ever manage to shove so many useful things into the sleek and minimal NV? It's efficient, understated, elegant even.

Here's an overview of all the things this minimal-footprint-device can do. It has a camera, a siren, a microphone, a speaker and a Z-Wave hub, as well as motion, sound, temperature, humidity and light sensors. The accompanying Piper Android and iOS apps allow you to arm and disarm the system, set custom alerts, watch live footage on a single or four-panel screen, view the free saved clips triggered by your own settings preferences, check out graphs showing all of the changes the sensors detect over time, add Z-Wave devices like smart plugs, sensors, locks, thermostats and more.

A lot of things are similar, if not identical to Icontrol's first Piper, but a couple of key tweaks take the NV from a great product to an exceptional one. Unlike Piper 1.0, this version has night vision; in fact, the ""NV"" stands for new version and night vision to denote this major feature upgrade.

Icontrol showcased the NV at CES earlier this month and I had the opportunity to speak with Piper co-founder Russell Ure. He mentioned the challenges of designing night vision for a 180-degree fish-eye lens, which explains the slight visual differences between the version 1.0 and NV cameras. Icontrol also boosted the camera's sensor from 2.0 megapixels on the original Piper to 3.4 megapixels on the Piper NV, as well as adding a snappier processor and an updated Z-Wave hub that can accommodate more devices while simultaneously improving overall security.

I had the NV up and running in roughly 2 minutes and a Jasco Z-Wave Plug-In Appliance Module in a minute flat. Setup was as simple as plugging in the Piper NV, connecting to the Piper Wi-Fi network and then entering the details for the local Wi-Fi network. To add a Z-Wave device, visit the Controls section of the app and let it walk you through the process. For the Jasco device, setup involved finding an obliging wall outlet and pressing the plug's center button once. Presto.

From there, I set custom rules for Home, Away and Vacation mode and created a rule for the Jasco plug, which I connected to a nearby table lamp.

In Home, Away and Vacation mode, motion, sound and indoor temperature changes can trigger a response from your NV. Within each mode and for each specific trigger, you can opt in and out of recording a video clip (it typically records an event for about 35  seconds), getting alerted via push message, phone call, email and/or text, notifying your trusted circle (you can add family and friends using your phone's contact directory) and sounding the siren.

I signed up for various iterations of these rules and received push messages, calls, emails and texts promptly and was able to review saved video clips from the Recordings section of the app. I added contacts to the trusted circle list, who confirmed that they received notifications. And, I enabled the 105-decibel siren. This was a less enjoyable test, as it proved to be fairly deafening, but that's good news if you're looking to scare and disorient an intruder.

With the Jasco plug, I set it to turn on whenever the ambient light sensor sensed that the room was dark; it worked very well. I also had the option to schedule it to turn on or off automatically, but the app doesn't let you itemize by day. Instead, it was by weekday or weekend, an oversight since plenty of people don't stick to the same schedules day by day.

The night vision also worked well, although standing too close made it tougher to distinguish features. I also detected a slight difference between the quality of the 2.0-megapixel original Piper versus the new 3.4-megapixel sensor. Of course, you have the option of raising or lowering the camera's streaming resolution if bandwidth is proving problematic.

This type of product is relatively new to the DIY market. Both the original Piper and a similar product called  Canary  were introduced via crowdfunding back in 2013. We haven't reviewed the $249 Canary yet, but Ry Crist has spent some hands-on time with a beta version and found it to be tough to setup and lacking some important features, like an auto-siren when a security event is triggered and protocol integrations.

Like the previous Piper, the NV doesn't have an IFTTT channel, it doesn't work with any specific third-party products that speak Z-Wave and Icontrol hasn't announced any particular partnerships with HomeKit, Wink, SmartThings or Nest. It also doesn't offer face recognition, something recently unveiled in beta for the $150  ArcSoft Simplicam . But, Icontrol has hinted at some upcoming features that might change all that.

That does limit its role in the larger smart-home scene, but its massive fish-eye lens, Z-Wave integration and impressive number of alert customizations, plus the improved optics and addition of night vision makes the $269 Piper NV a fantastic all-in-one security and automation system. I would recommend the NV to anyone looking for a reliable wide-angle view to cover the vulnerable spots at home."
Cree Connected LED Bulb review:|"

Cree was hesitant to add a smart bulb to its best-selling LED lineup, but that changed this year with the addition of the $15 Cree Connected LED. Sharing the build and lighting specs of last year's well-reviewed  Cree 4Flow LED , the new Connected LED adds in a Zigbee radio. Pair it with a control hub, and you'll be able to turn it on and off remotely, or schedule automated lighting changes.

At launch, Cree's smart bulb was somewhat married to the  Wink Hub , which made sense given that you'll buy both off the shelf at Home Depot. Since then, however, we've seen official support roll out for additional control gateways, including  SmartThings  and the  Philips Hue Bridge . You can add the bulbs to the new D-Link version of the  Staples Connect Hub , too, although there isn't official, Zonoff-certified support just yet.

The bulb works well across all of the platforms we've tested it with, and it shares the strong lighting specs of the 4Flow LED that came before it.  Most appealing is the price. At $15 -- just a few dollars more than you'll spend on non-connected competitors -- it ties with the  GE Link LED  as the most inexpensive connected bulb on the market. For basic automated lighting, it's the best option we've tested yet, and our current Editors' Choice winner.

Cree adapted its smart bulb design from last year's 4Flow LED, packing a Zigbee radio into the existing build. That means that this isn't a bulb that goes out of its way to look fancy or newfangled -- instead, it copies the 4Flow's emphasis on mimicking the silhouette of classic incandescents.

I liked that approach with the 4Flow, and I like it with the new Connected LED too, though some might find the plastic build to be a bit cheap-looking, especially when the bulb is turned off.

The new bulb also shares the 4Flow's convection cooling trick, which uses vents to circulate air through the body of the bulb, eliminating the need for heat sinks. That helps bring production costs down, and also means that the bulb is exceptionally light for an LED, weighing in at less than 2 ounces.

The Cree Connected LED shares the same lighting specs as the 4Flow LED, too, and that's largely a good thing. Both claim a light output of 815 lumens, and both clocked in even higher than that in front of our spectrometer -- 835 lumens for the 4Flow, and a very impressive 872 for the Connected LED.

In terms of efficiency, the 4Flow puts its light out using 11 watts, but the number rises to 11.5 watts for the Connected LED on account of the Zigbee radio's power draw. When we tested it out, the number was actually closer to 11.1 watts, so Cree's done a good job of keeping this bulb relatively efficient. Still, it's worth noting that both the  Philips Hue Lux LED  and the  Belkin WeMo LED  are even more efficient, each one drawing less than 10 watts.

Cree also did a very good job with color temperature here, landing extremely close to the stated 2,700K. At 2,696K, the Cree Connected LED lands closer to the mark than any other smart bulb we've tested, so if you're picky about that perfect shade of warm, yellowy light, you'll like this LED.

The one place where Cree's smart bulb lags behind at least some of the competition is the color rendering score, which measures how accurately a given light source illuminates different shades. The Cree Connected LED hits a rather ordinary score of 80 out of 100, and given that both the WeMo LED and the equally inexpensive  GE Link LED  hit closer to 90, I'd have liked to see Cree do better.

To access the Cree LED's smart features, you'll need to pair it with a control hub that can translate its Zigbee signal into Wi-Fi. Like the GE Link LED, the Cree Connected LED came out the gate trumpeting Wink support at launch, but soon expanded its third party compatibility to include options like  SmartThings,  Staples Connect , and the  Philips Hue Bridge .

Different platforms offer different features -- SmartThings and Philips bring IFTTT support into the picture, for instance -- but in general, the automating experience is largely the same. We tested the bulb on multiple platforms, and never ran into any difficulties pairing it or controlling it.

Regardless of which platform you're using, you'll be able to turn the Cree Connected LED on or off remotely, dim it, or automate it using whatever controls your system offers. These likely include setting the lights to a timed schedule, or syncing them up with things like motion sensors.

The bulb paired easily with each of the above-mentioned platforms. Wink and SmartThings both have dedicated settings and pairing instructions for the Cree LED right in the app, which helps. Staples Connect doesn't offer device-specific support for Cree just yet, but it was able to detect the bulb as a generic Zigbee device on the first try.

Syncing the Cree LED with a Philips Hue setup was pretty painless, too, although I needed to manually reset the bulb during the pairing process in order to help the bridge find it. Doing so isn't tricky -- just turn the bulb on for 2 seconds, then off for 2 seconds a total of four times.

First things first: as a light bulb, the Cree Connected LED is perfectly decent. Even if you don't own a hub and don't plan on buying one quite yet, you could buy Cree's smart bulb, use it as a plain ol' dumb bulb, and -- for the most part -- be quite happy with it.

I say ""for the most part"" because of the bulb's dimming capabilities. The 4Flow LED that the Connected LED is modeled after worked very well with dimmer switches, and was capable of dialing the light up and down without flicker or buzz. Since they're more or less identical, you might expect that the Connected LED would follow suit.

Dimmer switch compatibility goes out the window, however, when bulbs come with smart dimming mechanisms of their own, and the Cree Connected LED is no exception. Try and dim it using a dimmer switch, and the two dimming mechanisms will clash, causing moderate to severe buzz and flicker. It's a minor concern given that the in-app dimming is smooth, simple and free of both flicker and buzz, but still, it's something to be aware of.

Despite compatibility with multiple platforms, Cree still prints pairing instructions with Wink right on the packaging. Connecting Cree's smart bulbs with the Wink app was an easy process: just tell the app you want to add a Cree Connected LED to your setup, then turn the bulb on when it tells you to. Pairing the bulbs worked on the first try in each and every one of my tests, and never took longer than a minute from start to finish. That's a great result, and also a relief, quite frankly. The GE Link LEDs I tested last year each took several attempts before they'd pair successfully, which got real frustrating real quick.

The one issue I did experience during the pairing process had nothing to do with the bulbs themselves, but instead, with the hub. Wink required me to update the hub to the newest firmware before it'd let me add Cree bulbs to my setup. Sounds simple enough, but it took several attempts on three different Wi-Fi networks before I could finally get the update to install correctly.

Once your Wink Hub is up to date and your bulbs are paired, the app experience is a good one. Basic control of the lights is intuitive -- just tap a bulb to turn it on or off, or swipe right or left to dim it up or down. Other platforms offer controls that are similar, if not borderline identical.

Automation is also pretty painless thanks to Wink's Robots feature, which does an excellent job of walking you through the process. You can set your lights to turn on or off whenever certain conditions are met -- arriving at home, or triggering a motion sensor, for instance. In my tests, the Robot automations worked perfectly as far as Cree's bulbs were concerned. I was especially happy to see the app do well with geofencing automations that detected when my phone entered or exited the area immediately around my apartment -- these types of automations didn't work out so well when I tested the  Quirky Aros Smart Air Conditioner  last year.

In addition to remote controls and Robot creation, you can create shortcuts -- saved presets for multiple lights and devices that you trigger all at once with a single tap. For instance, a ""Movie Mode"" shortcut might dim a number of lights down to a nice, low level for those late-night Netflix binges.

You can also schedule timed lighting changes, then view all of your scheduled automations in a handy calendar view. If you want to control multiple lights at once, you can group them together. Additionally, you can view an activity timeline for your whole system, and see who changed what, when.

As said earlier, you'll find similar controls on other platforms, too, and in my tests, Cree's LED always worked well. I did detect some occasional latency with automated lighting changes on Staples Connect, and experienced similar lag with the GE Link LED. Both bulbs aren't officially supported yet, but Zonoff tells me they're testing them now and expect to certify them soon. Once they do, expect the hub's code to be better optimized to eliminate those laggy automations.

Your other big-name control options are SmartThings and Philips Hue. Both bring IFTTT support into the conversation, and both boast open APIs and robust third-party compatibility. Like Staples Connect, SmartThings offers direct interaction with things like motion detectors, which for some might make it a more appealing pick than Philips Hue.

Cree's original LED  leapfrogged much of the competition when it debuted in the beginning of 2013, and now, the Cree Connected LED looks primed to follow suit. At $15 per bulb, it offers better value than the  Osram Lightify  and  Connected by TCP  starter kits, a much better value than  Belkin's WeMo LEDs  or the  Philips Hue Lux LEDs , and better performance than the equally affordable  GE Link LED , too.

You'll need a third-party hub in order to control the bulbs, but you've got a good range of options at this point, and Cree meshes well with all of them. Even if you aren't sold on the smart home yet, Cree's Connected LEDs only cost a few dollars more than non-connected competitors, and perform well even when you aren't putting their smarts to work. That makes buying now and automating later a reasonable approach, so long as your home doesn't use dimmer switches.

Smart lighting is one of the clearest inroads to wider smart home adoption. By focusing on wide third-party compatibility, strong ease of use, and a low price point, Cree's positioned its Connected LED to move the needle, just as the company did with LEDs at large back in 2013. Make no mistake -- this is the smart bulb to beat."
Let Neeo wrangle all of your household electronics|"

Neeo takes on other smart home hubs with its minimalist design and its ability to translate an assortment of common protocol languages -- Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, ZigBee,  Thread. And, instead of just offering a dedicated Android and iOS app, Neeo also has a physical remote.

While Neeo claims to work with ""tens of thousands"" of devices, it specifically names  Apple TV, GE, Sonos,  Honeywell ,  Nest,  Philips Hue , Yale, Roku and cable boxes from brands like Comcast and Verizon as fully integrated partners. Still, Neeo hasn't confirmed that these third-parties products actually work with the hub or if they simply fall under the umbrella of compatible protocols, a significant distinction.

Its built-in infrared tech does suggest broad TV and audio compatibility, though, as you can find the same standard across brands like Sony, Samsung, GE, Sharp, Panasonic and Vizio (Actually, Neeo says its hub can work with 55,000 TVs and 19,000 DVD/BlueRay players, but I'll spare you, and myself, from that massive list).

If Neeo delivers on its smart home/entertainment integration promises, it will be a lot more comprehensive than today's ""universal remotes.""

An entire household worth of gadgets would be accessible from a single source, ensuring that you can control your TV, music player, smart thermostat, lock, lights and more -- all from Neeo's streamlined interface. This sure sounds like good news, as it suggests an end to the annoying app-and-remote-shuffling that inevitably happens as you buy new electronic devices with companion controllers.

The remote itself is made of aluminum and features a 3.2-inch, 480-by-800-pixel touchscreen. Supposedly, the display can distinguish between users based on touch, so your preferred settings should populate whenever you grab the remote. The battery is also designed to last for several months on a single charge and you can set the remote to send out a distress signal (through the app) if it gets lost.

Neeo is new to Kickstarter as of today, so there's plenty of time to snag one. Prices start at $148 for a hub and at $199 for a hub and a remote, with an extra $10 charge for US shipping and an extra $18 charge for international shipping. Availability is slated for March."
Yetu wants to put all your smart-home devices on a single platform|"

LAS VEGAS -- If you have a collection of smart home devices from a variety of different manufacturers, then Yetu might be the product you're looking for.

Yetu is a combination of a hardware product -- the physical gateway box -- and a software platform, which aims to provide a single interface for all your connected devices and appliances, regardless of their respective operating systems and standards, although it's a little unclear exactly how the product will accomplish this.

The gateway itself connects to your network and has an HDMI output so you can connect your TV and access the interface on that via an included remote control, but it also works across tablet, smartphone and PC. This means a single UI for things like your  Hue  lightbulbs, connected thermostat, energy monitoring devices and much more.

In a quick demo at the Showstoppers event here at CES, a Yetu representative showed us how a user could easily access an online video service such as Netflix or YouTube via the PC interface, but choose watch it directly on the TV. While watching the video, the demonstration showed how a connected doorbell ringing could automatically freeze the video, show an image of the person at the door via a camera then let you open the door if you have a smartlock.

Yetu is a German company and it showed off the device at IFA towards the end of last year. The CES 2015 showing is its official launch into the US market, although no firm pricing or dates were available.

We'll be keeping an eye on this as it gets a wider release to see just how Yetu actually performs in a real test environment."
Oomi puts its Cube on tap to run your smart home at CES|"

Editor's note: Updated 1/21/2015 to include packages and pricing information announced with the launch of Oomi's Indiegogo campaign.

LAS VEGAS -- Among rows of smart home startups at CES, the Oomi Cube caught my eye. It's the central piece of a complete system that can monitor your home, control your TV, manipulate your lights and your electronics, and act as a central hub for a variety of third-party devices. Oomi's system is well rounded, and it uses near-field communication (NFC) to make adding pieces to it as simple as a tap.

The Oomi Indiegogo campaign launches today to help them fund final development and manufacturing. Contributors can get a big discount off of the retail price of Oomi with a $229 kit including the Oomi Cube, the Oomi Touch, and the Oomi Plug. The same package will be $449 at retail. At CES, especially for a product shown before its crowdfunding campaign, the hardware looked complete and functional, and it all revolves around that Oomi Cube.

The Oomi Cube has an HD lens so it can act as a connected security camera. Via Oomi's app, you'll be able to view live streaming footage and set up alerts based on motion and sound. It detects vibration as well, so if everything works seamlessly, you can rest easily knowing the Oomi Cube can keep an eye on what you can't.

Like  Piper , it goes beyond just being a camera, and has antennas to help it receive signals from smaller sensors. It's a built in Z-wave hub, and you'll be able to expand it to receive ZigBee as well.

Thus, Oomi's well set up for interoperability. They mention  Nest ,  Dropcam , and  Philips Hue  in the marketing material. Oomi wants to unify and simplify scattered third-party pieces. Again, that's a common goal, one that bigger companies like  Insteon  still adamantly strive to complete. But Oomi at least has the specs to keep up as a viable new hub.

Finally, the impressively versatile Cube detects temperature, humidity, and light so you can use it to track the internal conditions of your home while it keeps watch. And the Cube acts as an IR remote control so it can send a signal to your TV or other compatible devices. It's not just limited to receiving data.

If you have an established smart home, the Oomi Cube positions itself with antennas and camera specs to fit right in and help you simplify. If you're just getting started with home automation, Oomi offers a number of other first-party products to get you up and running in earnest.

The Oomi Plug goes into an outlet and lets you remotely control any electronic you power with it. Similar to the  Belkin WeMo Switch  and any number of smart switches, it monitors energy usage while expanding your connectivity to an otherwise isolated machine.

Oomi also offers a connected color-changing bulb and an air sensor, all of which have customizable widgets in their app.

Finally, the Oomi Touch is a dedicated Android tablet that helps you get everything up and running quickly. It uses NFC so you can expand your Oomi system with a simple touch.

With a camera and a hub, a light bulb, a plug, and a dedicated tablet, Oomi's dipping their toes into a lot right at launch. So far, the specs check out. If the pieces all work together as well as they did in the demonstration, and include third-party devices as part of a larger smart home, Oomi might just become an important player in connected technology when the devices are ready in August. At the very least, they have enough ambition to be one to watch."
Archos Kitchen Screen does your grocery shopping right out of the fridge|"

We've all been there: you get home after a long day, open the fridge for a refreshing snack / beverage -- and there's no milk/chocolate/booze. You/your significant other/your offspring finished it this morning and nobody remembered to get some on the way home. The Archos Kitchen Screen is designed to put an end to such fridge-based disasters.

Archos has teamed up with Freshub, a connected kitchen start-up, for the device, which is part of the French company's Smart Home system introduced last year. We  weren't keen on the Smart Home starter pack  for a number of reasons, so it'll be interesting to see if the Kitchen Screen addresses or adds to those issues when we get our hands on it.

The primary function of the Kitchen Screen is to keep track of what groceries you need and then shop for more items. When you're running out of something, you wave the near-empty packet or carton in front of the screen and it reads the barcode and adds the item to your grocery basket.

The Kitchen Screen is on show at CES 2015, the technology trade show held every January where the world's gadget manufacturers gather to show off their wares for the coming year. Specs, prices and the retailers that you can shop with are yet to be confirmed; we'll bring you more details of the device and the service when we've tried it out.

In the meantime, stick with CNET for all the first impressions, hands-on videos and glossy photos of the best of the rest technology coming your way in the new year."
Bemo wants to turn your old smart phone into a new smart thermostat|"

For lots of us, buying a new smartphone means selling our old one for pennies on the dollar. San Jose-based start-up Wise Labs, LLC thinks it has a better way with Bemo, a clever device designed to repurpose old smartphones into shiny new smart thermostats. Just install Bemo where your old thermostat used to be, download the free app to your old Android, iOS, or Windows device, then mount it in place on the wall.

Wise Labs is seeking its capital on Kickstarter, where backers can pre-order Bemo for $130 (about £80 in the UK, or just under AU$150 in Australia). A limited number of early-bird discounts are currently available, but even at full price, you'll be spending considerably less than you would for a dedicated smart thermostat like the  Nest , the  Honeywell Lyric , or the  Ecobee3 .

As an alternative, you can pre-order Bemo with an Android device included for $250 (about £155, or roughly AU$285). That price puts it right on par with existing competitors like Nest.

From the touchscreen to the built-in Wi-Fi, Bemo is designed to leverage your old smart phone's hardware into a smart thermostat experience that's both new and familiar. With Bemo's app, Wise Labs is promising the same sorts of features we've come to expect from today's top smart thermostats -- things like advanced scheduling, and geofenced HVAC automations that turn the heat off when you leave for work.

Along with those you'll find some new twists, too, like the ability to stream music or call 911 in an emergency. Wise Labs is also opening Bemo's software to outside developers, leaving the door open for even more creative applications of your existing phone tech.

Bemo is designed for the kinds of 24V HVAC systems found in the US, though the team at Wise Labs says they're working on a version for the 240V systems found in the UK, too. Compatibility beyond those two regions remains to be seen, though Wise Labs is offering to ship Bemo to international buyers, with units expected to arrive by August 2015.

With HomeKit software built into iOS 8 and Google building its smart-home vision around the Nest, the intersection of smartphone and thermostat seems like a natural crossroad for the connected home. That's right where Bemo sits, which seems like awfully smart positioning to me. We'll be sure to keep our eye on it in the coming year."
Foscam Plug and Play Wireless IP Camera FI9826P review:|"

Foscam's $220 (available in both the UK for £135 and in Australia for AU$230) Plug and Play Wireless IP Camera FI9826P is full of contradictions. It's a high-quality pan, tilt and zoom camera with night vision, two-way talk, an SD card slot and opt-in Cloud storage services. Despite these solid specs, its web interface is extremely antiquated and downright DIY-unfriendly; unfortunately, you have to navigate it to successfully sign up for email notifications and to make a bunch of other camera-related settings adjustments.

Tack on the mobile app's lack of push notifications and the FI9826P's initial promise fades fast. Since it delivers in terms of optics, it will work as a live-streaming solution. But, both the Web and mobile app need major design overhauls to match the real-time, DIY-security-camera-style of Foscam's closest competition.





The FI9826P is a hefty 1.8-pound camera that's available in either black or white.  If your router has a Wi-Fi Protected Setup button (WPS), you can connect it wirelessly. Otherwise you're stuck tethering the camera to the router via the included Ethernet cable. I went the WPS route and experience a few hiccups early on.

The ""quick installation guide"" walks you through a series of steps -- pressing the WPS button on the camera and on the router, downloading the Foscam Viewer app on your Android or iOS device (there are several unofficial Foscam apps, Foscam viewer is the one you want), scanning the QR code on the bottom of the camera (quite a balancing act) and registering with a unique username and password.

This process was pretty confusing. I created a username and a password only for it to return an error message: ""Login Fail: Username or Password Incorrect."" Apparently, you have to log in the first time with Foscam's default username, admin, and no password. Then, it gives you the chance to update your info, but I had to reset the camera before it actually accepted my new username and password.

From there, I was able to access live streaming in either single-or-quadrant-view (great if you have multiple cameras running simultaneously). I was also able to record video, take snapshots, pan, tilt, zoom, set night vision and enable audio for two-way talk.

It also has an ""Enable Push Message"" option for motion-related security events, but I wasn't having any luck getting it to work. Foscam confirmed that push alerts are not currently available on the Foscam Viewer app (either for Android or iOS users), but that a new app should be coming out within the month that will offer this feature. How odd.



While the FI9826P has some pretty good specs, the mobile app's missing push alerts seriously limit that whole remote access thing. And the Web app isn't any better. In fact, it was the most perplexing part of this so-called ""plug-and-play"" camera.

The Web app doesn't function like the intuitive ones we've seen from other brands, where you use the same username and password from the mobile app and simply sign in via the brand's website. No. The process was much more convoluted and not for the DIY faint of heart -- not exactly difficult, but certainly not straightforward. Fortunately, Foscam has a series of tutorials for Web app setup.

Configuration will vary depending on the type of computer you're using, but I had to download something called the IP Camera Tool and make sure that my computer was on the same Wi-Fi network as the camera itself. Then, I had to confirm the camera's IP address, Subnet Mask and Http port and add in Gateway and DNS Server details. From there, I was assigned a unique IP-based URL that I was able to use as my camera's custom Web address.

Of course, that means that you can't use the Web app when you're outside of the home network's range. But, you can use the newly configured Web app to opt in to email notifications -- that's the only feature that makes the FI9826P even remotely reliable as an on-the-go security monitor. It required a similarly tedious series of steps, though.

If you have some level of familiarity with routers, these steps may not slow you down much. It helped that Foscam's support section is fairly extensive, but it really shouldn't be that complicated -- especially when you consider Dropcam, Samsung and other close competitor's comparatively intuitive apps.

Here's the good news: Once everything was set up, it worked really well. The Web app lets you make all sorts of adjustments to the pan, tilt and zoom features as well as set zones and schedules for the motion alert emails. The emails were delivered promptly and included three different photos taken when the motion sensor was triggered. Sometimes the photos captured the cause of the motion alert and other times it missed -- pretty good, but not as reliable as a push alert or a push alert and an email.

The live streaming in day and night vision mode in both apps were stellar. And Foscam gives you the option between SD card storage (up to 32 GB) and Cloud services, which range from free (30 minutes of live streaming, saves up to 30 clips or 100 images) to $50/month (unlimited live streaming, saves a month of clips and 100,000 images).

In addition to its old-school interfaces, the Foscam FI9826P doesn't have an IFTTT channel, protocol integrations or third-party partnerships. That's another way that names like Dropcam and Samsung have Foscam beat. By staying true to its passé ""IP camera"" name, Foscam is really missing out on a lot of potential action in the smart-home sector.

At $220 (£135, AU$230), the FI9826P seems to offer an exceptional value. It shares a lot of features with other Wi-Fi cameras we've reviewed, but its pan, tilt and zoom functionality really stood out. Sadly, even impressive specs don't matter much when you can't rely on its apps to provide the information you need when you need it. Hopefully, Foscam's next round of app updates will add that usability factor that's sorely missing and then I'll be able to reevaluate its ability to compete as a DIY home security camera."
D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Camera review:|"

Being able to see your home from anywhere and confirm that everything is okay with your own eyes makes a device like the $120 D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Camera seem extremely useful. (The same model sells in the UK for about £80, and in Australia for AU$200.) D-Link's camera with the unwieldy name does well in this regard. The 640x480 resolution isn't great, but it's enough to clearly see what's going on. And the ability to manually look around the room from afar by panning, tilting, and zooming the camera worked well and can help you check every nook and cranny.

If you can't keep your eyes on your home, though, don't expect D-Link to help. Aside from the live viewing, the camera promises features that should allow it to function as a sentry, alerting you when something unexpected happens. Unfortunately, these video and sound notifications are unwieldy at best and completely non-functioning at worst. None of the detection features are reliable enough to actually help with security, so you'll want to look elsewhere for that elusive peace of mind.

Initially, I was quite hopeful for the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Camera. It offers a promising mix of features, especially for its price, and without any monthly fees. Similar fee-free smart-home cameras include the  $200, Â£190 Dropcam Pro  (not yet available in Australia, but converts to about AU$230); the $200  US-only Piper ; the  $190, Â£160 Samsung SmartCam HD Pro  (not yet available in Australia, but converts to about AU$215); and the  $130, Â£130, AU$170 Belkin NetCam HD+ .

The more expensive cameras all offer better resolution than D-Link and wider viewing angles to boot. Samsung, Dropcam, and Piper have a full 1080p image with 128-degree, 130-degree, and 180-degree respective fields of view. Belkin only has 720p with a 95-degree viewing angle, but D-Link's picture maxes out at 640x480 with a 66-degree horizontal viewing angle. Next to the Belkin camera, the D-Link's narrower viewing angle feels especially underwhelming.

However, it makes up for the smaller viewing angle by allowing you to remotely turn and tilt the camera. With night vision, a built-in microphone (though not two-way audio), and alerts for both motion and sound, D-Link gets back to being quite competitive on features, especially if you don't feel the need to monitor your home in high definition.

To top it off, D-Link brought their prowess with Wi-Fi routers to the camera with a unique extender mode. This allows it to act as a mini-router and bring signal to previously unreachable areas of your home. I was excited for this feature in particular, and thought that if the D-Link cam could act as a router and an effective security camera, the $120 price point would make it a steal.

The camera looks sleek. An all white base holds the black rounded lens shell. It's not exactly inconspicuous, but I wouldn't call it outlandish either, and I didn't mind having it on my shelf. You won't have to worry about any physical construction, the camera comes assembled complete with a power cord, an ethernet cord, and a simple instruction manual. The box does include a bracket for mounting the camera to a wall so you can set up an optimal viewing angle.

Getting it set up on your home Wi-Fi network is a bit more involved, and requires that you use your Windows or  Mac  computer. A ""zero configuration"" page in the manual tells you how to skip most of the steps if you're also using a D-Link router. I was, and didn't get it to work right. The more complex steps necessary in that circumstance require you to download setup software and do some light configuration. Nothing proved too daunting, but this certainly isn't Wink's ""hold your phone near a sensor"" approach where you're done in a few seconds.

I was more than willing to jump through a few hoops in the set up for the promise of extra Wi-Fi range in addition to a smart security camera. Unfortunately, it didn't end up giving much of a boost.

For the mobile app, D-Link uses its old myDLink Lite app, rather than its new MyDLink Home app that debuted with its new  smart plug . The new app is supposed to let you control all of the D-Link products on your network, but for some reason that doesn't include support for this new camera.

Though first you'll need to get it up and running on your computer, you can then control the D-Link using either the website or the myDLink Lite app. I started playing around with its panning and tilting features. The range of motion impressed me, and I was successfully able to follow my coworkers around a room, listen to their conversations, and generally creep them out. I didn't really notice the lack of resolution until I zoomed in; standard definition looked sharp enough.

With the digital zoom, the clarity peels away and things get downright blurry at full 4x zoom. The camera itself doesn't zoom, so the function just makes the existing picture larger on your computer, and the lack of definition shines through.

At any time, you can snap a picture from the camera's viewpoint, so you can capture a special moment or an incriminating one. Just don't expect the zoom to show up in the snap. Because the zoom doesn't happen on the camera itself, even if you're computer's picture shows a tight view of your kid reaching for the cookie jar, the saved snapshot will be back at the full unzoomed view of the kitchen.

Controlling the pan-and-tilt action was another source of minor disappointment. On your browser, you have to manipulate the horizontal x-axis or the vertical y-axis individually, and the camera won't move until you release the slider. This makes getting to the right spot a guessing game. Fortunately, you can save a location once you find it, and automatically move the camera to that position with the click of a button.

Manipulating the view with the app proved slightly easier. It allows for intuitive swipes and pinches, though the lag between input on the app and movement of the camera still caused me a bit of frustration.

Overall, in terms of live viewing, the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Camera gave a competent showing and will allow you to spy on your family with reasonable clarity of picture and sound. But because the camera isn't inconspicuous and because the movement of panning and tilting isn't silent, don't expect to remain incognito while you watch.

While it can grant you peace of mind with a visual check-in, the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night camera proves almost completely useless at keeping an eye on things while you can't. The customizable alerts and automatic recordings should allow this, but they don't work consistently.

You can tell the system what, when and how to monitor. The camera can't move on its own, but you can point it at your prized Han Solo figurine (not that I have one) and highlight an area. Then, set an alert only if there's motion in that particular spot between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. Similarly, you can set a decibel threshold for sound alerts and even movement sensitivity.

Getting the sensitivity levels where you want them is another guessing game. Sound is easier, as a scrolling graph shows the current levels in the room, but movement you'll just have to ballpark. Like the initial setup, this process needs to be done on the website, though you can turn the alerts on and off with the app.

I turned on email alerts and push notification on my phone and went to work triggering events... and nothing happened. For a full day, I screamed and danced in front of the camera hoping for it to send me something. Nothing. Worse, when I left it on for an extended period, the sound grew unusable, even with the live feed. All I could hear was loud, persistent feedback.

After unplugging it for a day and resetting it to factory settings, the sound managed to fix itself, but the alerts didn't. Randomly, with no input on my part, sound alerts started to happen the second time I left the camera plugged in for more than 24 hours. At that time, I also received the only push notification I would ever get. I could never get those to replicate, and motion detection still didn't function.

To get motion working, I had to go in to advanced settings, which require you to click at least two different warnings about the security of your computer, and download a specific video software driver. Finally, I was up and running, but the email alerts still proved slow and inconsistent and I never got another push notification.

I tried it with a replacement unit from D-Link, to rule out whether I had a faulty one, and experienced the same inconsistency. When I reached out to D-Link, they confirmed that they had replicated my problem and were ""looking into"" it.

While the alerts are problematic, the recording function doesn't work at all. The link in the email notification takes you to a page that should show you a video or snapshot of what caused the alert. Instead, it just takes you back to the live view. The recordings never once worked for me.

Thus, to catch someone using this camera, you either need to be watching, or you need to hope it was one of the times the email came through right way, then check your email, click the link, log-in to the server, confirm that you want to allow Java to run, and wait for the lag to catch up and the camera view to load. You'll basically need to hope your thief decides to stick around and have a cup of coffee.

The other DIY security cameras I mentioned earlier have different ways of integrating with other connected devices in your home. Piper doubles as a Z-wave hub and Dropcam has Bluetooth. The hope is to turn these cameras into the eyes of your smart home, so it'll know when to lock the doors and flash the lights if something is amiss. Piper even has a built-in siren that can let out a screech to send a potential thief running.

The best the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Camera can do to improve your smart home is add an underwhelming amount of extra Wi-Fi range. The idea was a good one. In practice, I checked the signal boundaries around the office, and found that no matter where I positioned the camera, I got a boost of a few extra feet at most. D-Link's cloud camera fails to be the comprehensive solution which its competitors offer.

D-Link's newest camera is an unrefined experience at best with its unpolished -- and sometimes non-functional -- software. Fortunately you have other reliable options from  Piper ,  Dropcam ,  Samsung , or even Belkin, with the similarly priced and much more competent  NetCam HD+ . They all cost a little more than the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Camera, but their reliability when it comes to security makes each more than worth it."
CoinGuard keeps track of what's important to you|"

The Pilot Labs CoinGuard is supposed to be a simple supplement to your existing home security setup. It's a small, coin-shaped sensor that you can attach to pretty much anything -- from a family heirloom to that box of cookies that's off-limits before dinnertime. Then, if someone tries to make off with that priceless piece of jewelry or a fistful of Oreos, you should get an instant push notification.

It reminds me somewhat of  Dropcam Tabs , those versatile motion sensors supposedly rated for indoor and outdoor use -- although Tabs seem to have fallen off the radar since Dropcam teamed up with Nest. CoinGuard is also reminiscent of  Sense Mother's  ""Cookies"" -- a cute name for its remote motion and temperature sensors. Cookies can attach to your laptop as easily as a door or window to alert you when something's amiss or simply to track ambient temperature.

CoinGuards looks similarly versatile.

Like Cookies, CoinGuards need a hub to translate the Wi-Fi signal. This unassuming hub has a single button for simple setup and variety of LED status indicators, including ZigBee, Pilot Labs' protocol of choice for this product. Each CoinGuard comes with a replaceable battery that it claims can last for more than a year and an operating range of over 300 feet. That's much better than Cookies -- they only have a 65-foot range.

The related iHomeWare app is only available for iOS right now, but an Android version is in the works. You should be able to arm and disarm multiple CoinGuards from the app and Pilot Labs' Cloud-based monitoring takes care of the push notification portion.

Pilot Labs' CoinGuard has an open API and expects to announce an IFTTT channel by the end of 2014. It also  has a variety of other in-house smart home products that should integrate seamlessly into the iHomeWare app, including smoke and carbon monoxide sensors, water leak sensors and more.

The CoinGuard Kickstarter campaign launched today, with prices for a hub and one CoinGuard sensor starting at $45 (roughly £28, AU$50). CoinGuards can be shipped internationally for an additional charge and Pilot Labs says it should be able to start sending out units as early as December."
This home security camera claims to work no matter what|"

Link-Union's founder, Andy Benatti, travels a lot. He tried out a variety of webcams to stay connected to his family while on the road, but felt that they all came up short in one way or another. So, he created his own version: the Link-U Hybrid SmartCam.

Most DIY home security cameras offer either local or remote storage. Samsung's $190, £160 SmartCam HD Pro (SD card local storage; not yet available in Australia, but converts to about AU$215) and Dropcam's $200, £190 Dropcam Pro (cloud server remote storage; not yet available in Australia, but converts to about AU$230) are two such examples. The Link-U comes with both -- an SD card slot (up to 32GB) and cloud access via Google or iCloud Drive.





The Link-U has another intriguing feature: Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity, thanks to an internal 3G/4G modem. This hybrid camera also has two power sources, a standard plug adapter and an 8-hour backup battery. That means that your camera should still function and the feed should still be accessible on the Android or iOS app even if your Wi-Fi cuts out and you lose power.

It also has Bluetooth LE. So, you should be able to connect a variety of smart home gadgets, although there aren't any specifics on third-party integrations just yet. This list of features sure seems astounding, especially when you consider that none of the models we've reviewed offer quite as many contingencies in case of spotty Wi-Fi/power outages/both.

The Link-U Hybrid SmartCam recently launched on Indiegogo and early backers can snag one for just $100, which converts to about £60 or AU$113 (the camera is expected to retail for $250 eventually, which converts to £155 or AU$285). The very first batch of production-ready models should ship in January 2015. Find out more on Link-Union's Indiegogo page."
Ecobee3 Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat, HomeKit-enabled review:|"

Editors' note, June 10, 2016: This review has been updated with details on IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, and Apple HomeKit integrations.

Editors' note, November 19, 2014: Ecobee recently released version 1.1.1 of its Ecobee3 app and adjusted the sensitivity of its touchscreen. I have since retested the thermostat and the text and overall score have been updated accordingly.

Toronto-based Ecobee may not have the name recognition of  	Honeywell or Nest, but it was actually the first company to come out with an app-enabled thermostat. Its initial line of smart thermostats was funneled through dealers though, which limited the brand's ability to compete in the do-it-yourself arena.

To satisfy this new market, the company has rolled out the $249 Ecobee3 (£155/AU$285), a DIY climate kit comprised of a Wi-Fi thermostat and a remote temperature sensor that work with  	IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit and more.  It doesn't quite have the same design appeal as Nest, but the Ecobee3 is a thermostat I can wholeheartedly recommend.

Your installation  	success will vary a lot depending on your HVAC system and your level of electrical wiring savvy. The ideal will have a five-wire system, in which case you can literally just swap out your old thermostat for your new Ecobee3.

If your HVAC unit only has four wires running to your thermostat, you're not out of luck, but you will have an extra step to deal with. The Ecobee3 requires a C (or Common) wire connection, which you won't find on a four-wire HVAC system. To get around this problem, Ecobee includes something called a Power Extender Kit with your purchase free of charge that does the work of the C wire without you actually having to add that pesky fifth wire yourself (or having to call an electrician to do it for you).

You will need to know your way around your HVAC system to install the Extender Kit, since you need to connect it directly to the controller board on your HVAC unit, provided yours is new enough to have one. If not, you can still reconfigure the wiring, but budding DIYers will likely want to call in some experienced help. Whether you use the Extender Kit or not, this all seems unnecessary given that the competing   	Honeywell Lyric  and  Nest Learning Thermostat  will both work fine on a four-wire system.

For my own installation, I had to go with the rewire option given my near 20-year old HVAC unit. I had help from Steve Conaway, one of our technical editors, who rewired my unit to give it a C wire. It worked, but it certainly wasn't convenient.

Once the Ecobee3 was installed, it recognized the wires I connected and walked me through the configuration process. This included adding my home Wi-Fi details, selecting Fahrenheit or Celsius -- all of the stuff you'd expect from an initial thermostat setup. I also paired the included remote sensor to the thermostat, which took about a minute. The remote sensor is a handy extra that comes with the Ecobee3. It essentially acts as a standalone ambient indoor temperature monitor you can put in another room. It can also tell the thermostat whether you're home or away.

Registration is the final hurdle between connecting your thermostat to the Web and mobile apps and enjoying the full functionality of your Ecobee3. The early production versions of both were extremely glitchy, but I revisited them about 6 weeks after the original review date. The  displays looks the same, but the wonky usability issues are gone. That means that you can expect a much breezier registration process and interaction with the apps overall.

Visually, the Ecobee3 looks nice enough, with a touchscreen rather than the radial dials we've seen lately with the Lyric and the Nest. The homescreen displays the mode -- whether you're in cool, heat, auto or off -- the percentage of indoor humidity, the current indoor temperature, a temperature slider for manual tweaks, and quick access to settings, home and away mode updates and the local forecast. It also has a built-in motion sensor that helps the thermostat detect whether you're home or away.

Unfortunately, the touchscreen was much less responsive than I'd like. The ""return to homescreen"" button in the top left was particularly stubborn and took several tries to respond on more than one occasion. Fortunately, Ecobee has since made adjustments to the touchscreen sensitivity and it no longer takes multiple tries to get the buttons to work.

Moving beyond the early usability issues I encountered with the touchscreen and the apps, this thermostat actually performed quite well. It responded quickly and accurately when I adjusted the temperate in person and from the apps. I really liked that I could access the local forecast information easily from the thermostat's homescreen. And, the Smart Home/Away and Follow Me features present intriguing alternatives to the Lyric's glitchy geofencing home/away modes and the Nest's algorithm-based learning.

While I entered in a schedule that approximated my regular home and away settings, the Smart Home/Away feature transformed the Ecobee3 from a regular programmable thermostat into something smart and adaptable. Basically, it works like this: I programmed the thermostat to be set to Away mode between 8am and 6pm, but happened to return home for lunch one day. The thermostat and remote sensor's built-in motion and proximity detectors were able to detect that I was in fact home and automatically switched back to Home mode.

The Follow Me feature was similarly useful. Like Smart Home/Away, this option relies on the thermostat and remote sensor's built-in sensors to pinpoint your location and figure out when to kick on your heating and cooling system to make you as comfortable as possible. And Ecobee's Home IQ feature provides a breakdown of the energy and money you're saving with your shiny new smart thermostat, similar to Nest's monthly energy reports.

The Ecobee3 has an IFTTT channel and partnerships with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Wink, SmartThings, and a handful of other third-party products. Please note: The original Ecobee3 thermostat does not work with HomeKit. Instead, you will have to buy the second-gen HomeKit-enabled model for integration with Siri.

With IFTTT, you can create rules like, ""If the Ecobee3 switches to either Home or Away mode automatically, then send me a notification,"" or ""If your phone leaves a specified geofence range, then set my Ecobee3 to Away mode."" The Alexa and HomeKit integrations add voice control into the mix, so you can say,""Alexa/Siri, set my thermostat to 75 degrees."" The Wink and SmartThings integrations offer opportunities for the Ecobee3 to be part of a multi-protocol smart home system.

Given Nest's relationship to Google and Honeywell's history as a leader in the heating and cooling industry, these sorts of alliances are integral to Ecobee's success -- and the team has steadily added new ones in tandem with the growth of the smart home market.

Ecobee's $249 Ecobee3 smart thermostat has a lot to offer, even more so now since its early glitches have been fixed. So after a bit of a shaky start, the Ecobee3 is now well worth your consideration. It has all of the features you want from a thermostat plus add-ons like the remote sensor and the Power Extender Kit. Adding in partnerships like Alexa and HomeKit as well as its availability in Apple and Best Buy stores make the Ecobee3 a major competitor in the smart thermostat arena.

I still prefer the well-rounded Nest Learning Thermostat for its superior design and usability, and because you don't have to use a C wire (or a special workaround) for the installation, but the Ecobee3 is the best choice if you want Apple HomeKit integration and a remote sensor to track any room-to-room temperature disparities."
Sense Mother review:|"

Sense's $300 Mother has been making the rounds at recent tech conferences and every time we spot those blank, lifeless eyes and ever so slightly upturned smile among the chaos we're unanimously struck by its sheer creepiness. Factor in Sense's bizarre branding messages -- ""Who takes care of you better than your mom? Mother only takes care of what you want. Here's Mother: she's like a mom, only better."" --and I'm thinking that I'd rather meet Hannibal Lecter in a dark alleyway than ""Mother.""

Since Sense's quirky smart home product just made the leap to production, we thought we'd suspend our initial design reservations and actually figure out what this thing does. And while I still haven't warmed to its aesthetics or in-your-face marketing, it all started to make a lot more sense when I began testing this (surprisingly) delightful home-automation kit.



Essentially, Mother is a data-tracker with a ton of built-in flexibility. Four ""Cookies,"" or remote sensors, come with your purchase and you can use them to monitor motion and temperature. Cookies communicate with the Mother hub and display all sorts of useful information on the related web and mobile apps -- up to 65 feet. When Cookies exceed 65 feet, they will continue to log data, but you won't be able to access it until you're back in range of Mother (See? Doesn't that just sound creepy?).

Yes, Sense's Mother is on the pricy side and the 65-foot range is a bit of a bummer, but this $300 kit is uniquely versatile, giving you the freedom to track pretty much anything from how many steps you walk in a day to how well you sleep at night.

Mother is a bulbous, glossy white hub that's shaped like a bowling pin or a Russian nesting doll. Connect it directly to your Wi-Fi router via the included Ethernet cable and follow the instructions on the Web app to register it and pair its four colorful motion-and-temperature-sensing Cookies.

This process was simple enough, but did nothing to counter our first impressions of Mother.

Each hub has a unique identifier, but instead of a 24-digit alphanumeric code or some other randomly generated ID number, Mother has a name. Mine's called ""Elwanda Melinda"" -- certainly easier to type in than a long string of letters and numbers, but significantly weirder.

The same goes for each Cookie. The orange one is called ""United Sundae,"" the yellow one is called ""Adored Crunch,"" the green one is called ""Natural Connection,"" and the blue one is called ""Ideal Mountain.""

You can also change Mother's LED eye color during the initial setup and in settings afterwards. There are eight options, including blue, pink, light blue, yellow, green, purple, orange and red. I steered clear of red and opted for sedate purple, lest this inanimate Mother-hub comes alive and starts taking over my condo, the neighborhood, and eventually, the whole world.

Once everything is configured to your satisfaction on the web app, you can use the same login info to access the mobile version, which is available for Android, iOS, and Windows users.

Select ""Add an app"" from the Web app's Senseboard homepage to start tracking things; the Web app is where you'll want to go to make any major adjustments to Mother's setup. The mobile app is well designed, but it provides a limited snapshot, whereas the Web app offers the full breadth of customization options available to you.

And your options are pretty diverse -- I used each of the four Cookies to test Mother's many features and some sensors even performed more than one function simultaneously.

I attached two of the sensors to my doors (front and patio) to receive push notifications whenever they opened. I also used them to track the ambient temperate. I put another sensor in my pocket and it worked just like a pedometer, tracking my steps and telling me how many calories I was burning. I also set it up to act as a proximity sensor, so that Mother would disable the door-related motion alerts when it sensed that I was home. I shoved another sensor under my fitted sheet and it sent sleep data to the app and acted as my alarm in the morning, one that went ahead and woke me up when it noticed that I was stirring shortly before my official alarm time, similar to the  Hello Sense sleep system .

All of the most recent data collected will be displayed on the Senseboard and you can temporarily disable, delete and adjust any Cookie and any of its functions any time you want. When you click on one of the functions, you will get a more detailed look, so you can see a sleep graph and itemized sleep stats: I got 79 percent deep sleep, 7 percent light sleep, 6 percent intermediate sleep and 8 percent awake sleep on the night of September 25.

Most importantly, everything worked as expected. I received push notifications whenever the doors opened, got sleep cycle-related data and was able to monitor my steps and calories burned all from one central location. It's like a fitness band, a home-automation kit and a security system all in one, and the results are very intriguing. There's really nothing quite like Mother on the market today.

Still it does have some limitations. Cookies can only communicate with the hub up to roughly 65 feet. So, any time you take a one outside of that range, you won't receive the data until you return. I also found the fitness tracker setup slightly annoying. While you can switch between Metric and Imperial units, there was no place to enter height in feet and inches -- it only had a section for feet, so I had to enter that I was 5.6 feet tall instead of 5 feet and 7 inches. Close enough.

Sense's $300 Mother home automation and data-tracking kit is definitely unconventional, but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't make a good addition to your smart home. If you find that you're looking for a little organization in your life and like the idea of a Mother/hub/red-eyed overlord to keep you in check, Sense has a solid solution. Still, Mother is on the pricy side and you're out of luck if you want to track your steps on-the-go. Then again, it's highly adaptable and might just make some sense out of your hectic routine -- just like the overbearing mother you never had."
GE Link Connected LED review:|"

If you need evidence of the rapid evolution we've seen in both the lighting and smart home markets, look no further than the GE Link LED. With Zigbee-powered wireless smarts built right in, each bulb costs just $15. A year ago, that would have been a fair deal for one of its non-connected counterparts.

The Link LED is built to integrate into Wink's emerging smart home platform, which means it'll work with other Wink-approved gadgets -- a fairly wide lineup including the likes of  	Quirky,  Dropcam ,  Honeywell ,  Lutron , and even competing smart bulbs from  TCP  and  Philips Hue . Couple that with the low cost of the  Wink Hub  that controls it all, and you're looking at a pretty compelling foundation for the smart home.

That said, I'm not convinced that Wink is ready for primetime. Product after product, we've come away with the same complaint: glitchy software. Despite getting some things right, the Link LEDs were no exception, causing plenty of headaches during the testing process. There's still a lot to like about them, and at that price point, I think you can definitely afford to try one out. However, I also think I'd wait for Wink to polish the user experience a bit more before buying in too heavily.

GE's Link LED isn't designed to blend in with the bulbs that came before it. With its clear globe and exposed hardware, it makes no attempt to pass itself off as an ordinary light, which is the recent approach we've seen many LED competitors take. Even compared to other smart LEDs like the  	 Philips Hue Lux , the  Connected by TCP LED , and the  Belkin WeMo LED , the GE Link is the bulb that looks the most conspicuous.

Like those other smart options, the GE Link promises to last 25,000 hours, and offers around 800 lumens of light output at a warm, yellowy color temperature. GE gets there using 12 watts, which is slightly less efficient than the competition, but still a worthy upgrade over incandescents.

Something else the GE Link LED shares with its competitors is smart dimming capabilities, which simply means that you'll be able to dial the light up and down through the Wink app. However, the Link LED doesn't dim down quite as far as the others, which were able to get as low as 0.5 percent of initial brightness before shutting off. We couldn't get the Link LED down any lower than 10 percent, which was a bit disappointing. I also noticed more lag than the competition as I dimmed the light up and down.

In other basic spec tests, the Link LED did much better, most notably in our color rendering tests. In front of our spectrometer, the Link LED registered a very impressive score of 90 out of 100. A high score like that means that the GE Link LED will illuminate colors more accurately and vividly than much of the competition.

That score of 90 is better than any other smart LED we've tested, and just a few points shy of the LEDs that sit atop our color rendering leaderboard, the  	 Cree TW Series LED  and  the Editors' Choice-winning GE Reveal LED floodlight . Neither of those bulbs is smart, and the GE Link LED costs less than both of them.

The bottom line is that the GE Link's lighting specs are surprisingly good given how much you'll pay for it. If you took the smarts out, it would still be a fairly competitive 60W replacement LED.

Still, lighting specs are only half of the story here. The GE Link is built to compete with other connected LEDs, so you'll want to be sure and factor in the smart features and the usability of the app before making a buying decision.

To access those smart features, you'll need one of three hubs to act as translator between your phone's Wi-Fi and the bulb's Zigbee. Your first option is the Link Hub, a small $30 device that simply plugs into a spare socket, then talks to the bulbs and nothing else. Next up is the  Wink Hub , a $50 gadget with additional radios built in, allowing it to control more than just your lighting. Finally, there's the soon-to-be-released  Wink Relay , a futuristic, Android-powered touchscreen wall panel that'll sell for $300.

GE offers a Link LED starter kit with two bulbs and the Link Hub for a total of $50, which is half of what you'll spend on comparable two-bulb kits from Belkin and Philips. In addition, for a limited time, Home Depot is offering $30 off the price of the Wink Hub when you buy two Link LEDs, essentially giving you a starter kit with an upgraded hub at that same, accessible $50 price point.

Once you're up and running with your hub of choice, you'll connect your Link LEDs by screwing them in and turning them on when the Wink app tells you to. This sounds easy, but it took me multiple tries before the bulb registered. I tried again, this time with a different Wink Hub, and again, pairing things up was a bit of pain, and certainly more tedious than it should have been.

The Wink App offers simple controls for each bulb, with a button to turn the light on or off and a slider bar to dim the light up and down. You'll also be able to combine multiple bulbs into a group, allowing you to control all of them at once.

Beyond remote control of your lights, the Wink app offers automation, too. This starts with basic scheduling -- you can program the lights to turn on and off at various times of the day, and view your lighting schedule on a calendar. When I tested Wink's scheduling out, it never failed to turn the light on or off when it was supposed to.

Your other automation option is to use what Wink calls ""Robots,"" which are simply recipes that tie your lighting to an external trigger. The first one I tested was a proximity command. Wink monitors your phone's location, and can automatically turn the lights on and off as you come a go, a feature called ""geofencing.""

The Quirky Aros Smart Air Conditioner, another Wink product, offers geofencing, too, but we couldn't ever get it to work when we tested the thing out. Fortunately, the Link LEDs fared much better, successfully turning off whenever I'd leave the office, then turning on again right as I'd pull back into the parking lot.

Wink's Robots can also tie your lighting to other Wink-friendly products. I tested this out with the Quirky Spotter Multipurpose Sensor, telling Wink to turn the lights on whenever the Spotter detected motion, then back off when the motion stopped. I wasn't too impressed with the Spotter when I first reviewed it, but it did the job in this test, reliably turning the light on whenever I walked past it, then back off when I was gone. That made for two signs of improvement from Wink.

However, at this point, the Link LED began to glitch on us. Immediately after deleting those two motion sensing robots in the app, the light began alternating between full brightness and minimum brightness every thirty seconds or so, and stopped responding to my attempts to control it from the app. Even after unscrewing it and then screwing it back in, I couldn't control the thing.

My only option was to delete the Link LED from the system, then add it back in. That'd be especially frustrating if I had already programmed a good deal of robots, as I'd be forced to enter them all back into the app.

I wondered if maybe I was missing a firmware update somewhere, and sure enough, the Wink app was telling me that I needed to update the Hub. I told it to go ahead and do so, but then several minutes later, seemingly still in the middle of the update, the app reverted back to the beginning of the process, telling me an update was available. I wasn't sure if it had cancelled my update, or if there were simply more than one, so I started the process again. The same thing happened again. And then again. And then again on a different device.

None of this is to say that Wink is unusable, but it can definitely be frustrating -- certainly more so than Belkin, TCP, or Philips Hue. If you're willing to put up with that, though, the smart features are actually pretty sharp.

GE's Wink-ready Link LEDs have a lot going for them. At their core, they offer strong light quality, with a fairly exceptional color rendering score. Add in the smart scheduling, geofencing, and compatibility with other Wink products, and you've got a $15 bulb that looks like a potential best buy.

Still, you aren't just buying the bulb -- you're buying into Wink's smart home platform. Though appealing and affordable, it's a wobblier platform than others, with glitches and app crashes that compromise an otherwise appealing user experience. I like these bulbs, but if you wanted to wait for Wink to work its kinks out before buying them, I wouldn't blame you."
Haven's Smart Lock ditches the deadbolt|"

A barrage of locks have entered the smart home scene lately, including  August ,  Goji ,  Kwikset's Kevo , and  Lockitron . While each brand made different design choices, they all follow one key DIY principle -- that you should be able to attach your new smart lock to your existing deadbolt.

This install-light approach is an appealing option for a lot of folks, but startup Haven wasn't impressed. It claims that these retrofit smart locks offer convenience, but not security.

We definitely saw  weakness with the Kwikset Kevo, which one of our technical editors, Steve, disabled in less than 5 minutes and Chris Lind, a professional locksmith from Bob Cook Locksmiths, circumvented in just 30 seconds.

Some dismiss the limitations of deadbolts, claiming that no lock can deter a determined burglar in the end. Haven seems to have found fault with this argument, though, citing ""weak"" locks as the reason for the majority of successful forced entries. So, it decided to create a new standard for the vulnerable entry-points in your home: The Haven Smart Lock, a device that actually avoids the lock altogether.

Haven's Smart Lock is a steel, glass, reinforced nylon and aluminum strip that you install at the base of your door inside your house. It's supposed to act like a doorjamb that wedges up against the door when engaged and releases when unlocked. You can manually release the lock from inside if you don't have a connected gadget handy, but otherwise, this Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-enabled gizmo is designed to work with Android and iOS devices and well as wearables.

That way, you can come and go as you please without the bother of keys and you can extend access to friends and family, too. This battery-powered Smart Lock is equipped with relays so it will continue to operate if you lose power or if your internet connection goes kaput. Haven also claims to have Nest Developer Program and Apple iOS 8 HomeKit integration in the works.

Haven's Kickstarter campaign launched a couple of days ago, and it's already a third of the way toward its $150,000 funding goal (which converts to roughly £90,000 or AU$170,000). Smart Lock prices for early backers start at $200 (roughly £125 and AU$225) and units are supposed to ship August 2015."
Orbnext review:|"

""Your world at a glance"" -- that's what Colorado-based Advanced Lumonics is offering with Orbnext, a Wi-Fi enabled, color-changing desktop novelty. With 10 multicolor Cree LEDs housed within frosted glass and its own channel on IFTTT, Orbnext can change colors to notify you of things like important emails, new followers on Twitter or anything else you can think up.

The rub, of course, is that Orbnext costs a hefty $129. In Australia, that comes out to around AU$185 once you factor in international shipping -- in the UK, you'll need to drop a cool £100. That certainly isn't inexpensive, especially when you consider color-changing LED competitors like  Philips Hue ,  Tabu Lumen  and  Lifx  that each cost a lot less per light. Cool factor aside, Orbnext is still very much a novelty item, and unless it has you dazzled, I think you can safely resist the urge to splurge.

As I'm sure you've noticed by this point, the cube-shaped Orbnext isn't an orb at all. The name is a callback to the  Ambient Orb , a color-changing sphere from 2004 that offered basic ambient notifications before notifications were really a thing. The Ambient Orb was attractive and futuristic -- perhaps to a fault. As CNET's Brian Cooley said at the time, ""All we know is that we like this thing.""

Advanced Lumonics is likely hoping that in today's smartphone-centric age -- and with IFTTT doing the heavy lifting -- a color-coded, design-oriented, ambient light notification gadget makes a little more sense. To an extent, I think that it does. As a geeky sort of splurge, I can see the appeal.

That appeal cuts two ways. First, there's the surprising practicality of the thing. With Orbnext and IFTTT, you'll be able to program color changes for whatever you deem important. Maybe you want it turn bright red if the boss emails you, or green whenever your fitness tracker detects that you've hit a daily goal. For a subtle, unobtrusive notification mechanism that lets you keep your phone in your pocket for once, you could really do a lot worse.

The other angle comes down to design: Orbnext is pretty to look at. With frosted glass and colorful minimalism, it's an attractive little desktop decoration capable of casting a futuristic sheen over just about any workstation.

Still, the minimalist design isn't perfect. While the frosted glass certainly gives Orbnext the feel of a high-end gadget, it also looks a little bit like plastic. One or two additional design flourishes might have helped to reinforce the high-end aesthetic.

For basic control over Orbnext, you'll use the ""blink.n.play"" app from Advanced Lumonics. That name comes from the pairing process -- to connect your Orbnext, you'll hold it over your phone while the app blinks a rapid light pattern coded with your Wi-Fi info. That's the same trick that Quirky uses to connect products like the  Porkfolio , the  Pivot Power Genius , and the  Aros Smart Air Conditioner , which isn't too surprising, given that those products use the same ElectricIMP motherboard as Orbnext.

The blink.n.play app definitely errs on the sparse side, with very basic, limited controls for Orbnext. You can set Orbnext to change color as the stock market rises and falls, or as the temperature changes. There's also a Lamp mode where you can quickly choose from one of 12 colored presets, along with a full color palette for more in-depth color selection.

I'm glad Advanced Lumonics included both the Lamp and Palette modes, but can't say that I was terribly impressed with the latter of the two. Orbnext won't change colors as you drag your fingertip around the spectrum -- you'll need to stop and tap a separate button to actually see a change. That makes shade selection a tedious trial-and-error process. It's a small complaint, but for such a pricey little device, I wish the app felt more refined.

I also wish that the app offered more unique features. Other color-changing LED products include fun things like music syncing, multiple color cycle presets, or even the ability to create your own color cycles. Orbnext doesn't. The only cycle you get is a single arbitrary setting that fades through the same six or seven colors over and over.

The app also lacks any kind of scheduling mechanism, a basic feature that any smart lighting product should really include. Instead, Orbnext outsourced the scheduling to IFTTT. This isn't a terrible thing by any stretch -- it's easy enough to craft an IFTTT recipe that changes the color at a certain time each day. Still, IFTTT's servers tend to lag every now and then, with recipes sometimes taking an extra couple of minutes to fire. You wouldn't have that issue if scheduling was localized in the Orbnext app.

For more advanced automation controls, IFTTT offers plenty of room for creativity. As of writing this, IFTTT offers 131 different channels, 105 of which can be used to trigger an Orbnext color change. Along with the obvious smattering of social networks, you'll find useful Web tools and popular smart-home gadgets, too. If you've already bought into those sorts of gadgets and services, then Orbnext's IFTTT-powered smarts will carry some extra appeal.

In my tests, I played around with a variety of triggers, and aside from the occasional delay, found them to work more or less reliably. With IFTTT, I was able to trigger color changes by stepping in front of a  Belkin WeMo motion detector , favoriting a co-worker's tweet, cutting an under-performing wide receiver from my fantasy football team, parking my car at the office, and placing coins into the  Quirky Porkfolio  smart piggy bank.

Obviously, some triggers are far more practical than others, but the point is that the Orbnext IFTTT channel works, and works well enough that you can rely on it for all but the most urgent notification needs.

Orbnext is a clear smart home novelty, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. If it appeals to your tastes, I wouldn't fault you for wanting one -- but I'd advise you to consider the alternatives before spending the $129.

Color-changing smart bulbs like  Lifx  and  Tabu's Lumen LED  cost a lot less, and offer much of the same niche appeal, along with a level of general household lighting functionality that you won't get with Orbnext. If IFTTT is what's important to you, the $199 three-bulb  Philips Hue Starter Pack  might also be a worthier investment. For most with an interest in this sort of thing -- though certainly not all -- I have to think that one of those would be a better choice."
Belkin WeMo LED Lighting Starter Set review:|"

That price cut likely stems from new rivals that have emerged during Belkin's delay -- most notably the similarly priced white-light  Hue Lux LEDs from Philips . In that same period, we've also seen the less expensive, US-only  Connected by TCP LEDs  integrate with  SmartThings  and  Wink , upping their appeal even further. With competition like that, Belkin might have missed its chance to get out in front of the pack.

Still, there's a lot to like about these lights, especially if you've already bought into the WeMo family of  switches  and  smart devices . Like the Hue Lux LEDs, the WeMo bulbs are IFTTT-compatible and boast a full suite of well-designed, easy-to-use app controls. Smarts aside, they're highly efficient and stronger than Philips or TCP when it comes to color rendering. With those sorts of specs, Belkin's smart bulbs are certainly better late than never.

Belkin didn't go out of its way to make its LEDs stand out from the crowd. With a traditional A19 shape and a white-bodied base, they follow a trend we've seen other LEDs tack recently, with space-age looks eschewed in favor of less-conspicuous builds.

The starter kit will set you up with two bulbs and the WeMo Link that you'll need in order to control them. While the LEDs aren't available in the UK yet, other WeMo products are. That $100 price point for the starter set converts roughly to a little over £60.

In Australia it's a little more expensive -- AU$169.95 for the two bulb starter kit or AU$49.95 for each individual bulb.

The WeMo Link is a small plug-in device that's just slightly larger than a typical phone charger. The plug will receive data over Wi-Fi (such as you turning the lights on from the WeMo app), then relay it to the bulbs via ZigBee, the same standard used by Philips Hue and Hue Lux LEDs.

Those Philips bulbs, however, require you to plug a hub directly into your router. That can lead to clutter on the router shelf and fierce competition for those Ethernet jacks, something we've certainly experienced here at CNET Appliances HQ. I much prefer Belkin's approach, which lets you plug the Link in wherever you like.

Like we've found with other WeMo products, getting started is relatively simple. After plugging the Link in, it'll flash green and orange. Pull out your smartphone and you'll be able to join up with the Link's Wi-Fi network. Once you do, screw in the bulbs, turn them on, and open the WeMo app. It'll detect your bulbs automatically then pop you back onto your home Wi-Fi network, and you'll be ready to go.

If you're already using WeMo products like the  WeMo Light Switch  or the  WeMo Switch + Motion , you'll be able to control your bulbs right alongside them in the WeMo app. This includes rule creation, which means you'll be able to do things like turn your lights on by triggering WeMo's motion detector.

Back to the bulbs, though. At a power draw of 9.5 watts, and with a light output of 800 lumens, they're slightly more efficient than the competition. Belkin also settled on a color temperature of 3,000 K, just slightly hotter and less yellowy than the 2,700 K light put out by Philips and TCP.

The bulbs are also fully dimmable through the WeMo app -- though you'll want to be sure not to use them with in-wall dimmer-switch setups, as the two dimming mechanisms will clash, causing terrible flickering. In the app, though, dimming is smooth, simple, and flicker-free, with a slider bar that lets you dial the light up from 0 to 100 percent in 1 percent increments.

In front of our spectrometer, we detected increasing levels of light at each and every percentage point. That's an especially nice level of dimming control if you're picky about the brightness of your bulbs. My only complaint: that minimum, 1 percent level of brightness puts out about 4 percent of the bulb's total light output. That's probably plenty low for most purposes, but both Philips and TCP can dial down even lower.

One of the WeMo LED's strongest specs is its color-rendering score, which averages out to 88 out of 100. Most 60W replacement LEDs will struggle with red tones, and sit at an average score right around 80, which is where you'll find both the Philips Hue Lux LED and the Connected by TCP LED.

At 88, the WeMo LED can claim to make the colors in your home look noticeably more vivid and accurate than those two will -- though it won't do quite as good a job as bulbs that score in the nineties, like the  Cree TW Series LED  or the Editors' Choice-winning  GE Reveal LED floodlight .

Light-bulb nerdery aside, what you're paying for with WeMo LEDs are the smarts. As automatable LEDs go, they're a good option, with plenty of subtle features packed into the WeMo app.

These include the expected remote controls and scheduling capabilities. If you want your lights to turn on at 8:00 AM each morning -- or at sunrise -- the WeMo app makes it easy. Additionally, you can program fades into your lighting schedules, letting you set the lights to gradually fade on over a minute, an hour, or anything in between. You can also tell the lights to slowly fade down by pressing the ""Go to sleep"" button.

In my home, I use Connected by TCP bulbs to wake up in the morning, but the app doesn't offer an easy mechanism for slow, customized fades, or a quick sleep mode. Of the two, WeMo looks like the more feature-rich smart lighting setup.

Something else that WeMo has over TCP is an IFTTT channel, as Philips does for its Hue Lux LEDs. With IFTTT's simple ""if this, then that"" approach to automation, you'll be able to plug your WeMo LEDs in as the ""then that,"" then choose the ""if this"" from a lengthy list of Web services and smart home devices. That means you'll be able to trigger your lighting using things like iOS location, Jawbone UP24, and even Facebook posts and Foursquare check-ins, if you're so inclined.

Belkin's team tells us that the WeMo LED's IFTTT channel won't be ready immediately at the product's launch, though they're hoping to go live as soon as possible. Once it's up and running, I'll test it out and update this review accordingly -- watch this space.

As mentioned before, the WeMo app makes a cinch out of setup. Like with most recent smart home apps, you'll find a handy series of start-up screens to walk you through the process. Within a few minutes, you should be up and running.

I enjoyed using the WeMo app as I tested the kit out. Belkin has been refining the WeMo ecosystem for about a year now, and it shows -- the app feels polished and well thought-out. Features are easy to find and easy to use, with a simple rule creation interface and the ability to see the status of all of your devices at a quick glance. My scheduled lighting changes always went off without a hitch, and remote controls were quick and responsive, even when I tried controlling the lights from beyond the home Wi-Fi network.

All that said, those app controls are all that you get. There's no physical WeMo remote to compete with TCP's low-cost remote or the pricier  Philips Hue Tap , and Belkin doesn't offer a Web interface for controlling your lights and devices, either. With Philips Hue LEDs, you'll find plenty of third-party Web control interfaces, thanks to an open API. TCP offers a Web interface too, though you have to be on your home network in order to use it.

The WeMo LEDs look well-positioned to enjoy the same third-party integrations as previous WeMo devices. Aside from IFTTT, the list includes compatibility with platforms like SmartThings and Revolv, though not Wink or Staples Connect. The well-established Philips Hue brand covers all of these bases and more, while TCP bulbs are only compatible with Wink and SmartThings.

No matter which smart LED you go with, you're going to have plenty of third-party options to sync up with, but if you've got a specific third-party platform or device in mind, you'll definitely want to make sure and check for compatibility.

Overall, all three look like viable smart home options to me. If IFTTT interests you, then both WeMo and Philips Hue Lux will get you there for the same price. With WeMo, you've got direct compatibility with WeMo Switches and motion sensors -- with Philips Hue Lux, it's the potential to splurge and add a few of the original, color-changing Hue LEDs to your setup. If one of those sounds more appealing to you, I say let it tip the scale in your buying decision.

Adding smart bulbs into the WeMo ecosystem seems like a bit of a no-brainer to me, so I'm glad that WeMo LEDs are finally here. As smart bulbs go, they're a very solid, very functional option. Existing WeMo users will be especially happy should they choose to upgrade their Belkin-powered smart home with new, matching LEDs.

Still, as fast as both the smart home and LED markets are moving, I'll bet Belkin wishes it had gotten here a bit sooner. Competition is ramping up on both fronts, and costs are coming down. With  Philips Hue Lux  already established,  Connected by TCP  bulbs getting smarter, and new, ultra-affordable  GE Link LEDs  just arriving to market, competing now is going to be a whole lot tougher than it would have been five or six months ago."
Oplink Connected Video C2 review:|"

Oplink's $300 Connected Video C2 kit comes with two Wi-Fi-enabled cameras, a 16GB flash drive, and the Oplink Processing Unit (OPU), which is just Oplink's fancy term for its router-connected hub. Considering that DIY cameras like the  Samsung SmartCam HD Pro  and the  Dropcam Pro  sell for roughly $200 a pop, this security system seemed like a pretty good value...at first.

I like that you can use the flash drive for local storage, but you'll still have to bring cloud-based data transfer into the mix if you want to view any saved clips on your phone -- and it will set you back $20 per month. Yes, this service is optional, but many brands offer cloud storage and remote access to video clips for much less. Icontrol's $200  Piper security system  lets you save and review up to 1,000 clips at no extra charge, and  Arcsoft's $150 Simplicam  fees start at just $5 per month.





Oplink's 640x480 resolution is also a bit of a letdown, since other budget cameras, like  Belkin's $130 NetCam HD+ , boast at least 1,280x720. And, while the brand offers various accessories you can add to the Connected Video system, there's still no word on an IFTTT channel or compatibility with third-party devices.

Steer clear of this system if you want to review clips on your phone; otherwise, it's a decent bargain kit for local-storage-only folks looking to buy more than one camera.

The Oplink hub and corresponding Wi-Fi cameras are finished in glossy white plastic -- a popular, if not slightly boring choice for today's connected cameras. The free Oplink Connected app is available on Android, iOS, and Windows devices; it will walk you through setting up your OPU hub, cameras, and other related Oplink accessories.

Installation was fairly simple -- plug the flash drive into the OPU, use the included Ethernet cable to connect the OPU to the router, plug in the power adapter, and make sure DHCP is enabled on your router (most default to this setting, but if yours doesn't you'll have to follow along with the user's guide to get things going).

Now, you're ready to set up the cameras. The instructions tell you to plug them in within 5 feet of the location of the router. This is a bit of a pain, but they're just trying to secure a Wi-Fi connection and you can move them again after the initial setup. When the bottom LED indicator blinks green, you know you're in business -- now you can unplug the cameras and relocate them as needed.

Oplink also sent me a bunch of devices to test its home automation and security add-ons. The accessories included a siren, a door/window sensor, a key fob, a water leak detector, a motion sensor, and a smart plug. This setup was a bit more complicated, as the app asked me to scan the QR code on the device to pair it, but that only worked on one of the devices.

The backup plan involved typing in a long, custom alphanumeric code that was printed in a very tiny font on each accessory. My less-than-perfect eyesight definitely struggled on this step each time, but, I managed to get everything up and running in about 30 minutes.

Since the two cameras are at the core of this Connected Video system, here's a chart comparing Oplink's cameras to other DIY options:

Not so good. Yes, you're getting two cameras for $300, but they have 640x480-pixel resolutions, no sound alerts, no two-way audio, and 66-degree fields of view. The local storage flash drive will be a definite plus for some, but, when you realize that you have to shell out $20 per month (a whopping $240 per year) to see your video clips on your phone, Oplink's Connected Video kit quickly loses appeal.

Features aside, I'm also curious about the true value of this kit. Amazon is currently selling Oplink's Wi-Fi cameras for $80 each, so that covers roughly $160 of the $300 kit -- does that mean that the compulsory OPU hub and 16GB flash drive cover the remaining $140?

That sure seems strange, especially when you consider that the $370  Oplink TripleShield security system  comes with the same hub, the same two Wi-Fi cameras, and a bunch of those optional accessories that aren't included in this $300 kit. Hm.

If you don't want to view clips on the app, you can still stream live footage and access snapshots (rather than video) when a security event is triggered, but anyone interested in accessing clips remotely won't enjoy any added convenience from Oplink's local storage solution.

Samsung's $190 SmartCam HD Pro might cost more up front, but it offers better video quality, a larger field of view (nearly double the Oplink cameras), and added features like two-way talk. And, it relies on microSD cards (up to 64GB) rather than flash drives.

Despite Oplink's disappointing specs, the cameras and added accessories performed well. I was able to view live video in the app's video section, turn the Oplink smart plug-connected lamp on and off in the app's automation section; set the system to arm, disarm, or away in the app's mode section; and review saved clips in the app's VideoGram section.

Whenever the motion sensor-equipped cameras or separate motion and door/window sensors accessories detected activity, the cameras recorded 30-second clips and stored them for later review. You can also opt in or out of push notifications and email alerts, and you can adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensors as needed. I set the cameras to the highest possible sensitivity and received alerts around the clock.

In addition to being able to watch clips on your phone, the $20 monthly fee lets you extend app access to other people and let emergency contacts receive alerts whenever a potential security breach takes place.

While the video quality was lower than some of the other cameras I've tested, its 480p resolution wasn't particularly bad. I didn't experience any major lag times or notice any significant blotchiness or other video streaming unpleasantness. I did find the auto-night vision feature odd, though.

Most systems let you set your mode preference to automatic or manual. This one doesn't have a manual setting and defaulted to night vision at irregular times, even when all of the lights were on in the office. Still, the picture was decent in both day and night mode, and the wonky night vision didn't significantly impact overall performance.

Given that the Oplink Connected Video system doesn't have competitive camera specs, costs $20 per month for a mobile access to video clips, and presents a worse value than the brand's own $370  TripleShield  system, it's pretty hard to recommend this kit. If you don't plan to review clips on your phone and want a budget, multi-camera system, it will get the job done. Still, I'd spring for Samsung's $190 SmartCam HD Pro if you can. Its video quality, features, and SD card storage trump Oplink's Connected Video kit at every turn."
D-Link dishes out a new budget Wi-Fi Smart Plug|"

We weren't particularly impressed with the $50  D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug  (model number DSP-W215) that we reviewed earlier this year. Its setup was complicated and I had to reinstall the app every time it was unplugged. It also didn't have an accompanying IFTTT channel or a particularly intuitive app -- two major no-no's in the smart home sector.

But now D-Link is back with a new $40 Wi-Fi Smart Plug (model number DSP-W110) that might just be an improvement over its clunky predecessor.

If the pricier DSP-W215, which keeps track of power consumption and has a sensor that shuts off overheating appliances, is in direct competition with  Belkin's $60 WeMo Insight Switch , D-Link's new $40 plug is closer to the $50  Belkin WeMo Switch  in terms of features.

So, while you won't be able to check your energy usage with this plug, you will still be able to turn your gadgets on and off remotely and set recurring schedules on the related app. D-Link's new plug has also undergone a clear design overhaul -- a definite upgrade over the more utilitarian-looking DSP-W215.

Since D-Link's new Wi-Fi Smart Plug works on the same Mydlink app, and IFTTT isn't mentioned in the official press release, it doesn't seem that this new plug is a huge departure from its previous iteration. Still, it should round out the brand's smart plug offerings and make it more competitive with Belkin and Wi-Fi plug startups such as  SensePlug.io .

The $40 D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug is available today on the D-Link site and on Amazon. We've asked D-Link to send us their new plug, so expect to hear more details on the DSP-W110 soon."
Fibaro smart home eyes US market with distinctive sci-fi looks|"

Make way for another smart home kit. This time it's a solution from Fibaro that has its eye on the burgeoning connected-home market. Complete with sensors for motion, lighting, temperature, even water, the Fibaro system not only looks distinctive, it promises quite a bit of sophistication for your household as well.

To be clear, the folks behind the Fibaro connected home products, Poland-based Fibar group, didn't offer a lot of specifics outside of glossy brochures and an equally vague website. Even so, that didn't stop Fibaro representatives from extolling the smart-home virtues of its creation at the CEDIA 2014 tradeshow in Denver, Colo. While availability outside of the US might happen by the end of 2014, pricing for Fibaro in other markets wasn't outlined.

The most striking attribute of Fibaro is an ocular-shaped motion sensor for $60 (converts to about £40, or AU$67) which has a distinctly feline, almost alien look to it. In fact, the thing could almost be a stand-in for the Eye of Sauron from ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. And this gadget does promise to see a great deal. According to Fibaro the device packs sensors to detect light, temperature, plus has an accelerometer for good measure. Users, say Fibaro, can also configure the motion sensor's eye to glow in different colors depending on changes in environment it notices.

Other parts of Fibaro puzzle include a wall plug  to hook up lamps and similar electrical appliances. Also nice are the adapter's USB charger and power-monitoring function to get a handle on what attached appliances are really costing in terms of your utility bill. A fire and smoke detector add-on, plus a flood sensor (all set to cost $60; converted about £40 or AU$67) are also planned, along with door and window sensors (both to be priced at $50; converted about £30 or AU$55) targeted at the security-minded.

At the heart of Fibaro is a $750 Home Center 2 hub (converts to about £460 or AU$830) which leans on the Z-Wave protocol to speak to Fibaro's numerous wireless parts. This is a steep price to be sure, but Fibaro says the device is robust enough to command every smart product in your home, including lights, blinds, cameras, thermostats, and HVAC equipment. If this is too rich for your blood, Fibaro also plans to sell a Home Center Lite hub for $280 (about £300 or AU$530 converted), though it's not clear how its functionality differs from its more expensive sibling other than it handles ""multimedia systems.""

Other details remain murky for the moment, but check back for pricing and release information as it becomes available."
Mipow's Playbulb Candle corners the market on LED ambiance|"

Mipow is known for its Bluetooth-enabled mobile accessories, but it has recently made a foray into the wild world of LED lighting. Merging its two areas of focus, it initially unveiled Playbulb, an LED bulb-and-speaker-in-one. Now, it's in the midst of a Kickstarter campaign for a new lighting product, the Playbulb Candle.

The Playbulb Candle can't play music like its speaker-equipped cousin, but it does have color-changing and white-light LEDs that emit a max of 4 lumens -- roughly comparable to soft candlelight. Mipow's complimentary Android and iOS apps let you tweak your Playbulb Candle's color, brightness, and more when you're within its 33-foot Bluetooth range.

The app works with Bluetooth-4.0-equipped devices, including  Android 4.3 or later, iPhone 4S or later, iPad 3 or later, and iPod fifth generation or later. The Candle runs on three AA batteries and Mipow says setup is as simple as adding the AAs, turning the Candle on, downloading the Playbulb X app on your device of choice, and following the instructions to get things going.

You can adjust your Playbulb Candles individually or in groups. While you can technically group an unlimited number of Candles, Mipow suggests an upper limit of five for optimal performance. Every Candle is supposed to last for about 240 hours (running for 4 hours a day for 60 days) before needing new batteries and you can set a timer on the app to automate its on/off functions.

If you do want to turn it on or off in person, you can either use the built-in switch or blow on it. Yep, Mipow wanted its Candles to be as close to the real thing as possible. So, it added some sort of fancy sensor magic that lets you blow on it like a regular ol' candle to turn it off, but also, interestingly, to turn it back on again. I've reached out to Mipow for more details on this curious feature.

Playbulb Candles are rated for indoor and outdoor use, give off a lavender scent, and, when flipped over, can be used as actual candle holders.

We haven't seen anything else quite like the Playbulb Candle.  Tabu's color-changing LuMini  comes somewhat close, but it doesn't have white-light properties and is a traditional bulb rather than a separate, battery-powered device. Still, both definitely tend toward the more fun, novel side of LED lighting.

Playbulb Candle pledge prices start at just $12 (roughly £7.40 and AU$13.15) a pop and go up to $99 (roughly £61 and AU$108.60) or more for a pack of nine. Though the original goal of $5,000 has already been exceeded, the campaign runs until October 2, and Mipow expects to start shipping its colorful nightlight/accent lights to backers in October."
Quirky Porkfolio review:|"

""The Internet of Things"" is an admittedly broad term, so I suppose we shouldn't be too surprised to see a connected piggy bank. That's exactly the ""Thing"" that Quirky's offering with the Porkfolio: a smart, Wi-Fi-enabled coin collector capable of tracking your savings on your phone. It even has its own channel on IFTTT.

If you just rolled your eyes or breathed a heavy sigh, I hear you. The $50 Porkfolio certainly seems less like a smart home necessity than a solution in search of a problem. And yet, unlike the equally unnecessary  Quirky Egg Minder , the Porkfolio takes its frivolity in stride. There's just enough charm and basic usefulness packed into this pig to keep you more or less happy with it -- and it carries some unique, kid-friendly appeal, too. If you're looking for a lighthearted smart-home novelty for your 7-year-old nephew (or perhaps your inner 7-year-old), I think you could honestly do a whole lot worse than this.

If the Porkfolio's cute design doesn't immediately win you over, give it some time. The blunt-nosed guy has been sitting on my desk at work for about a week now, staring at me with dimpled eyes even as I type this sentence, and I have to admit: I've grown a little fond of the thing. I know, I know. A year spent critiquing repetitive stainless steel designs and boring, white-plastic-bodied gadgets has made me particularly susceptible to a little pink porker with a few ounces' worth of personality.

If pink isn't to your tastes, the Porkfolio also comes in white or black. All three versions are made from thick, rubbery plastic, making it feel very much like a toy. As a smart-home gadget geared towards kids, that's a design choice that makes plenty of sense. To this end, you can even rotate the head and the limbs, which switches the pig between lying on its back and sprawling out on its belly.

To get started with the Porkfolio, you'll need to download the free Wink app to your Android or iOS device, then follow the onscreen instructions. If you don't have a  Wink Hub , don't worry -- you don't need one in order to use the Porkfolio.

You'll pull a tab inside the Porkfolio's belly to activate a built-in battery. The pig's nose will begin to flash (it also lights up for every coin you deposit). When prompted in the app, you'll touch the nose to your phone's screen. The screen will flash a code at the Porkfolio, telling it your Wi-Fi information, and voila, you'll have  connected your piggy bank to the cloud.

That's the same connection trick that Quirky uses for other Wink-powered products, including the  Quirky Aros , the  Quirky Pivot Power Genius , and the  Quirky Spotter . For the most part, it's a pretty easy way of getting things synced up, although on occasion, I've needed to flash my phone at my device more than once to get it to work.

From there, this smart piggy bank works more or less like any other piggy bank -- you put coins in the slot, and it hangs onto them until you're ready to take them out and dash off to the nearest bank or Coinstar machine. The difference, of course, is that you'll be able to track just how much coin you've collected in the Wink app.

As we've noted in earlier reviews, Wink has one of the better-looking smart home apps we've come across. The design is fun, playful, and befitting a product like the Porkfolio. Front and center is the piggy's face (he'll wiggle his nose a bit and blink at you, which is a nice little touch). Tap his nose, and you'll be able to change the colors that shine whenever you deposit a coin.

Above the image of the pig's face, you'll see how your stash totals up. Below, you'll be able to set a savings goal and graph your progress. You'll also be able to tell the Porkfolio how much you're taking out whenever you make a withdrawal, which you'll need to do if you want to keep the total accurate.

The Porkfolio tracks your savings using a clever, spring-loaded mechanism in the top slot. Push a coin through, and it'll push the spring out of the way. This lets the Porkfolio know how big the coin is, which is how it figures out what sort of coin you're putting in.

For the most part, this works perfectly well. In my tests, there was never more than a second or so between putting a coin in and seeing the total go up in the app. Still, it isn't foolproof. Put a coin in at an angle, or push it a few extra millimeters against the spring by mistake, and you might fool the Porkfolio into thinking it's bigger than it actually is. I was repeatedly able to trick it into thinking a penny was a nickel, for instance, although I needed to make a conscious effort to do so.

Another problem with this design is that the Porkfolio can only handle one coin at a time. Slide two coins in side-by-side, and the spring mechanism will only read it as a single coin. This gets tedious if you're transferring an entire jar's worth of quarters into the thing, but for the most part, it's a small quibble.

To get to your loot, you'll remove a plug on the bottom of the bank. Inside, there's an annoyingly inclined ridge around the rim of the opening that keeps the coins from falling out naturally, so you'll need to do a fair deal of shaking to get them out, and probably fish around with your finger for those last few pennies.

Aside from tracking how much money you're putting into it, the Porkfolio will alert you when it's running low on batteries. You can also set it to alert you if someone moves the bank, or if it gets flipped upside down. I couldn't get the movement alerts to work at all, but the upside down alerts came through like clockwork each and every time.

Upside-down alerts might sound like a rather pointless feature, but I could see it coming in handy as a sneaky way for parents to know if their kid is jumping the gun on their nest egg, or perhaps as a means for the kid in question to catch a thieving sibling red-handed.

I also enjoyed the way the nose lit up whenever I put a coin in, and appreciated that I could customize the color of the light in the app. You can't program the lights in any other way, though, and that seems like a wasted opportunity. For instance, why not have the lights change to green after surpassing a savings goal? To red when the battery is low?

Another strange omission is that the Wink app won't notify you when you've hit your savings goal. An automatic congratulatory alert seems like a no-brainer, but you won't get anything of the sort. Instead, you're forced to turn to the Porkfolio's IFTTT channel, and while it's easy to enough to program an IFTTT alert on your phone or elsewhere whenever your balance rises above a certain point, this still feels like a feature that belongs in the Wink app itself.

Speaking of that IFTTT channel, it's a little bit sparse, which isn't surprising considering that we're talking about a piggy bank. You'll have access to two ""If This"" triggers: ""money added"" and ""balance rises above."" Both of these are just what they sound like -- the first triggers your action of choice whenever you deposit a coin, the second triggers an action once you've cleared a certain balance.

The balance trigger makes sense for the aforementioned time-to-raid-the-piggy-bank-and-go-buy-a-video-game alert, but the money added trigger seems less useful. I suppose you could set up a recipe to let you know how high your balance has risen whenever you deposit coins, but the constant stream of updates seems like it would get old fast -- and besides, isn't that what the app is for?

Frivolity is forgivable if the product in question doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's probably the most important thing the Porkfolio gets right. It isn't trying to be a smart-home game changer. It's just a place to put your coins that's slightly more functional -- and slightly more fun -- than that old mason jar you keep on top of your dresser.

Absolutely no one needs a Porkfolio -- but I couldn't blame you for being charmed into wanting one. At $50 (or less if you can catch it on sale, which doesn't seem particularly difficult to do), it isn't a purchase that'll sting too badly at checkout. Most importantly, it's just fun enough to warrant regular use, which might make it a good way to teach an app-savvy kid about budgeting and saving -- or a good way to keep you collecting loose change until you can afford to splurge on some other silly gadget."
Philips brings smart LEDs to new Hue Beyond light fixtures|"

Where Philips'  Hue Connected Bulbs  gave you individual LEDs to add to any traditional socket, the company's new Hue Beyond series, announced today, integrate the Dutch company's smart LED tech directly into a set of hard-wired, expensive light fixtures.

Starting at £299 for a table lamp with no connectivity hub (for those who already own one), and going all the way up to £529 for either a pendant or ceiling fixture kit, these lamps are for the well-off smart home enthusiast. US and Australia prices have yet to be announced, but those prices convert to $495-$875 and AU$530-AU$940.

They also make gimmicky colored LEDs seem a little less obtrusive. Unlike the Hue Connected Bulbs, the Hue Beyond lamps all have the LEDs built directly into them. There's no bulb to change, and once you experience dimming (only likely after 15,000 hours/15 years of use, says Philips) or a wonky diode, you have to live with it. Yes, Hue Beyond lamps bring with them some risk. You also have to like the design.

The technical appeal of the Beyond line is that each fixture includes two banks of LEDs, one in the top shade, and one in the bottom, and you can control them independently via Philips Hue iOS and Android apps.

Each bank offers the same degree of programmability as the standard Hue Connected bulbs, and the Beyond series is also compatible with the existing Hue network. That means that alongside any Hue bulbs you already have, you can program each set of Hue Beyond  LEDs to display one of over 16 million RGB colors, as well as the full spectrum of orange-to-blue white typical of traditional incandescent bulbs. You can also tell them to perform certain automated behaviors.

Imagine using the bottom-most LEDs as a reading light, and programming the top portion to flash red  when you have a new email, or when a loved one arrives at a certain location. Because the Hue Beyond works with the  IFTTT  service as well as various smart home hubs like  Revolv  and  SmartThings , you can tie the lamps' behavior to an ever-growing network of smart home devices and online services.

Given the smartphone-centric control schemes common to many connected home devices, it's refreshing for a product to introduce features, in this case color-coded notifications, that can help us untether ourselves from our various mobile products.

Philips promises the same color rendering quality, 600-lumen output (1,200 lumens for the pendant and ceiling light), and longevity for the Hue Beyond fixtures as for the standalone Hue LEDs. They hit the UK's Selfridges department stores this month, with retail availability coming to the US and the rest of the world at some unspecified future date. We hope to have some hands-on time shortly here at IFA, and we'll update accordingly."
Cree BR30 LED review: (y3gyc)|"

North Carolina-based industrial lighting manufacturer Cree has only been selling residential LED light bulbs for a year and a half, but that hasn't stopped it from establishing itself as a brand to be reckoned with. The  	 40W and 60W replacement LEDs  that served as the company's debut bulbs quickly became bestsellers in the lighting aisle, thanks to aggressive pricing and a generous 10-year warranty.

Cree took a similar approach with the next bulb they released, a BR30 floodlight LED. At a time when LEDs were still essentially priced as luxuries, the Cree BR30 came in right under $20 -- still far pricier than incandescents, halogens, and CFLs, but reasonable enough to spur sales all the same.

Now, over a year later, the lighting landscape has changed, with new competitors filling the shelves and prices falling to their most affordable levels yet. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is Cree's BR30 -- and neither has its $20 price tag. With intriguing LED alternatives like the  	 Philips SlimStyle BR30  and even superior ones like the  GE Reveal BR30  available for less, Cree might be behind the market here, an unusual position for the LED upstart. Until they catch up, buying the company's flagship floodlight just doesn't make much sense.

Aside from its shape, the Cree BR30 LED doesn't differ much from the design of the original Cree LEDs. Take a cursory look at the bulb, and you'll find the same white body with the Cree logo, those same, fin-like heat sinks around the bulb's collar, and the same rubbery coating over the glass.

Designed to replace 65W incandescent floodlights of the same shape, the Cree BR30 LED puts out 650 lumens worth of light, with anything over 600 lumens being sufficient. That light shines out at the same, golden-hued 2,700 K as the original Cree LEDs using a stated power draw of 9.5 watts.

On paper, these are all perfectly good specs for this sort of bulb. That 9.5-watt power draw gives it an efficiency rating of 68 lumens per watt, same as the Philips SlimStyle BR30 and slightly less than the Philips WarmGlow BR30, which puts out 77 lumens per watt.

Another nice spec is that 10-year warranty, which Cree wisely extended across its entire portfolio of consumer LED offerings. For a time, that 10-year figure was unmatched in the industry, and managed to provide some reassurance to LED longevity skeptics. Now, however, we're starting to see other major manufacturers like GE taking Cree's cue, with decade-long warranties of their own.

In front of our spectrometer, the Cree BR30 LED performed very well. That 650-lumen figure looks to be more or less right on the money, as we were able to rate it right around 655. The color temperature was also quite accurate, falling just ten degrees shy of that 2,700 K target.

In terms of color rendering, the Cree doesn't promise anything higher than average LED performance, with a CRI score of 81. This score, an average of several scores that represent how accurately the bulb illuminates specific shades, includes the same low score on reds that we've seen with other Cree bulbs, something that holds it back a bit when it comes to color accuracy.

To test this out, we set out a colorful photo shoot, lighting each setup with each of the LED floodlights we tested. With its boosted color rendering score, the GE Reveal was the clear winner, with the Philips WarmGlow, the Philips SlimStyle, and the Cree BR30 finishing more or less tied for a distant second. To judge the results for yourself be sure and check out  our full gallery of color rendering comparison shots.

Color rendering can be a pretty subtle thing, and in fairness, many people prefer a more golden glow, even if it tends to yellow things out somewhat. Still, the GE Reveal can claim to be noticeably better with colors -- and it costs less than Cree's floodlight, too.

Dimmability is another big factor worth considering when you're upgrading your light bulbs. Many of today's bulbs, if not most of them, claim to be dimmable -- but some are better at it than others.

In Cree's case, that dimming performance left a bit to be desired. While Cree's floodlight proved dimmable with every switch in our tests, it also failed to dim down quite as low as the other bulbs we tested, cutting out to black at right around 8 percent of its maximum brightness. Another subtle difference, to be sure, but still one worth noting if you're picky about dimmable light.

We also detected a fair amount of flicker as we dialed the light up and down, especially at around half brightness, where fluctuations caused by the dimmer switch rapidly cycling the power on and off tend to cause the most interference. On the bright side, the Cree BR30 didn't buzz noticeably on any of the dimmers.

In fairness, the GIF above exaggerates the flicker problem to a certain extent (there's really no good way to accurately show you what flicker looks like in a picture or video). Still, compared to the GE Reveal, which aced our flicker tests (and produced one of the more boring GIFs we've ever put together), the Cree seems like the lesser option.

One last performance-based point of consideration is how well the bulb's manage heat. Like most electronics, LEDs will produce a small amount of heat, and just like a laptop or a phone, they'll see their performance suffer if they don't do a good job managing it.

This separates LEDs from other kinds of light bulbs, and is the reason why they're typically designed with heat sinks, like the ones around the neck of the Cree BR30. When the bulb first gets turned on, it will see a slight, barely noticeable dip in brightness as things heat up, but then, thanks to those heat sinks, things will plateau out into what manufacturers call the ""steady state,"" which is where the bulbs get rated for things like lumen output and efficiency.

With the Cree BR30 LED, that steady state sits at about 88 percent of the initial brightness, which isn't a bad number in and of itself. However, every other floodlight we tested did better, especially the GE Reveal, which flatlined at closer to 95 percent. If I was choosing a bulb to use in an enclosed fixture, where heat buildup is a greater concern, I'd be inclined to go with a light like that as opposed to the Cree BR30.

In the end, the Cree BR30 LED certainly isn't a bad bulb. It boasts good efficiency specs, an appealing warranty, and suitable performance for everyday household use. It does a perfectly acceptable job -- but so do other LED floodlights, like the  Philips SlimStyle BR30 , which costs just $13. The Editors' Choice  GE Reveal BR30 LED  does an undeniably better job than Cree -- and even that bulb costs a little bit less.

Cree remains a very solid brand with many appealing LEDs. I have no doubt that they'll continue to produce very decent light bulbs, and perhaps even some exceptional ones. But in the case of Cree's BR30 floodlight, the market has caught up, and the value just isn't there."
Philips SlimStyle 75W Replacement LED review:|"

The SlimStyle wing of the Philips family tree is getting a little bigger, with the addition of new 75W replacement versions of the flattened LED lights. Due on Home Depot shelves the final week of November, the new bulbs will retail for $13 each -- cheaper than any other big brand 75W replacement LED currently on the market.

With 1100 lumens to their name, the new SlimStyles offer the expected uptick in brightness over  their 60W replacement predecessors , which put out 800 lumens each. They also offer improved dimming capabilities that won't flicker or buzz, and they boast a slight increase in efficiency, too.

Simply put, everything that was good about the original SlimStyle LED is good about these new ones, too -- along with some key improvements to the design. If you don't care about the extra brightness, the original is still the better value at $9, but among 75W replacements, the new SlimStyle looks like an awfully good deal.

The whole point of the SlimStyle's funky, flat design is to distribute the light-emitting diodes along the perimeter of the bulb, away from its heat-generating base. This eliminates the need for bulky, aluminum heat sinks, which makes the plastic-bodied bulb cheaper to manufacture.

It also makes it incredibly lightweight, at least by LED standards. Like last year's SlimStyle, the 75W replacement variety weighs in at less than 3 ounces -- less than half the weight of the next lightest 75W replacement LED on the market.

The bulb is noticeably larger in size than last year's, though. This is pretty typical of 75W replacements (and even more so of  100W replacements); it shouldn't stop it from fitting into most lamps and fixtures, but be wary of any sconces or enclosures that are tight fits. Also increasingly typical: you'll be able to choose between the standard color temperature of 2,700 K, or a hotter, whiter version that sells at a slightly higher price.

Compared with those other 75W replacements, the SlimStyle is a pretty competitive bulb. Its stated brightness of 1100 lumens puts it right on par with a 75W incandescent, while the power draw of 13 watts makes it one of the most efficient bulbs in its class. With about 85 lumens per watt, it's a more efficient option than  Cree , Sylvania, or  Philips' own non-flattened 75W equivalent LED .

That level of efficiency gives it a yearly operating cost of about a buck and a half at an average of three hours of use per day. That's an obvious improvement over a 75W incandescent, which'll cost you about nine dollars a year to run, but compared with an average 75W replacement CFL, which will add about $2.25 to your yearly energy bill, the savings are less significant. Upgrade from an incandescent, and the SlimStyle will pay for itself within two years. Upgrade from a CFL (compact fluorescent), and that number jumps up to well over a decade.

Something else to factor into the mathematics of long-term value is the bulb's warranty. Like the original SlimStyle, the 75W replacement version only offers three years of coverage. That's not terrible, but it's far less than you'll get with a bulb like the Cree 75W Replacement LED, which offers a 10-year warranty and costs just $2 more upfront.

Across the board, the Philips 75W Replacement SlimStyle LED did very well in our tests. By the obvious metrics -- brightness and efficiency -- it's right at the top of the pack. It also does well with niche concerns like heat management and dimmability.

In our brightness testing, the SlimStyle clocks in at 1137 lumens, comfortably above the stated light output of 1100 lumens. That number is second only to the 1149 lumens that you'll get with the TCP 75W replacement -- a bulb that costs almost twice as much. Interestingly enough, the SlimStyle easily outperformed Philips' standard 75W replacement LED. That bulb claims a lumen output of 1180, but actually comes in well below that 1100 benchmark.

The SlimStyle's brightness isn't 100% omnidirectional, though. With the diodes distributed along the outer perimeter of the horseshoe-like bulb, you'll get more upward light than downward light. Also, you might notice subtle dim areas to each side of the bulb, same as with the original SlimStyle.

Another brightness-related concern is dimmability. Most of today's LEDs promise to dim on demand, but some will dim better than others. The previous SlimStyle LED did poorly in this regard, flickering and buzzing on our dimmer switches  as much as any other LED we tested.

Fortunately, the new SlimStyle shows a lot of improvement in this area. Testing it out on multiple dimmer switches, including an older rotary model intended for incandescents only, the bulb never failed to dim to our satisfaction, and it didn't flicker or buzz one bit. It won't dim down quite as low as I like, cutting out around 12% brightness or so, but it still did well -- enough so that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for someone with dimmer switches in their home, an endorsement I couldn't give the original SlimStyle.

The new SlimStyle boasts one other strong point, and that's the way it manages heat. All LEDs will produce a modest amount of heat as they're left on. This heat will cause a barely noticeable dip in brightness during the first thirty minutes or so of use, before the bulb plateaus at what's called the ""steady state.""

Some bulbs will see a more drastic dip in brightness than others, and some bulbs will take longer to reach a steady state. Both of those results are indicative of a bulb that's particularly sensitive to heat, and one that probably wouldn't be ideal in an enclosed fixture, where the heat can't dissipate.

The SlimStyle is just the opposite, dipping less and hitting its steady state faster than any other 75W replacement in its class, the same as we saw with the original SlimStyle and  the 60W replacements we tested it against. Results like that tell us that these bulbs are really good at dealing with heat, and that they might be the ideal choice for an enclosed fixture.

75W replacement LEDs like the new Philips SlimStyle fall right in a weird middle ground. You'll obviously find better brightness at the 100W level, while 60W replacements will offer better overall value. That makes for a category with a pretty tight window of demand, and one that you might expect manufacturers to gloss over just a tad. The fact that you'll actually find options as decent as the new Philips SlimStyle tells you a lot about just how far the LED market has come in recent years.

For a similarly impressive bulb with a better warranty, you might consider spending an extra two bucks on the Cree 75W Replacement LED. The 75W replacement from TCP might also be worth a look if you're willing to spend extra for a comparable LED that can dim almost cleanly down to zero. Aside from that, though, the Philips SlimStyle looks like your best bet."
Brio's smart outlet puts safety first|"

It's easy to take electrical safety for granted, given how great a role electricity plays in our everyday lives. Yet each year sees thousands of new injuries from household electrical hazards, including injuries to kids. Those are injuries that Brio, a start-up based out of San Diego, thinks it can help prevent.

Brio's product is a smart outlet, but not one with an initial focus on convenience or connectivity. Instead, the focus is safety. By default, Brio's outlet holds the power back until its patented microprocessor senses the electrical demand of a plug. As soon as it does, the juice flows like normal. Stick something else in -- say, a fork -- and it'll keep the electricity at bay, and keep you from getting a shock.

With a slightly large, circular build, each Brio Safe Outlet will take up some extra space on the wall. Aside from that, though, it's designed to look and work exactly like a normal outlet. You'll install the Brio in the same way as you'd install any outlet. Once it's wired in, plug in a lamp, or your laptop, and it'll receive power per usual. Non-plug items, not so much.

Each of Brio's two outlets is wired with an independent safety mechanism. If something's plugged into the top socket, the bottom socket will remain unpowered and kid-safe. If, for some reason, you need to override the current and manually stop power from flowing to one of the outlets, there's a button on Brio that'll do just that.

At $49 each (or $39 for Kickstarter early birds), Brio is definitely priced at a premium compared to the standard outlets you're already using, especially if you're going to be replacing a whole home's worth of them. It's also markedly more expensive than simply placing plastic safety plugs into each socket. Still, parents of small children who might be tempted to investigate the conveniently low-to-the-ground slots in the wall might find it to be a worthy investment.

Brio's Safe Outlets are slated to ship out to Kickstarter backers by next summer. Down the road, Brio's team plans to add new, app-enabled designs capable of communicating with external sensors to monitor for things like smoke, leaks, and carbon monoxide.

Given that, it might be worth waiting for the next generation before buying in on too grand a scale, but still, as a means of kid-proofing a nursery or playroom, Brio looks like the sort of intelligent, safety-minded solution that ought to be just as ubiquitous as electricity itself."
Osram 60W Replacement Ultra LED review:|"

With LED prices continuing to fall, we're seeing more and more bulbs selling for $10 or less. One of the latest options is the Osram 60W Replacement Ultra LED, which rings in just a few cents shy of that 10-buck benchmark.

Thankfully, this lower price plateau doesn't represent a dip in quality, at least not with Osram. With well over 800 lumens of light output from a power draw of just 8.5 watts, it's one of the most efficient 60W replacement LEDs we've tested, and it performed well during our dimming tests, too. That makes it an easy bulb to recommend, even among an increasingly crowded field of worthwhile competitors.

Osram's 60W Replacement Ultra LED doesn't sport an inventive build like the Philips SlimStyle or the  Cree 4Flow LED , and it doesn't show off its heat sinks the way the  original Cree 60W Replacement LED  does. At first glance, it's just a fairly typical-looking light bulb, which might be a good thing if you're a fan of inconspicuous design.

Turn the bulb on, and you'll find the same, golden glow that you'll get with the majority of the bulbs on the market these days, along with a light output of 800 lumens, making it a worthy replacement for the brightness of a 60W incandescent. That's all well and good, but there's nothing on the surface helping this bulb stand out from the crowd.

That all changes once you peek under the hood. Osram's bulb puts that light out from a power draw of just 8.5 watts -- the lowest power draw of any 60W replacement LED we've tested. That makes it the most efficient 60W replacement we've tested, with a very impressive 94 lumens per watt to its name -- a full 10 lumens-per-watt better than its nearest competitor, the Cree LED.

That efficiency adds up to energy savings over the course of the Osram LED's 25,000-hour lifespan. Run the thing for an average of three hours per day, and it'll add just over a buck to your utility bill each year.

Of course, those savings don't mean a whole lot if the bulb isn't built to last. To this end, Osram backs up its LED with a five-year warranty -- better than cheaper alternatives like the Cree 4Flow LED and the Philips SlimStyle, but not as good as the equally-priced original Cree LED, which still sells with a warranty of 10 years.

Something else to consider is what type of setting you'll be using the bulb in. Osram's LED is rated for dampness, so you can use it outdoors if it isn't directly exposed to things like rain and snow. Osram recommends avoiding enclosed fixtures, though, as the heat buildup can shorten the bulb's lifespan.

For those who like a hotter, more whitish color temperature from their light bulbs, Osram offers an equally efficient version of its Ultra LED that sells for $11. If brightness isn't as important to you, 40W versions are also available starting at $8.

The Osram LED held up to our battery of tests, and yielded a few interesting results. We were able to confirm the power draw, clocking it just under the stated 8.5 watts on our variable transformer. In front of our spectrometer, the color temperature came out to 2,580K, which is noticeably lower than the stated 2,700K. Comparing Osram's LED with the Cree LED, which comes in much closer to that 2,700K target, you can definitely tell that it tacks more toward the reddish end of the spectrum.

The color rendering index score was also low, coming in at 78 out of 100.  Color rendering refers to a given light source's ability to accurately illuminate different shades and tones -- a bulb with a higher score should make the colors in your home look a little more vivid. Most LEDs sit right at 80, while some, like the  Cree TW Series LED , the  GE Reveal line of LEDs , and even the bargain-priced  Ikea Ledare LED , manage to push the score considerably higher. Given competitors like that (especially the Ledare LED, which only costs $5), I wish Osram would have aimed a bit higher here.

We also make sure to test out each bulb using an integrating sphere -- really just a big, hollow ball of Styrofoam with a carefully applied coat of reflective paint on the inside. With the bulb in the middle and the spectrometer peeking in, we can measure brightness with a very high degree of accuracy.

Osram impressed us here, coming in with a reading of 852 lumens -- comfortably higher than the stated 800 lumens. The only 60W replacement LED to rank higher is the  Philips 60W Equivalent LED , which our spectrometer read at 864 lumens. Of course, that LED is also less efficient than Osram's, with a higher power draw of 11 watts.

The uptick in light output is a good thing given Osram's low color temperature, as people tend to see more spatial brightness from ""hotter"" light sources. It also bolsters the efficiency argument. Recalculate the ratio using 852 lumens instead of 800, and you'll find that the bulb is actually putting out just over 100 lumens per watt.

Osram can claim strong dimmability with its bulb, too. On our dimming rig, we were able to dial the light down with each switch we tested. On some, we were able to dim smoothly from 100% brightness down to 0% brightness, which is a terrific result.

Unlike a fair number  of the LEDs we've tested, Osram's bulb didn't buzz one bit on any of the dimmers we used it on. We did, however, detect a small amount of occasional flicker at low settings. Though barely noticeable to the naked eye, it still undercut the otherwise perfect dimming performance, and stops me from recommending the Osram LED over our current dimmability pick, the Philips 60W Equivalent.

You've got  an increasing number of LED options at this price point, and Osram has done a nice job of making sure that its bulb can compete in that kind of market. With ample brightness, omnidirectional light output, and impressive efficiency, the Osram 60W Replacement Ultra LED performs its core function admirably well, and offers strong dimming performance to boot. At $10, it's a very solid choice for more efficient household lighting."
Shade brings learning software to a light switch|"

Shade wants to build a closer relationship between you and your light switch. As you use it, it learns your preferences for brightness and color and begins to automate the process by anticipating your needs. What's more, Shade promises that the switch's embedded photocells will even save energy (and you a few bucks) by adapting to ambient light and dimming the bulb when sunlight is strong.

Compatible with  Philips color changing LEDs  and regular dimmable bulbs, the Shade Light Switch installs over a standard switch box, both rocker-style and single pole. A simple dial hides the more advanced functionality underneath and gives the switch the familiar look of a standard dimming knob. Turn and push the dial for basic controls or use the iOS or Android apps to set and customize schedules over Wi-Fi.

The Kickstarter campaign supporting Shade launched on Tuesday. You'll get one dimmer for a pledge of $88 (which converts to about £56 in the UK and AU$101), a package of three costs $239 (£151 and AU$274) and there are sets of five and 10 dimmers available as well. Shade will ship anywhere in the world once it's ready. The hardware is still being prototyped, and the estimated delivery date isn't until August 2015.

Curiously, Lime Green Labs, the startup behind Shade, is offering Arduino boards and a download of the Arduino source code with several Kickstarter packages. Packages with just DIY instructions and no units will arrive as early as December. Thus, its software will be shippable eight months before the hardware is ready. It seems odd to offer DIY enthusiasts a way to craft a homemade Shade on their own without paying for the actual product.

Though I like that supporters have the option to do it themselves, I also wonder whether Shade is confident it can get the hardware right. The prototype shown in the Kickstarter video looks workable, but it is large. Lime Green Labs knows what it has in the software, and it's almost ready. Getting the hardware down to size so it can fit seamlessly into a wall switch will indeed be a difficult task.

The software's dimming feature does look cool. Either you set a preferred brightness level, or it learns through your usage and the photocells adjust to how bright you prefer your room to be. Then, it balances ambient light vs. bulb output to keep an even level. As mentioned, if more sunlight streams through the window, Shade will dim the lighting level accordingly. And if a cloud covers the sun, the switch should adjust again.

Shade also promises that you can manually turn the lights on or off, or adjust the lighting level without interrupting your scheduling in the future. Add in geolocation and the ability to learn color preferences with Philips Hue bulbs, and Shade's list of features becomes impressively long. I'm concerned, though, that Shade will be able to deliver on all of its goals. Though  Nest's thermostat  proved that learning technology can bring new life to old home features, the long list of variables that Shade hopes to control -- from brightness to color to automated schedules -- is a big challenge.

Once the initial model is released, Lime Green Labs is planning updates, including  IFTTT compatibility and the ability to share schedules across switches. Those are promising, but there's one more update I'd like to see. Though a single switch can control a bank of regular lights or a group of Hue bulbs, it can't yet adjust those Hue bulbs individually for true customization.

Despite a push for home automation, physical controls are making a comeback. Indeed, a common problem with smart products is their reliance on apps and the difficulty of syncing usage for multiple family members. Restricting physical interaction in exchange for digital controls becomes tedious when you have to tell someone not to flip a switch because it'll interfere with your automation.

Fixing that problem through both physical and app controls is the core of the light switch's appeal, but it's not the only product to do so. The  Wink Relay , another wall mounted switch takes a similar approach. It has customizable buttons and a touchscreen that can act as a central control panel to a setup of connected devices. It's more comprehensive than Shade, but it also costs $300 (and is only available in the US).

Its affordable price and learning capabilities make Shade unique in the field of lighting. It could act as a nice meeting point between different smart bulbs and standard bulbs throughout a house. If its software is as good as it says and if Lime Green Labs can get the hardware right, Shade looks to be an interesting next step in smart-bulb capabilities."
Insteon debuts a dual smart outlet|"

Today was an especially busy day in smart home news, with  seven new Wink-ready gadgets from Quirky and  new Samsung appliance integrations for the SmartThings platform. Not one to be left out, Insteon's announcing some news of its own, with a brand new smart outlet set to rival the freshly unveiled  Quirky Outlink .

Insteon hopes its outlet rises to the top thanks to a dual-control design that'll let you manage each socket independently from one another. That makes Insteon's outlet the first of its kind, and might give it a leg up over Quirky, as the Outlink only lets you automate the top socket.

Insteon's outlet will require an existing Insteon-compatible control devices, such as the  Insteon Hub . Once you're set up, you'll be able to automate each socket or turn it on or off remotely through the Insteon app, available for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone devices. Thanks to  a deal with Microsoft, Windows Phone users will enjoy a few extra bells and whistles, including Live Tiles and  integration with Cortana.

The Insteon On/Off Outlet is available starting today, and set to retail at $60 for a plain white finish, or $65 for a colored finish. That makes it a touch pricier than the $50 Quirky Outlink, but with two built-in smart sockets instead of one, many home-automation enthusiasts might see value here."
Quirky's Outlink disguises smarts in a standard-looking wall outlet|"

At today's Quirky event in New York,  the startup announced seven new products, bringing Wink capability to a number of new frontiers in your home. They'd previously made managing power possible with their  Pivot Power Genius , a surge protector with smarts. Now, with the Quirky Outlink, you can bring smarts to any outlet without the need of an extra bulky device.

You can install the Outlink over any 15 amp duplex outlet. The bottom plug gives you a standard option, while the top plug offers connected smarts. You can control the power of anything plugged in on top remotely via the iOS or Android app, so you can check to make sure the TV is off when at the office, for instance. Quirky does not offer desktop functionality for the Outlink yet.

You'll need a  Wink Hub  or  Wink Relay  to operate the Outlink, which cost $80 and $300 respectively, making its standalone price point of $50 much steeper if you haven't already invested in the Quirky ecosystem.

Once up and running, you'll be able to use the app to turn the top plug on or off remotely or set a schedule. The Outlink will also be able to monitor energy usage, and you can customize alerts so you'll stay informed if you're going over an expected budget.

All in all, the Outlink shares a lot of the same functionality as the  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch . Belkin's product costs $60, and offers scheduling smarts, remote capability, energy monitoring, and wider product compatibility via online rule generator  IFTTT. The  original Belkin switch  costs $10 less, but sacrifices the energy readings.

The capabilities of Belkin's switches and the Outlink look very similar. The Outlink will get its interoperability from the many products compatible with Wink Hubs. The main difference between the two, if the Outlink can perform up to its promise, will be the design. Belkin's switches simply plug in to your wall, providing some flexibility as you can quickly move the switch around to wherever you might need it, but they'll also stick out once in place. The install for the Outlink will inevitably be more complicated, as you'll need to replace your switch, but once up and running, I can see myself appreciating such a discreet connected product.

You can preorder the Outlink now on Quirky's website. The expected delivery date is December 21, 2014, so if you're excited about having a smart wall outlet, you won't have too long to wait."
Quirky Tripper keeps tabs on your windows, doors, and drawers|"

The Quirky Tripper brings door and window sensing skills to its lineup of smart home gadgets for less than the competition. Unveiled at a  press conference in New York, the $40 Tripper kit acts as a digital tripwire able to detect when entryways to your abode open or close unexpectedly and pushes alerts directly to the Wink mobile application.

Additionally the Tripper bundle, which consists of two pairs of separate magnetic sensor units ( four parts in all), can also give users a warning when drawers or cabinet doors have been breached. And like the new  Norm  smart thermostat device, the Tripper is designed to integrate with Quirky's growing list of connected home products.

Keep in mind that you'll have to already have the  Wink Hub  networking center or  Wink Relay  wall-mounted gadget already up and running inside your abode for the Tripper to function.

A key difference between the Tripper and other similar aperture sensors is that Quirky will sell it as a two-pack for same price competing smart home players hawk just one unit. For example both SmartThings and Peq offer essentially identical gadgets for $45 and $35 respectively.

As far as availability goes, Quirky expects the Tripper to ship in the US by December 2014 for $40. You can, however, preorder the sensor and other Quirky accessories via the company's website now."
Quirky goes modular with the reinvented Spotter Uniq|"

In  a sweeping announcement that included six other new products, Quirky announced a new, modular reinvention of the  Spotter Multipurpose Sensor . Starting at just $30 and dubbed the Spotter Uniq, the new device allows users to pick up to four sensors or functions from an expanded variety of options.

Sensor options include what we saw in last year's Spotter (sound, motion, light, temperature, and humidity), along with several new additions, including air quality, carbon monoxide, barometric pressure, and moisture detectors. You'll also be able to add buttons, an LED screen, a lithium ion battery, a microphone, speakers, a gyroscope, or an accelerometer.

In addition to the sensors, you'll be able to customize the look of the device, too, with white, black, and green finishes available for each component, as well as the body of the device itself. Choose any of the finishes for a uniform design, or mix and match your colors -- it's up to you.

Like the rest of the tech in the Quirky + GE family, you'll control the Spotter Uniq through the free Wink app for Android and iOS devices. Like the original Spotter, you'll be able to program the different sensors to trigger other connected gadgets in your Wink ecosystem. Motion detection could trigger a lamp to turn on, for instance.

In our tests, we've always come away impressed with the Wink app, though some of Quirky's products -- including last year's Spotter -- haven't performed up to our expectations. If the hardware in the Spotter Uniq is truly new and improved, then it looks to be an especially smart addition to Quirky's lineup.

With a starting price of $30 (or as much as $120, depending on the tech you choose), the Spotter Uniq can be ordered online starting today, along with Quirky's other new additions, which include  a connected garage door opener , and  the Norm , Quirky's stab at a smart thermostat. The Spotter Uniq will be built small batch at Quirky's new microfactory in San Francisco, CA. Units are expected to ship out in December of this year.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is a developing story -- check back for updates, including hands on coverage."
Subtle home security from a single Point|"

2014 has seen a veritable glut of security-minded gadgets on crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, all of them looking to add some sort of sensor tech into your living room. One of the latest examples is Point, an app-enabled smoke detector with additional sensors capable of monitoring things like temperature spikes, humidity levels, and unusual noises.

Point's low-key design promises ""a softer take on home security,"" and at a Kickstarter price of $79 (£50, AU$92, converted roughly), it costs considerably less than competing all-in-one sensor units like  Piper  or  Canary . The obvious tradeoff is that you aren't getting a built-in camera -- though Point's team paints this as a positive, claiming that surveillance devices ultimately compromise the sort of relaxed atmosphere you want when you're at home.

The camera-less design puts Point more in line with devices like the  Quirky Spotter  and  Nest Protect , neither of which seem adequate as standalone security gadgets, and don't market themselves as such. To set itself apart, Point promises a robust smartphone app with fully customizable alerts. Along with the usual push notifications, Point can sound an alarm during an emergency, or glow a specific color to provide a more subtle alert when it detects something like cigarette smoke, or a TV turned up too loud late at night.

In addition, Point is promising IFTTT compatibility, which should open the door for useful integrations with other smart home devices, including  Philips Hue LEDs ,  Belkin WeMo Switches , and  SmartThings. For what it's worth, Point's also claiming to work with Lockitron to offer remote control over your deadbolt -- though most of that gadget's initial backers still haven't received their devices.

With so many new security options out there, it'll be interesting to see whether or not Point's approach can pull away from the pack. As of writing this, the Kickstarter campaign looks to be well on its way to a successful finish, but we'll reserve final judgment of the product's merits until at least July 2015, when units are expected to begin shipping out."
Peq Watchdog review:|"

On the surface the $199 Peq Watchdog kit appears to be a home surveillance solution that's stuck in the past. Its included camera lacks many of the fancy features you'll find in cheaper competitors from Dropcam and Belkin such as built-in motion sensors or two-way audio. The Peq's artificial eye can't even capture images and video in HD, since it tops out at a grainy VGA resolution.

Don't be too quick to count out the Watchdog though because the bundle also connects to a wider world of smart home gadgets which the backers of Peq hope will power the smart home of the future. Other attributes which offset the Watchdog's shortcomings are a simple setup process, a rule-based action engine, and presence modes to better command smart home activities and alerts.

All of this makes the Peq Watchdog compelling to those who want the bare bones to build a complete and homogeneous smart home system in the near future. Of course you also have to swallow the $10 per month subscription to use any Peq product, the only smart home solution which demands this. Otherwise, products like the  Dropcam Pro  and  Belkin Netcam HD+  are  more flexible and offer better deals right out of the box.

Though the Peq store hawks numerous add-on products and devices, inside the $200 Watchdog kit you'll find three basic pieces of smart home hardware: a main Hub unit built by networking specialist Netgear, a Door & Window sensor and a Wi-Fi camera. Peq sells many of these gadgets separately too, specifically the camera ($130) and Door & Window sensor ($35).

Unfortunately, unlike other connected-home platforms you can't buy the networking hub on its own. For instance Peq offers a Starter Kit bundle which includes the Hub plus Door & Window sensor for $120. The trouble is there's not a lot you can do with this no frills kit, at least if you're keen on seeing what's happening within your abode remotely. Adding the camera to the mix, however, brings the total cost up to a steep $250, which makes springing for the Watchdog a no brainer.

So what exactly can you accomplish with the Peq Watchdog package? Unfortunately in terms of home security, pretty much the bare minimum. To my surprise only one of the bundle's sensors qualifies as an active, smart device. You'd be tempted to think the camera is the one with the brains in this outfit, I know I did, but sadly that's not the case.

Indeed while other more sophisticated products from Dropcam and Belkin boast cameras which also contain motion sensors, the Peq imaging device does not. Essentially a dumb, unblinking digital eye, the Peq optical gizmo must be told when to snap pictures and record video by another device nearby. In this case it's either the bundled Door & Window sensor or a Peq Motion sensor that'll set you back an extra $45.

This might not sound like a big deal since you can have the door or window sensor stand in for the motion detector and act as a tripwire for the camera. In this arrangement the Watchdog gets the job done, specifically if you merely want the Peq camera to take pictures and video when something foul is afoot. And granted there certainly aren't many events more sinister than an unplanned door or window opening, especially when you're away.

Those expecting the Peq Watchdog kit to capture pet escapades or the shenanigans of your children on the sly, however, will be very disappointed. Aside from the Peq camera's lack of internal motion-detection (or the ability to pick-up or transmit sound), the imaging device has a low VGA resolution at 640x480. The images and video I took with the Peq system were fuzzy and washed out compared with material snared by full-HD Wi-Fi cameras such as the  Dropcam Pro  and Belkin  NetCam HD+ .

And while the Peq camera can see in the dark thanks to its infrared emitters and is even rated to operate outdoors, these abilities are blunted by the fact that Peq's optional motion sensor module is made for indoor use only. Similar in size and shape to the SmartSense Motion Sensor by SmartThings, the square and tile-like Peq gadget is wireless, portable, but not rugged or water resistant. So unless you want to risk damage (or theft) of the accessory I suggest you leave everything indoors.

Another weakness in the Peq platform, and more importantly with the Watchdog kit's usefulness as a home security system is how it handles alerts. In contrast with  Dropcam  and  Belkin Wi-Fi cameras , the Peq mobile application doesn't support in-app push notifications.

To be fair the system does have the power to send homeowners SMS texts along with emails triggered by events within the home. That said, nothing cuts through the clutter of clogged email inboxes or even lists of texts quite like a systemwide phone alert. Also consider the fact that Peq limits you to 20 text messages per day, though the bucket for emails is bottomless.

A simple way to help address the alert issue would be to provide some form of siren module or alert function. For instance ,SmartThings sells the Fortrezz Siren Strobe Alarm ($49) for its connected home platform. Similarly, the Piper home security kit will sound an ear-splitting alarm when suspicious events happen.

Frankly it's a feature I wish more was more common in security-minded smart home packages. If I take the trouble to deploy smart sensors throughout my home, not to mention a camera, the least a security system could do is reliably wake me up if trouble strikes at night.

Peq does offer a generous cloud-based storage policy for photos and video the camera records. Included in the mandatory $10 per month subscription fee is storage space for up to 20 video clips (about 16 seconds each) and 40 images a day. Of course both media are low resolution and Peq will delete everything of off its servers every 30 days. You do have the option to download photos and video directly, though only to mobile devices using either the Android or iOS version of the Peq mobile app.

It's hard to judge the true appeal of Peq however, unless you acknowledge its aim to become a full-blown smart home platform. Yes, Peq has aspirations which go way beyond simple domestic security. Smart Home Ventures, the company behind Peq also sells additional devices which integrate into the Peq system such as plug in modules to control dimmable lamps or other small appliances ($60 and $55, respectively).

You can also buy a Peq Smart Thermostat (built by CentraLite) for $130 which costs significantly less than fancier models from Nest ($249) and Honeywell ($279) but lacks advanced skills such as geofencing, motion detection and local weather reports.

Other pieces of the Peq smart-home puzzle include the aforementioned Peq Motion sensor ($45) which not only keeps an infrared eye out for hot-blooded intruders but also pulls double duty as a digital thermometer. There's a water sensor as well ($50) which looks out for plumbing problems along with a carbon monoxide detector ($90) designed to sniff out the presence of deadly CO gas.

One thing I must say I like about the Peq system is its painless setup process. You have two methods for installing the hub and adding devices to the smart home network. One is through the Peq website interface and the second is via the Peq Home mobile app (available for Android or iOS tablets and smartphones).

No matter which option you choose, the interface provides simple wizards that walk you through the installation procedure step by step. I especially like the detailed video tutorials embedded at the head of each device category install menu. For instance if you'd like to set up a small appliance or a lamp, just watch the video first then begin the slide-based instructions. Peq also lists an estimate of the expected installation time too.

Thanks to all the virtual help I was able to quickly hook up the Peq Hub (physically connected to my home router over Ethernet) then activate and deploy the camera and Door & Window sensor. Linking to the Hub via Wi-Fi wireless networking, each install operation was fast. In the case of simple gadgets like the Door & Window sensor it only took a few minutes to forge a successful connection. More complex devices such as the camera needed about 20 minutes. And since Peq is a complete smart home solution, I also added the Peq Motion sensor, water sensor, and a bedside lamp module as well -- all a cinch to get up and running.

It was a lot harder to get the Peq Smart Thermostat working properly but that's because I had to shut down the power to my home's AC unit, remove my existing programmable thermostat, then swap in the new Peq temperature control system. It just proves that all the handy install wizards and walk-throughs in the world are a poor substitute for basic electrical experience. That said, like the Nest, this thermostat doesn't require a C wire which some home central air systems, like mine, lack. That can make it easier to install, just be sure your HVAC circuit is robust enough to handle the thermostat borrowing power. If in doubt, call in a professional installer.

I'm happy to report that by and large using the Peq system on a daily basis is just as easy and painless as its setup. Both the website and mobile apps use a clean tile-like interface complete with big icons for various sensors and devices placed around the home. Occupying the main slot is a live video feed from the camera, followed by (in my case) the thermostat, a bedroom light, a back-door sensor, and a motion sensor I installed in my living room. That's where I also placed the Peq Camera. Lastly was a water sensor which I dropped next to my hot water heater, a trouble zone in the past.

After all my home gadgets were deployed I quickly set up a few rules to command my fledgling Peq network with more automation. For instance I made it so that anytime a motion or door/window sensor detected activity while I wasn't home or otherwise indisposed (i.e., in away, vacation, and night modes), the system sent me a text message plus an email.

I also told the camera to fire off pictures and a video clip when the living room motion sensor detected movement. Additionally I had Peq turn on my bedroom lamp during night mode under the same conditions. The idea here is to use all of Peq's tools to wake me in the absence of a real siren or alarm function.

Thankfully Peq implemented all my custom settings reliably and with speed. Seconds after my back door opened unexpectedly or unsanctioned motion was detected, I received a text. The same sort of agility happened when the kiddos barreled into the living room at the crack of dawn, tripping on my bedroom light and forcing a cascade of buzzing to crest across multiple devices simultaneously (Android tablets, my phone and smartwatch, etc).

Of course no smart home solution I've seen is perfect and Peq is no exception. Aside from the rather unsophisticated camera, my main gripes reside in the Peq Home mobile application. Specifically, while you can both create and activate rules of action through the online website, the mobile app only allows you to toggle them on and off.

And for all the apps' attempts to flaunt a smooth, modern look, it often demonstrated buggy behavior. For instance I decided to add the optional lamp module which in the install wizard offers a choice to either designate it as dimmable light source or one with a simple on/off switch. Even though I selected the latter, it appeared as dimmable once I completed the set up.

Furthermore the dimmer (represented as a slider bar) responded slowly to my fingertip swipes. The slider acted erratically too, swinging wildly up or down as the lamp ramped up or turned down its power usage. To be fair, you can circumvent the whole issue by adding your lamp to the Peq system as a plain appliance and by selecting the non-dimmable option.

The Peq website certainly talks up the benefits of its smart home platform, from greater convenience of home automation to the extra piece of mind you'll enjoy through increased home security. That's why I expected a lot from the Peq Watchdog kit. Priced at $200, the bundle definitely isn't cheap, especially considering the original Dropcam ($149) and current  Belkin  Netcam HD+  ($130) Wi-Fi cameras cost much less. Now factor in these competing models' built-in motion sensing, audio recording, and sharper HD resolutions.

Up against this is the Peq Watchdog's  lo-res VGA camera, no audio capture skills, and complete lack of an internal motion sensor. Frankly they are flaws that are hard to forgive, especially in a stand-alone home security bundle. Being part of a larger Peq vision for the smart home, however, you do have options for a fix. For instance if you add $45 to the Watchdog kit's $200 by also buying the optional Peq Motion sensor, one of my main gripes with the Watchdog disappears. That said, the camera would still take grainy photos and video and can't record, let alone transmit, audio.

It also seems risky to me to commit to any smart home solution that is closed since this emerging product category is constantly changing and evolving. I'd further stress that Peq is asking customers to literally bet on its chances of success by charging a $10 monthly fee. If you're in the mood to gamble I suggest doubling down on the  SmartThings  platform which is wide open to developers and gadget makers to adopt.

So ultimately I'd avoid this particular Peq security package until it either gets a much better camera or drops significantly in price. In the meantime both  Dropcam Pro  and Belkin Netcam HD+ or smarter choices."
Homeboy review:|"

Homeboy is a bit of a security camera rebel. Rather than copying  other DIY models, this nonconformist security camera company decided to do its own thing.

Its $150 camera (international availability is slated for 2015, but there's no pricing information just yet; direct conversions would be about £95 or AU$170) doesn't have live streaming or HD video, so don't even think about Homeboy if you want a webcam or prioritize top-quality resolutions. Instead, Homeboy focuses on mobility via a long-lasting, rechargeable battery. This makes it possible for you to mount your camera pretty much anywhere -- anywhere indoors, that is -- and still enjoy the benefits of motion-related push and email alerts, night vision and free 30-day rolling cloud storage.

Despite its more minimalist take on DIY security, Homeboy also has a built-in siren, arm and disarm modes tied to your phone's GPS location as well as its own IFTTT channel. These factors combine to create an elegantly-executed security camera that gives you just enough functionality without taking up a ton of bandwidth.

Homeboy is a white plastic camera about the size of a billiard ball. It comes with a detachable magnetic base so you can easily set it up on a flat surface or use the included adhesive to mount it to a wall. The camera itself has a large magnetic section so you can rotate and re-position it as needed for just the right angle.

For a paired-down DIY security camera, Homeboy has a lot of features. Still, it won't look particularly impressive in a side-by-side comparison with cameras like the  Dropcam Pro . That's because Homeboy purposely took a different approach -- focusing instead on freedom of movement and simplicity rather than continuous cloud storage and comparatively-high bandwidth requirements.

Homeboy's lithium polymer battery is designed to last for up to three months before needing a charge. The company points to its low-power Wi-Fi tech as the reason for Homeboy's impressive battery life. It also claims that only 500 milliseconds pass from the time the camera detects motion to when it starts to record video. I didn't really have a way of testing that particular claim, but it definitely captured events as they were happening, rather than missing the action.

Homeboy's camera captures video at 640x480, which, unlike  DoorBot , wasn't particularly bad. Of course, it wasn't as sharp as cameras with 720p or higher, but I was able to easily make out what was happening in the saved clips in both day- and night-vision modes.

I like that Homeboy has arm and disarm modes that can tie into your phone's GPS locator. Enabling the ""arm with GPS"" feature automatically armed the camera when I left and disarmed it when I returned. Similar to setting a home and away schedule, I received motion-related push and email alerts while I was out and I didn't have to worry about receiving them when I returned. You can disable or override this feature, as needed, but I found it to work extremely well -- especially since I didn't want hundreds of clips of myself walking back and forth.

You can also record your own clips on demand. So even though you can't see what's going on 24/7 via live streaming, you can hit the ""record now"" button whenever you want and adjust the length of the clip to anything from 5 to 30 seconds. You can also extend unlimited access to what Homeboy calls your ""crew"" so friends and family can also receive alerts and respond to potential security breaches.

The camera also has the ability to sound a siren (it wasn't terribly loud, but it would definitely startle an intruder), record audio whenever it captures video (it doesn't have separate audio alerts, though) and set an emergency phone number that will display on the video clip screen in case you need to quickly make a call.

The IFTTT channel was a welcome addition to Homeboy's basic functionality. I created three separate recipes. The first one turned on the lamp connected to a  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch  every time it sensed motion. It worked well, except this recipe was rather anticlimactic when the light was already turned on. You could also pair your Philips Hue LEDs to Homeboy and have them flash or change color.

I also had Homeboy send my saved video clips to Dropbox for a simple, free local storage option (you can also send them to Google Drive) and send me a text message whenever it detected motion. Up until this point, the free  Manything iOS security camera app  has been the only ""security camera"" with an IFTTT channel. That makes Homeboy a bit of an IFTTT channel pioneer, bringing it closer to tons of different third-party products and services, including  SmartThings .

Homeboy's setup was incredibly seamless. I downloaded the app on my iPhone 5 (an Android app is currently in the works) and followed the instructions to get started. I created an account and selected ""setup camera."" From there, it walked me through a series of simple steps, including setting my location, opting in to the ""arm by GPS"" feature, charging the camera (a USB cord is included) and entering my Wi-Fi information. The camera takes a couple of hours to fully charge (the camera works while it's charging) and, although I didn't test Homeboy over time, is supposed to last for a few months on one charge.

The only issue I ran into during testing related to the Wi-Fi connection. When the Wi-Fi cut out, so did the camera and I would get an email telling me that Homeboy has lost contact with my camera. That happened a couple of times and the connection didn't always return right away. So, any of the motion detection that happened during the outage period would start to come through with a vengeance after the Wi-Fi connection was restored -- not super helpful if there was a real security threat, but, of course that's more of a network complaint than a concern with Homeboy's core functionality.

But that does raise the question of Wi-Fi-connected home security in general and how reliable it really is.  Link-Union's Link-U Hybrid SmartCam  is in the middle of an Indiegogo campaign and lists optional cellular backup (by way of a data SIM card) among its many features. Of course, you'd have to pay for the SIM card, but it would theoretically solve any Wi-Fi connection wonkiness.

At $150, Homeboy is an affordable DIY camera that gracefully tackles basic home security, while still managing to offer a handful of extra features. Although it doesn't deliver the sharpest video clips or offer 24/7 live streaming, Homeboy will still record clear footage and let you know it detected a potential security breach right away. The free, rolling 30-day unlimited clip storage is appealing and its rechargeable battery and IFTTT channel will bring a new level of customization to your DIY setup. Homeboy is available for pre-order now in the US, with units scheduled to begin shipping November 1."
The AirGuard secondhand smoke detector is ready to narc|"

New Hampshire-based company FreshAir Sensor was founded by Dartmouth Professor of Chemistry, Joe BelBruno. FreshAir Sensor's creation, benignly dubbed ""AirGuard,"" could easily become the bane of a bunch of college-age kid's existence -- or really any occasionally-rule-breaking smoker living in a place with a strict no-smoking policy.

Supposedly, AirGuard is able to sense airborne concentrations of organic compounds found in cigarettes and marijuana smoke.

AirGuard comes in two forms -- as a two-plug adapter that fits over existing wall outlets, complete with tamper-resistant screws or as a palm-sized battery-powered device that looks a bit like the  Nest Protect . The plug version, at least, seems like it would be very tough to flummox.

AirGuard units are designed to operate continuously and store data in real-time so your landlord, RA, hotel manager or other authority figure can check in on you 24/7. And if they don't happen to be staring at their screens just waiting for a violation to take place, they'll get a timestamped notification anyway.

The plug-in detector uses a Wi-Fi connection to send infraction information to a central monitoring system, which results in an email to the AirGuard admin. The hand-held device relies on Bluetooth and works in concert with an Android app.

There's no word yet on pricing for either of these products or when the plug-in detector will be available, but the wearable version is expected to make its debut in Spring 2015."
Turn your old smartphone into a new security system with Rico|"

Rico is a cute, colorful dog-shaped device packed with motion, temperature, smoke, carbon monoxide and humidity sensors. The companion Android and iOS apps let you view sensor-related stats at-a-glance and receive alerts based on security, safety and environmental triggers.

There's more behind Rico's adorable facade than built-in sensors, though.

You can also stick an old smartphone inside this plastic puppy-hub to tack on HD camera, microphone, loudspeaker, 3G and Wi-Fi capabilities. Startup MindHelix says these features should work even if your phone has a broken screen.

Starting at $99 (at the current exchange rate, that's £60 in the UK and AU$110 in Australia), Rico is compatible with Android 2.2 and higher and iOS 6 and higher. And, supposedly, it's large enough to accommodate a max screen size of 5.7 inches. That's just enough space for the larger Note 3 and iPhone 6 Plus.

This blend of sensors and smartphone functionality takes Rico from a sensor kit to a more complete,  Piper -like all-in-one home security system. But MindHelix isn't the first company to think up a smartphone-repurposing plan; we've seen a handful of other companies reuse Android and iOS devices for clever smart home applications.

The  Manything app  is one example. This free iOS app takes an old iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch and converts it to a security camera in minutes, complete with ""night vision"" (thanks to your phone's flashlight), alerts with motion detection zones and an IFTTT channel -- features I wouldn't have expected to find in a free app.

The free Presence iOS app is pretty similar to Manything. It doesn't have its own IFTTT channel, but it does provide details on energy usage to help you save money on your monthly bill.

There's also Wise Labs'  Bemo . If you have an old Android or iOS device collecting dust at home and happen to be in the market for a new thermostat, you can remove your current model and replace it with Bemo's wire port panel. Then you can mount your smart device over the panel to act as your new, touchscreen thermostat display.

Turning a smartphone into a smart home device is a really intriguing option, particularly for folks who don't want to spend hundreds on a security camera, security system or thermostat. But that does make Rico seem a bit pricey, especially since it's really just a (decidedly endearing) housing for your phone. The sensors are a nice addition, but your old phone is really doing all of the home-security heavy-lifting.

Still, it's half the price of Icontrol's Piper, so it's definitely a less expensive option if  you want a security camera, an app with alerts and a whole bunch of sensors -- and maybe the Rico exterior will mask the contents inside from any would-be smartphone thieves. Maybe.

MindHelix is also working on Rico-compatible plug accessories called Smart Sockets. You can use the same Rico app to control Smart Socket-connected lamps, coffee makers and other small electronic devices a la the  Belkin WeMo Switch .

There's just one day left on MindHelix's Rico and Smart Socket Kickstarter campaign, but it's already exceeded its $100,000 funding goal. Prices for a single Rico unit start at $99, and $110 for one Rico unit and one Smart Socket (converted, that's £70 and AU$125). MindHelix expects to send production models to early backers in November 2015; additional fees apply for international shipping."
Cree 11W LED with 4Flow Filament design (soft white) review:|"

Everything old is new again. Case in point: Cree's new LED, built to imitate the incandescents of old as closely as possible. It's an understandable addition to Cree's lineup, given the recent changes to the lighting landscape. With phased-out incandescents gradually disappearing from store shelves, more and more consumers simply want to be able to find something familiar.

Consumers want bulbs that are affordable, too, and to this point, Cree's new LED costs just $8 -- its cheapest yet. That's not a huge price drop from  the brand's original LED  -- at $10, that bulb boasts slightly more efficient performance and a much longer warranty. That LED isn't going anywhere, and I think that it might still be the better overall value. Still, if you've been holding out for a solid performing, low-price LED that doesn't stick out like a sore thumb, this might be the bulb you've been waiting for.

LEDs have been trying to imitate incandescents for years now. First it was light quality, with LEDs of all sorts quickly keying in on a satisfying, yellowy color temperature of 2,700K. Then, we saw bulbs with diodes strategically placed to mimic an incandescent's filament, along with designs that tried to hide the unsightly heat sinks.

Cree's new LED takes another step, ditching the heat sinks altogether in favor of a convection-based build -- Cree dubs it ""4Flow."" As the LED generates heat, it pulls cooler, ambient air into the bulb, venting out the hot stuff in the process.

This allows for a streamlined build that bears the exact same silhouette of a traditional, A19-shaped incandescent light bulb. Gone, however, is the glass used for the original Cree LED's bulb. Instead, the new LED is built entirely out of lightweight plastic (much like the flattened out  Philips SlimStyle LED , which also features a design devoid of heat sinks).

Gone as well is the 10-year warranty, which up until now, Cree has included with all of its consumer bulbs. You'll only get three years of coverage with the 4Flow LED, a cost-cutting decision that Cree tells me it aimed squarely at consumers who simply want the best upfront value at the register. For people who look at lights as more of a long-term investment, the original 60W replacement LED -- and its 10-year warranty -- will remain on sale.

The dichotomy between upfront and long-term value deepens when you compare the new bulb's efficiency specs with those of the original. With a light output of 815 lumens, the new LED is incrementally brighter than the last one, but with a power draw of 11 watts, it's also slightly less efficient.

You're absolutely splitting hairs here, but compared with the original Cree LED, the new model will add, on average, an extra 18 cents to your yearly energy bill. So, while the new bulb is $2 cheaper at the register, the original would be less costly in the long run, making up that $2 difference after about 11 years of usage.

Cree's new LED is dampness-rated for light outdoor use, so it should work fine as a porch light so long as your fixture doesn't leave the bulb completely exposed to the rain. Cree's team also claims that the bulb is safe to use in enclosed fixtures, though if things get too hot, you might shorten the bulb's lifespan somewhat.

During  our initial 60W roundup, the Philips SlimStyle LED left us the most impressed when it came to heat management. From our initial spectrometer readings, the Cree 4Flow LED seems to be right on par with that bulb, which is encouraging, and also not terribly surprising given the similar builds.

As said before, Cree's LED puts out a warm, golden glow typical of most lighting options these days. If you want something with a hotter, whiter color temperature more akin to daylight, you'll be happy to know that Cree offers a 5,000K version of the new bulb for a dollar more. 40w replacement versions are also available at both color temperatures.

Testing the new bulb out in my apartment, I found it to be plenty bright, which backs up what we saw in our tests. Reading a given bulb's lumen output is more complicated than you might think, but we've spent some considerable time building a specialized setup to do just that.

The results for Cree were very good here, with a measured light output of 830 lumens, slightly higher than the stated lumen output of 815, and slightly higher than most of the competition, too. Testing the original Cree out in our integrating sphere, we got a somewhat disappointing reading well below 800 lumens, which suggests that that the difference in brightness between the two might be slightly higher than advertised. With the two lit up side by side, the new LED does indeed look like the brighter bulb, though just barely.

I was less impressed with the new bulb's color rendering score, which Cree advertises as ""greater than 80."" We clocked it right at 80 with a pretty tight margin of error, so if it's any greater than that, it's only fractionally so.

80 is a pretty average score that's largely been par for the course with LEDs over the past year or two, save for premium-priced exceptions like  Cree's own TW Series LED  and the Editors' Choice-winning  GE Reveal BR30 LED floodlight , which both score into the 90s. Recently, however, we've started to see low-cost bulbs like the  Ikea Ledare LED  and the  Utilitech 100W Replacement LED  score in the upper 80s -- I would have liked to have seen Cree follow suit and get out in front of the curve a little bit.

We also made sure to test the new LED's dimming capabilities out. Dimmer switches often produce a small amount of electromagnetic resistance, which can cause bulbs to flicker and buzz as you dial the light up and down. Not the new Cree LED, though. I was only able to hear a buzz when I put my ear against the bulb, and I couldn't detect a significant flicker on any of our dimmer switches (as you can see from the rather boring looking flicker GIF posted above.)

Both the flicker and buzz results are slight improvements over the original Cree LED. While satisfyingly dimmable, that bulb will flicker occasionally on older switches. It also produced a soft, yet audible buzz on each dimmer we tested.

If you're buying a bulb for its dimmability, you'll also want to be sure that it'll dim down low enough for your liking. Again, Cree's new bulb does a good job here, showing a nice dimmable range between 100 percent brightness at maximum settings and 5.6 percent brightness at the bottom of the dial. That's a touch lower than the original, which dims down to 6.8 percent, and lower still than the  Philips SlimStyle LED  and the  GE 60W Replacement LED , neither of which could dim down below 10 percent on any of our switches. Our dimming champ, however, is still the basic, non-flattened  Philips 60W Equivalent LED , which dims down to a very impressive 0.7 percent with zero flicker or buzz.

I've spent a lot of time shopping for light bulbs over the past year, and I've seen plenty of my fellow shoppers squinting in confusion at the new abundance of funny looking options in the lighting aisle. Cree's 4Flow LED is designed with shoppers like those in mind. Sure, it promises the efficiency and longevity of an LED, but it's that incandescent familiarity that's front and center. That seems like a smart way to get more people to feel comfortable giving LEDs a shot.

Cree's new LED is better than the original Cree LED in many ways -- most notably its improved brightness and dimming performance. At $8, it fits right in with the $10 and under crop we've seen emerge, with competitors like the $9  Philips SlimStyle  and the $5  Ikea Ledare . I could make a case for any of them -- but with its high efficiency and its 10-year warranty, the  original Cree LED  still seems like the best long-term value to me."
Philips 100W Equivalent Soft White (2700K) A21 Dimmable LED Light Bulb review:|"

If you're looking to replace a 100W light bulb, you'll find several LED options at prices that aren't nearly as unreasonable as they were just a year or two ago. The current crop, including the Philips 100W Equivalent LED, hovers right around the $20 price point.

Initially priced at $25, Philips' LED has since been marked down a few bucks to $22, which is still slightly more expensive than what you'll see from competitors like GE and Cree. Philips justifies that by claiming an extra 80 lumens' worth of brightness over those two, along with superior dimming capabilities. However, our tests didn't reveal any noticeable difference in either brightness or dimmability. That, along with the fact that Philips offers half the warranty that you'll get with GE or Cree, makes this bulb difficult to recommend.

Philips' 100W Equivalent LED shares the same, flat-topped build of its  smaller siblings  in the 60W and 40W categories, but sets itself apart with a unique design that splits the bulb into three sections separated by deep channels. This helps keep the heat buildup at bay, something that gets especially important when LEDs start putting out this much light.

Even with the emphasis on thermal management, the bulb gets hot to the touch after just a few minutes of use, which isn't unusual for a 100W replacement LED. As such, Philips recommends not using it in an enclosed fixture -- if you do, you'll risk shortening the bulb's lifespan.

That lifespan is rated at 25,000 hours, the same as the other 100W replacement LEDs I tested, with the exception of Utilitech. That lifespan comes out to 22.8 years if the bulb is used for an average of 3 hours per day. Philips warrants the bulb for the first five of those years, while GE and Cree both offer ten-year warranties.

25,000 hours is the longevity benchmark for Energy Star certification -- the Philips 100W Equivalent earned certification over the summer, as did the GE LED I tested. Cree's bulb isn't certified yet, but it meets the criteria -- Cree's team tells me they expect it to be certified in the near future.

Philips claims a light output of 1,680 lumens at a golden hued 2,700 K from a power draw of 19 watts. That makes it good for about 88 lumens per watt -- an impressive number, but not as impressive as GE and Utilitech, which both manage to put out 100 lumens per watt.

Those 1680 lumens are a slight step up from what you'll get with GE, Cree, or any of the other bulbs we tested. With brightness being one of the first things you want from your home lighting, that number would appear to give Philips an edge, albeit a minor one.

However, the engineers at Energy Star test bulbs out for themselves, posting the full specs for every LED they certify online. On Philips' listing, Energy Star rates the bulb at 1,620 lumens -- not 1,680. While an extra 80 lumens is just barely enough to make a noticeable difference, an extra 20 lumens is largely insignificant. We wanted to know which number had it right.

From a simple eye test, the light put out from the Philips 100W Equivalent LED doesn't differ much from its nearest competitors, the Cree and GE 100W replacements. Side by side, the three have nearly identical glows, all of them boasting similarly warm tones. That isn't surprising, given that all three are rated with the same 2,700 K color temperature. When tested, each one erred low, on the yellowy side.

Remember, though, that Philips claims to put out 1,680 lumens to Cree and GE's 1,600. That's a pretty minuscule difference, but it's one that should be noticeable if you're looking closely for it. The problem is that I couldn't notice it.

Testing bulb brightness gets a bit tricky. In addition to measuring color temperature and color rendering scores, our spectrometer can take luminosity readings from a given light -- but those readings are easily skewed by things like viewing angle and distance. To get numbers you can rely on, you need something called an integrating sphere.

An integrating sphere is really just a big, hollow ball with a special, reflective coating on the inside. You place the bulb in the middle with the spectrometer peeking in. With a ""baffle"" between the light and the spectrometer blocking a direct, inaccurate reading, the spectrometer will instead read the luminosity of the light that's bouncing around inside the sphere. If calibrated correctly, this should give you an accurate read of how many lumens a given light source gives off.

Of course, integrating spheres like the ones used by Energy Star and UL are terribly, terribly expensive. So, in lieu of buying one, we built our own.



This wasn't a quick undertaking -- we researched our options for months, speaking with various industry experts to get the best sense of how to pull it off. Finally, led by intrepid technical editors Jared Hannah and Steve Conaway, we started putting the thing together.

The result is a gigantic and hollow styrofoam sphere with a few carefully-applied coats of special, reflective paint on the inside. We're still working to calibrate it as precisely as possible, but have already seen results that look to be within roughly a 1 percent margin of error.

Looking at the 100W replacement LEDs we tested, Philips actually scored the lowest in our sphere, with a score that fell just shy of the 1,620 lumen spec from Energy Star. All four of the other bulbs we tested came in at least slightly higher, a result that lines up with what we see when we compare the bulbs side by side.

That isn't necessarily a bad result -- anything over 1,600 lumens is perfectly adequate at the 100W replacement level. However, it does undercut the notion that Philips' bulb offers extra brightness over the competition.

Something else I took a close look at was how these bulbs performed with dimmer switches. Though many bulbs are listed as ""dimmable,"" some won't dim down as low as others. You also might encounter flicker and buzz due to electromagnetic interference from the dimming mechanism.  When I tested dimmable 60W replacements, the Philips bulb was a clear standout, making it easy to recommend for anyone who likes the light dialed down low.

The 100W version of the Philips LED is equally impressive, with zero flicker, zero buzz, and a minimum lumen output that's slightly  lower than GE or Cree. However, GE and Cree's LEDs still did well. Unlike their 60W counterparts, neither one flickered or buzzed on any of the switches we tested them with. That makes Philips' dimming performance less of an important factor.

The Philips 100W Equivalent LED is a good bulb with solid across-the-board specs. It's bright, it's efficient, it's dimmable, it's omnidirectional, and it comes with a respectable 5-year warranty. At a price of $22, you could certainly do a lot worse.

The problem is that there's some very good competition in this class, including a very efficient GE bulb and a Cree LED that breaks the $20 price barrier. Both of those cheaper options keep up with the Philips LED at every turn, and surpass it in a few key spots, including the ever-important length of warranty. The Philips 100W Equivalent LED is good, but you can do better if you shop around."
Cree 100W Replacement LED review:|"

The Cree 100W Replacement LED is a bigger, brighter version of  the original Cree LED , a highly acclaimed 60W replacement that made its debut back at the start of 2013. With the 100W version, Cree looks to be following the same formula: familiar-looking light, an industry-leading 10-year warranty, and an appealing price point.

Specifically, that price sits just a few cents below $20, which is certainly enticing when you consider that 100W replacement LEDs were selling for $50 or more just a few years ago. That said, Cree isn't the only LED maker that's recently taken big steps forward. For example,  GE's 100W replacement  costs just a dollar more, and offers that same decade-long warranty along with a more efficient build. Cree's 100W Replacement LED is an excellent bulb -- but it's not your only legitimate option in this class. Put it at the top of your list it if you use dimmer switches, or might need to use it outside, but don't rule out GE, especially if efficiency is your top priority.

Cree's 100W LED looks a lot like the 40W and 60W replacements that came before it, albeit with a bigger bulb and a larger collar of heat sinks around the neck. This gives it some extra bulk compared to competitors like GE's 100W replacement -- that bulb has elongated, fin-like heat sinks, which makes for a narrower design.

Extra girth aside, Cree's LED is still a relative lightweight, weighing less than 6 ounces. The  Sylvania 100W Replacement Ultra LED , for instance, weighs more than twice as much.

Cree's LED puts out 1,600 lumens from a power draw of 18 watts. That's very good, putting its efficiency just shy of 90 lumens per watt. Still, both GE and Utilitech do even better, with designs that put out 100 lumens per watt.

As for color temperature, Cree's bulb aims for the same, yellow-toned 2,700 K as most of the competition. If you want something hotter and whiter, Cree offers a 5,000 K version of the bulb for a dollar more. That's a nice option you won't find with every brand.

Like most LEDs, Cree claims that its bulb will last 25,000 hours -- well over 20 years if used for an average of three hours per day. Couple that with the 10-year warranty and the fact that the bulb will only add a little over $2 per year to your energy bill, and the long term value starts looking awfully good.

The color rendering score of 80, on the other hand, is a little less impressive. 80 isn't a bad score per se, but it isn't a standout, either. We've seen affordable competitors from brands such as  Utilitech  and even  Ikea  score several points higher, making for a noticeable uptick in accurate color quality.

Outside of the 100W class, we've seen bulbs push that CRI score up even higher.  Cree's own TW Series LED  does even better, scoring up into the 90s, as does  the Editors' Choice-winning GE Reveal LED floodlight  and other bulbs from the GE Reveal line. Moving forward, it'll be interesting to see if any of the major manufacturers decide to release a 100W equivalent with those sorts of color-rendering specs, as there definitely seems to be room for such a product.

For most practical purposes, I think Cree's 100W replacement would be an excellent pick. I was pleased with both the brightness and light quality, and appreciated the even, omnidirectional light output.

That isn't something you'll find with every bulb in this class. For instance, compare Cree with the bulbs we tested from Sylvania and Utilitech. Those each only offer about 180 degrees of focused directionality, which means that you'll get plenty of light moving up and out from the bulb, but probably not as much downward light as you'd hope for. This isn't a problem for something like a recessed overhead light, which only needs to shine light in one direction, but if you're hoping to use your bulb in a reading lamp, you'll be disappointed if it isn't omnidirectional.

Cree's bulb is dampness rated, which means it'll work outdoors, at least to a limited extent. For something uncovered that'll be directly exposed to the elements, you'll probably want to splurge on something that's wetness rated, a step up from dampness that tells you a bulb can handle getting rained on.  Cree's PAR38 LED  is a good example of such a bulb.

Another practical consideration is dimmer compatibility. Many of today's LED offerings, including bulbs from Cree, claim to be dimmable and will, in fact, dim up and down on a variety of dimmer switches both old and new. However, some will dim smoothly, while others will flicker and buzz as you dial the light up and down. With no rating system beyond ""dimmable"" and ""non-dimmable,"" it can be next to impossible for consumers to be certain that the bulb they're buying into will work well in their homes.

Fortunately, we make sure to test each bulb we review on our dimming rig, which includes dimmer switches from a variety of brands, including an outdated rotary dial intended for incandescents only. In these tests, Cree did great. Even with the older model, it dimmed down smoothly, and hardly flickered at all. I heard a soft buzz if I put my ear right up next to the bulb, but that was it.

In sum, Cree's 100W Replacement LED seems like it'd be a good fit for a wide variety of household lighting scenarios -- certainly more so than a non-omnidirectional bulb, or one that isn't dimmable. My only hesitation would be using it in an enclosed fixture. With the extra diodes, the bulb puts out extra heat (hence the extra large heat sinks). Since built-up, non-dispersed heat will affect LED longevity, I'm not sure that I'd feel confident about sealing this bulb up inside an enclosed setting (or any 100W replacement LED, for that matter). For situations like that, I'd probably stick with a CFL or a halogen.

At $20, Cree's 100W Replacement LED is a very solid value, but it isn't in a class by itself. The  GE 100W Replacement LED  boasts a comparable level of satisfying performance, along with an uptick in efficiency. It costs an extra dollar, but you'll earn that dollar back in energy savings within a few years.

Those two bulbs currently sit at the front of the 100W pack, offering the most LED bang for your buck. Both are bright, efficient, dimmable, omnidirectional, and backed up by strong warranties. GE's bulb sells at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, while you'll find Cree's LED lineup exclusively at Home Depot. I say take your pick and buy in with confidence either way."
Sylvania 100W Replacement Ultra LED review:|"

Two years ago, Sylvania was one of the first lighting manufacturers to bring a 100W replacement LED to market. The price? A mere $50.

Since then, the field has expanded, and prices have fallen significantly. Case in point: Sylvania's newest take on the 100W replacement LED, which retails at Lowe's for a much more reasonable $22. With the bulb's 1,600 lumen rating, you're getting a clear bump in brightness, but the 19W power draw is higher than I'd like, making it a less efficient choice than some of its competitors -- including bulbs that cost less. Some of those cheaper competitors also offer longer warranties, higher color rendering scores, and better compatibility with dimmers. Given all of that, I say stick with those alternatives, and pass on what Sylvania is offering.

Like most 100W replacement LEDs, Sylvania's bulb is a bit bulky, sporting an A21 shape (a step up in size from the traditional A19 shape you'll find with the majority of 60W bulbs). It's heavy, too, weighing in at 11.45 ounces.

That's heavier than any other 100W bulb we've tested -- more than twice as heavy as the GE Energy Smart 100W Replacement LED, the lightest bulb in this class. While not inherently problematic (unless you're buying a bulb for a weight-sensitive fixture), the extra bulk does perhaps speak to a design that's less economical than competitors that manage to do more with less.

All the same, Sylvania puts that hefty hardware to work, cranking out a sufficient 1,600 lumens of yellowy, 2,700 K light from a stated power draw of 19 watts. That's obviously quite efficient when compared with a 100W incandescent, but compared with competing LEDs, it's actually a bit underwhelming. Cree, GE, and Utilitech will all get you those same 1,600 lumens from a lower wattage. As for Philips, its 100W replacement offers a slightly higher 1,680 lumens from the same wattage as Sylvania.

Some of Sylvania's other specs fare a little better against the competition. For instance, we clocked the bulb's color rendering score at 83 out of 100, making it slightly better at accurate, vivid color illumination than all but one other 100W replacement (though it's worth noting that the Utilitech bulb that beat it costs $5 less).

The Sylvania LED promises the same 25,000-hour lifespan as most LEDs currently on the market, making it good for over twenty years if you're using it an average of three hours per day. Sylvania backs that longevity claim up with a warranty of five years -- plenty long enough for you to recoup the cost of the bulb in energy savings (and then some), but not as long as you'll get with Cree or GE, which both offer ten-year warranties on their 100W replacement LEDs. And again, both of those competitors cost less.

The big takeaway from all of these specs and figures is that there's nothing the Sylvania 100W replacement LED really excels at. It's the solid-C student of its class -- not flunking out, but not making the honor roll any time soon, either.

Taking Sylvania's LED out of our spectrometer rig and moving it to a more practical setting, I found the light perfectly pleasant and satisfyingly bright -- certainly a noticeable step up from what you'd expect with a 60W-level bulb, which would put out closer to 800 lumens.

However, the bulb isn't ideal for all home settings. With a non-omnidirectional design that doesn't cast very much downward light, you won't want to use it in a bedside table lamp, for instance. Omnidirectional bulbs like the Cree 100W Replacement LED (pictured above on the right) offer a much greater deal of flexibility with regards to where you can use them.

Though it doesn't say so anywhere on the packaging, Sylvania's LED is dimmable down to 10 percent of its maximum brightness. We tested it out on our dimming rig with Lutron and Leviton dimmer switches designed to work with LEDs, as well as an older triac rotary dial designed for incandescents only.

Sylvania's bulb dimmed successfully on all three, though it wasn't quite as smooth or flicker-free as some of the other bulbs I tested. The flicker was most visible at the lowest settings, although in fairness, it wasn't nearly as bad as what I saw with the  Utilitech 100W Equivalent LED . Regardless, if you're buying a bulb to use with a dimmer switch, you can do a lot better than both of them.

For $22, Sylvania's 100W Replacement Ultra LED isn't a bad bulb, and the price isn't unreasonable. Factoring in the long-term energy savings, it'd pay for itself in a little over two years -- well before the five-year warranty is expired.

Still, other 100W replacements will do the job just as well -- better, actually -- and they'll cost a little less. Philips' equally priced 100W replacement offers a slight uptick in brightness and efficiency, along with better dimming performance. Cree's well-rounded LED offers twice the warranty, as does the notably more efficient 100W replacement from GE -- both of those cost a few bucks less. Utilitech's 100W replacement, found next to Sylvania on the shelf at Lowe's, is even more of a bargain at just $17.

Sylvania doesn't hold a distinct edge over any of those bulbs, and that makes it a tough LED to recommend, if not an impossible one."
GE 16W LED (100W Replacement) review:|"

Nearly two years ago, rising efficiency standards  spelled the end of the 100W incandescent light bulb. Thankfully, your options have been steadily expanding ever since, with a full crop of new LEDs promising that same level of brightness from a substantially smaller power draw.

Of these new bulbs, the GE 100W Replacement LED is one of the best. Drawing just 16 watts to put out a very bright 1,600 lumens, GE's dimmable, omnidirectional bulb ranks as one of the most efficient we've ever tested. Switch over from an incandescent, and it'll pay for itself in about two years -- a full eight years before the 10-year warranty expires. Its retail price of $21 sits above worthy competitors from  Cree  and  Utilitech , but considering just how much GE gets right with this bulb, I think it's well worth it.

GE didn't put much effort into hiding the hardware on its 100W replacement LED. Rather, this bulb embraces a heat sink-centric design, with long, vertical fins around the bulb which help to disperse the heat, and which also create the illusion of a traditionally-shaped light.

Obviously, this makes for an LED that's rather conspicuous in appearance, but my real concern was whether or not those fins would affect the light output. With the bulb hidden under a lamp shade, I was happy to find that they didn't -- the light output was perfectly even and omnidirectional, with no fin-shaped dim spots to speak of.

Measuring its light output, GE says its bulb puts out 1,600 lumens' worth of illumination at a warm-toned 2,700 K. Under the scrutiny of our spectrometer, that color temperature rang in closer to 2,600 K -- lower and more yellowy than any other 100W replacement we tested.

That isn't necessarily a bad thing, and may even be a good thing if you prefer warm tones in your home. For my tastes, I like a more golden glow from my lights, and GE's bulb certainly fits that bill. If you're hoping for a more neutral daylight tone, though, you'll need to look elsewhere.

The bulb's most impressive spec is that it only consumes 16 watts of electricity, efficient enough to put out 100 lumens per watt. That ties it with Utilitech's bulb, making the two of them the most efficient 100W replacements we tested. Nothing else was able to get above 90 lumens per watt.

With that power draw, GE's bulb would add less than $2 to your energy bill each year, assuming you're paying 11 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) and using it an average of 3 hours per day. Under the same parameters, a 100W incandescent would cost more than $12 per year, assuming it lasted that long (incandescents are typically rated to last about 1,000 hours). Like other Energy Star-certified LEDs, the GE 100W Replacement LED is rated to last 25,000 hours -- well over 20 years.

GE backs its longevity claims up with a 10-year warranty, the same warranty that Cree offers for its bulbs. That's as long a warranty as you'll find on a brand-name light bulb, and an exceptional deal for skeptics who aren't sold on LED value just yet.

As said before, the GE 100W Replacement LED looks good beneath a lampshade. With its omnidirectional light output, you can expect an even amount of brightness in all directions. This includes downward light, which gets especially important when you're sitting under a lamp to read a book.

Not all of the bulbs that we tested can claim such satisfying performance. Both Sylvania and Utilitech's 100W replacement LEDs are non-omnidirectional, offering only 180 degrees of focused light output. That's fine for overhead, recessed lighting setups, but less ideal for that reading lamp I mentioned.

Cree and Philips' 100W replacements fared better, both of them boasting the same omnidirectional light output as you'll get with GE. While neither one is quite as efficient as GE, Philips claims an extra 80 lumens' worth of brightness, while Cree costs a buck less.

I do wish that GE offered a slightly higher  color rendering score. Though its CRI score of 81 is perfectly adequate for an LED (and a point higher than what you'll get with Philips or Cree), GE's 100W Replacement LED doesn't come anywhere close to the color rendering capabilities of the GE Reveal line, including the  Editors' Choice-winning GE Reveal BR30 LED . Those bulbs score up into the 90s by filtering out yellow tones -- this does wonders to improve contrast, whiten whites, and make colors look vivid and more accurate.

A GE Reveal-branded 100W Replacement LED would make for an especially nice addition to GE's lighting lineup, as no bulb in this class wowed us with its color rendering capabilities. The closest we saw was the Utilitech 100W Replacement LED, which scored an 85 in front of our spectrometer. That's an impressive result considering that Utilitech's LED was the least expensive one that we tested, but not impressive enough to recommend Utilitech, given that bulb's shorter warranty and non-omnidirectional design.

Another advantage GE has over Utilitech is dimmability.  Many bulbs will flicker and buzz when you use them with in-wall dimmer switches, and some, like the Utilitech bulb we tested, will barely work at all.

Not the GE LED, though. The light dimmed smoothly up and down on all of the switches we tested it with, never producing an audible buzz. The only time we detected any sort of flicker was with the light dialed down to the lowest settings, and as flickers go, it was barely noticeable.

It wasn't too long ago that LED bulbs were selling for $50 or even $100, so the fact that we have a very healthy crop of 100W replacement LEDs selling for right around $20 is a clear sign of the times. Moving forward, I expect LED quality to continue to improve even as the prices continue to creep downward, but it's still a good time to buy in if you've been holding out.

GE's 100W Replacement LED is about as well-rounded a light as we've tested, and at $21, I think it's fairly priced, too. Cree's bulb costs a dollar less, but it isn't quite as efficient. Utilitech's bulb is cheaper still, but it doesn't have as good a warranty, and it isn't dimmer-friendly, either. With GE, you're getting the complete package -- and for a product designed to last decades, I think the complete package is what you want."
A light switch wherever you need one|"

Device-maker Avi-on thinks its Bluetooth LE-powered $40 Avi-On Movable Light Switch is the answer to the problem of the overcomplicated smart home.

There's a certain logic in using Bluetooth as a basis for building out a smart home. Many Android phones, and any iPhone from the 4S onward can talk directly to a switch or a plug using Bluetooth LE, so many consumers already have the necessary control point. You don't have to worry about losing control of your Bluetooth devices when the internet goes down. Using Bluetooth low energy (aka Bluetooth LE) also lets certain devices run on batteries, rather than requiring a power cable or a direct in-wall wire connection.

That low power draw in particular gives the Movable Light Switch some appeal. Because it runs on batteries, it will work anywhere, as long as it's in range of Avi-on's coming Bluetooth light bulbs.

The switch itself is a slider that lets you dim the lights as well as turn them on and off directly. You fix it to the wall using an included adhesive strip, or you can screw it in directly over an existing light switch mounting plate.

Along with the switch, Avi-on also has an app that lets you drive the system from any Bluetooth LE-equipped Android or iOS device. The controls here all sound pretty typical, you get on/off, dimming, scheduling, and grouping capability. Thanks to a licensing deal with GE, we'll also see an assortment of GE-branded Avi-on compatible Bluetooth switches and plugs hit the market which will also work with the Avi-on app.

While a Bluetooth-based smart home sounds simple, one downside is that you can't control it when you're away from home unless you use some kind of Internet-bridging device. Avi-on says it will sell its own bridge device. It hasn't firmed up any partnerships with third-party hub manufacturers yet, but it's easy to imagine  SmartThings , the  Wink Hub , or  Revolv  adding Avi-on compatibility.

You should also consider Belkin's Wi-Fi-based WeMo connected device family if you want both local and remote smart-home control and you also want to remain hub-free. Belkin's competing WeMo Light Switch needs a direct connection to your in-wall wiring, so it doesn't have the same location flexibility as the Avi-on switch, but you also don't need a separate device to control it or most other WeMo products remotely.

Avi-on is bringing its switch, light bulbs, and other devices to market via a self-run crowd-funding campaign. It expects to sell the first round of products in the spring or summer of 2015."
Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight review:|"

The first product from Leeo, the $100 Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight, starts with the cornerstone of meaningful connected tech: safety. In addition to providing color-changing light to illuminate darkened hallways, Leeo's device connects to your Wi-Fi network and listens for the specific frequencies of smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms. When it picks up an alarm, it will send an alert to your smartphone.

There's something earnest and charming about this product. Not the least of which is the fact that while its nightlight keeps your children safe from the imagined fears of the night, its alerts can help protect them from real-world dangers. It's a smart combination. The app suffers from a few bugs, however, and in the event of an emergency, the alerts won't do much to help you figure out what's actually going on. Thus, despite its well-intentioned charm, for $100 you're better off with the  Nest Protect .

Plug in the Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight and you'll immediately be greeted by a soft white glow. Pull up the app with your iOS device and connect the light to your Wi-Fi router via your phone's Bluetooth. Leeo recommends an iPhone instead of an iPad so you can contact emergency services directly from an alert, but you can access the app from either. An Android app is planned, but no release date has yet been confirmed.

The nightlight itself has a white circular front with an outer ring you can use to adjust the brightness. The light forms another ring just behind the front circle, and the back juts out mildly to the plug, which fits into a single outlet without blocking the other. The illumination kicks off the wall, providing a reflected illumination that won't hurt your eyes in the darkness.

Once connected, you'll enter your address into the app, then be prompted to test your smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector to make sure the nightlight is within range to hear them. Leeo recommends positioning their device in the hallway for the widest coverage disrupted by the least amount of walls and doors. They also recommend staying within 75 feet of your alarms.

The light will blink white during the process, then blue once it connects to keep you apprised of your progress. In all, the setup was as simple as I've experienced with a smart home product. Download the app, plug in the light, enter your Wi-Fi info and your address. I stated earlier that part of Leeo's mission is to make technology accessible. Mission accomplished.

My grandma could get this nightlight working, as long as I showed her how to unlock my iPhone. You can even unplug it and move it to a different outlet with no additional steps, as long as the new location is in range of the same router.

From the app, you can see the temperature and humidity of the nightlight's location, play with its color and brightness, and customize alerts for its sound sensors as well as its temperature and humidity sensors. The Smart Alert Nightlight can also detect ambient light, so you can have it turn on only when it's dark.

The Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight is available now on Leeo's website. It costs $100. The iOS app is free and the only way to interact with the nightlight for the time being. For now, it's only available in the US, but a Leeo representative assured me the company is working with distributors to get it to other countries.

The light itself can be tuned to a wide-variety of colors. Leeo claims there are over 16 million options. Functionally, it certainly doesn't feel like that, but the mechanic lets you pick your specific shade placing your finger on a color spectrum. Given the  color changing smart LEDs  out there, the mechanic isn't ground-breaking, but it works well enough.

The size of the icon controlled by your finger makes it hard to land on an exact color temperature, so the estimate of 16 million certainly seems like an exaggeration, but anyone other than lighting experts would be hard pressed to care. I enjoyed the feature overall, and can imagine it would be a hit with a child counting on his or her favorite color to help keep the boogeyman away. Picking the color at bedtime could make a fun tradition. And because this nightlight is connected, it'd be a tradition you could keep even when away on business.

The occasional lag might put a damper on the activity, though. Sometimes, the Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight sleeps on the job. You'll pull up the app and change the color to no effect. Continuing to send it signals by shifting the icon usually pulls it out of its reverie within 15 to 30 seconds, then it'll be pretty responsive, with no more than a second or two delay between your input and its response.

Still, the initial wake up call annoyed me, and the one time I changed a setting without first making sure the nightlight was ready to respond, it didn't take, despite the app confirming the change. Even when it's running, you'll occasionally encounter a longer hiccup in color changing, especially when fine-tuning colors.

Having to coax an occasionally grumpy, occasionally sleepy app to do what I want showed me the software needs a bit of work. The dimming also proved a bit limited, as small shifts didn't produce any discernible results. I had to move a significant distance on the brightness scale to see any difference, though I liked the fact that you can control the brightness manually by twisting the outer ring of the light.

The light itself illuminates the room effectively and pleasantly, and you can always get the color you want, eventually. The app issues dampen it, but the nightlight itself has plenty of charm.

Fortunately, the sensors used for the smart alert system don't suffer from the same sleepiness as the nightlight. Leeo's device proved consistently responsive when I sounded the smoke alarm.

I had some trouble when first testing the system. I plugged the nightlight into our climate-controlled washing machine test room to test temperature and humidity fluctuations. Temperature proved accurate to a degree, but the humidity reading disappointed me. It was consistently 5-10 percent higher than my calibrated readings.

It also continually failed to recognize the smoke detector I triggered when it was in the test chamber. I moved around, trying various distances, and despite sounding the alarm long enough to cause my eardrums to request a leave of absence, I couldn't get a response from the nightlight.

When I moved it to our more home-like, less echo-inducing kitchen, the alarm detection started working like a charm. After establishing what the smoke detector sounded like via the setup menu, I even moved it back to the lab space and got it to work there.

The Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight is programmed to recognize specific frequencies. Carbon monoxide and smoke detectors have industry regulated pitches that set their sirens apart. This nightlight looks for that specific sound, a feature I like since it's not just listening for high-pitched screeching or loud noises.

Our echoing warehouse probably distorted that frequency. It eventually picked up the sound once it heard it under normal circumstances, despite any distortion in the warehouse.

Once the alarm sounds, the nightlight will start flashing red and you'll get a push notification sent to your iOS device. If you don't respond to that, you'll get an automated call to your iPhone or another phone of your choosing. If you still don't respond, after two tries, the system will call a designated emergency contact.

Respond at any point, and you'll hear a 5-second recorded clip. The system will ask you if this is a false alarm, or if it warrants a 911 call. The system won't reach out for you, but can prompt you with the number for emergency services in the location of your home instead of your location if you're somewhere remote.

It's not professional monitoring by any means, but these alerts and phone calls all come free of any sort of monthly service charge. Since it's not a smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector itself, it also reveals its usefulness as a smart device. If you're home, you'll inevitably hear the alarm. The Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight is designed to listen for you when you're not home, so you can smarten up ordinary smoke detectors.

You'll also get push notifications if the temperature or humidity falls outside of the threshold you've set. The unique multi-tier alert system doesn't apply, which seems fair, since those readings function as warnings more than alarms.

I like the fact that you can designate an emergency contact, and the fact that the system gives you the right locale for your 911 call. That said, these alerts also reveal Leeo's biggest drawback.

The device's sensor picks up the frequency of the alarm well, but it isn't great at recording sound. I thought the 5-second playback provided by the system would be useful. In practice, unfortunately, it really wasn't. The idea is to simply determine you are indeed hearing an alarm, or if the system was misled by a stray noise that happened to have a similar pitch. On the app, you can hear just enough to verify this, but it's distinctly quiet and impossible to discern anything more subtle.

Over the phone, the sound came across completely garbled. I couldn't tell what I was hearing. If you miss the push notification and end up with a phone call, you'll be left in the dark regarding what's actually happening in your home.

Even if you respond via the app, 5 seconds of beeping won't be much more illuminating. At a time when I would be imagining the worst, I may have enough information to reach out for help, but I'd want nothing more than to find out for sure what was wrong. Meaning, at the moment of safety that this device was designed for, I'd want nothing more than a device with greater capability.

To top it off, the Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight doesn't have a battery backup. If the power goes out before the alarm goes off, you'll be left completely in the dark. A longer, higher quality recording or an ability to listen to what's happening via a live feed would go a long way toward cementing this as a worthwhile product.

If you do get an alert before the power fails, it's certainly preferable to know something could be wrong than to not realize something's up when you might have helped mitigate the damage in the case of an actual emergency. Thus, if there were no other options, I could recommend this product as a limited but useful smart device.

However, it's outdone in almost every way by the Nest Protect, which detects smoke and carbon monoxide on its own, and can give you detailed descriptions of what's wrong via its app. The Nest Protect also has a battery backup and a motion-sensing nightlight. It can work in conjunction with the  Nest Learning Thermostat  and other smart home devices too, acting as an extended sensor, among other things. The kicker: it also costs $100.

I liked the Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight, and look forward to seeing more advanced versions in the future. Leeo's first product already has a strong base from which to build. The design is simple and pleasant. Changing the colors was fun, if occasionally glitchy. And I was charmed by the combination of the simple reassurance provided by a light in the darkness with the advanced technology needed to watch for something more serious.

Even the frequency-specific sensors and tiers of alerts seem well thought-out. But without a more refined app and more capability to investigate when something does go wrong, the $100 price tag makes little sense. Especially given that you can get the much more capable  Nest Protect  for the same amount. So yes, I liked it, but until it gets a price drop or some significant upgrades, I can't recommend it."
Utilitech 16W (100W Equivalent) Warm White LED review:|"

Ask people what they want from their light bulbs, and you're likely to hear a rather obvious answer: brightness. 60W bulbs (and  60W replacements) are fine for most purposes, but if you're looking for something extra bright, you'll probably want to push it to 100W. With LEDs in particular, that typically means paying a premium.

Fortunately, that premium has been shrinking steadily over the past year or so, with prices falling from $40 or $50 per bulb down to less than $20 in some cases. Utilitech's 100W equivalent LED is one such bulb, costing just $17 at your neighborhood Lowe's. With over 1600 lumens from roughly one-fifth the power draw of its incandescent predecessors, Utilitech's affordable LED offers both brightness and efficiency -- but it isn't as well-rounded as some of its competitors. For basic needs, it'll do a fine job, but competitors that cost a few dollars more might actually be the better deal.

Utilitech's 100W Equivalent LED isn't inconspicuous to look at. At just under 8 ounces, it's far heavier than its incandescent counterparts and even some other comparable LEDs. Its white, plastic body is lined with long, narrow fins, creating channels that help disperse heat.

Utilitech promises a light output of 1600 lumens, which is right where it should be as a replacement for a 100W incandescent. Unlike that incandescent, though, Utilitech gets you there with a stated power draw of just 16 watts. That gives it a very impressive efficiency rating of 100 lumens per watt, tying it with GE's latest 100W replacement LED, which also puts out 1600 lumens from 16W.

That level of efficiency adds up to noticeable energy savings. Assuming you're paying 11 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), a 100W incandescent's power draw would cost you about $12 per year to run for 3 hours per day. Switch to the Utilitech LED, and that number falls below $2. In less than two years, you'd have covered the cost of the bulb and would continue saving money for the rest of its lifespan.

That lifespan is clocked at 18,000 hours, or about 16.4 years at those same 3 hours per day. That's certainly a great deal more than you can expect from an incandescent, a halogen, or a compact fluorescent (CFL), but it falls a bit short of other LEDs, the majority of which have settled on 25,000 hours as the average lifespan.

The Utilitech LED puts out its light at a stated color temperature of 3,000 K -- a slightly hotter, slightly less yellow shade than you'll find with most LEDs, which aim for 2,700 K. When we turned the bulb on in front of our spectrometer, we measured its color temperature at 2,999 K, which is as spot-on a result as any bulb we've ever tested.

Our spectrometer can also shed some light on a bulb's color-rendering capabilities, measured on a 1 to 100 scale. Bulbs with higher scores  will do a better job at making colors look accurate and vivid. Most household LEDs score right around 80, which is decent enough, yet unspectacular.

In the Utilitech LED's case, that score came out to 85. While still not as good of a number as you'll see from a bulb like the  Cree TW Series LED  or  the Editors' Choice-winning GE Reveal LED floodlight , it's still a good result, and a better one than we saw from any other 100W replacement LED.

One last number worth keeping in mind: the warranty. With Utilitech, you'll get two years of coverage, which falls well short of the five years offered by Sylvania and Philips, and shorter still of GE and Cree, which each offer 10-year warranties. While all four of those competitors cost more than Utilitech, the additional years of coverage might alone be well worth the extra expense -- especially if you're left skeptical by LED longevity claims.

Something else to consider is dimmability. The Utilitech LED is explicitly non-dimmable, saying so right on the packaging. We didn't let that stop us from trying it out on our dimming rig though. The bulb actually dims up and down to an extent, but dial it down to a low setting, and it'll begin strobing violently. That might come in handy if you're running a haunted house -- for normal use scenarios, not so much.

One last concern is directionality. Competitors like the Cree 100W Replacement LED offer omnidirectional light output, meaning that the light shines out in all directions. The hemispherical Utilitech LED, however, only promises 180 degrees worth of light output, meaning the light shines brightly up and out from the bulb, but far less so at downward angles. For something like a bedside reading lamp, where downward lighting is key, this wouldn't be ideal at all.

At $17, Utilitech's 100W Equivalent LED is a good bargain bulb, and one that's efficient enough to cover its own cost in energy savings within two years if you're upgrading from an incandescent. It offered a satisfyingly bright light output, along with the highest color rendering score of any 100W bulb we've tested. For basic household lighting scenarios that require a little extra oomph, I think it'd do the job nicely.

Still, the limited directionality of the design, the relatively short warranty, and the lack of dimmer compatibility all give me pause. While none of those concerns are complete deal breakers, they do stop me from recommending Utilitech outright. With this crop of bulbs, you get what you pay for, and paying a little extra for something more well-rounded probably makes sense, especially given that it's a purchase you'll be living with day in and day out for the foreseeable future."
Ubi wants to bring Siri-style automation to your smart home|"



Toronto-based startup United Computer Intelligence Corporation (UCIC) has been kicking around the concept of Ubi, ""the ubiquitous computer,"" for quite some time. Like Ivee Sleek, Ubi is a voice-activated smart home gadget that's supposed to help you automate your life hands-free. And starting today, you can buy one for $299 on Theubi.com.

Ubi has that same square-with-rounded-edges shape as the  Nest Protect  and the  Rachio Iro . It's powered by a wall adapter and connects to your local Wi-Fi so you can interact with your smart home whenever you want, Siri-style. Ivee Sleek and other voice-control smart-home products like the  Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat with Voice Control  haven't blown us away, but that doesn't mean we wouldn't welcome one that works well, offers more than a few commands and keeps to a reasonable price point.

On that note, $299 definitely seems steep, but UCIC has secured partnerships with some pretty major smart-home players, including SmartThings and Belkin WeMo. Since Ubi integrates with these brands, you should be able to lock your front door, adjust your thermostat, turn on your lights and even get security-related alerts, depending on the specific connected devices you have at home. These third-party integrations might just make Ubi marketable, even with its hefty price tag.

The Ubi CC app, currently only available on Android devices, acts as an extension of this voice-controlled functionality. According to UCIC, you will be able to ask Ubi to send a text, set a calendar reminder, read an email or play your favorite song -- all on the go. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out, given Apple's plan to bring Siri (the real Siri) to its iOS 8 HomeKit platform.

We've asked for a review unit and hope to be back soon with more details on UCIC's ""ubiquitous computer."""
August Smart Lock review:|"

Editor's note, Feb. 13, 2015: This review has been updated to account for the August Connect WiFi accessory.

The August Smart Lock nails most of the things I'd want in a connected door lock. It's easy to install. It looks good (yes, despite its size) and the August app (in iOS, at least) gives you the right balance between flexibility and keeping things safe and simple. The fact that it works with your existing deadbolt is also a plus.

The $250 asking price (international availability pending) puts August on the more expensive end of the smart-lock spectrum. The August Smart Lock also suffers from the same limitations as other connected locks. Because it's a Bluetooth-only device, controlling the lock with your phone when you're out of range requires either a compatible third-party hub or August's new $50 Connect accessory that you'll need to buy separately. Bluetooth also means you'll suffer from minor but still annoying lag when you first open the app to interact with the Smart Lock.

If the lag means you won't likely swap your physical key out for the August and a connected smartphone, this lock still gets enough things right that it's become our new favorite automated door control. We will certainly see more connected locks come to market over the next few years. This is the one they need to beat.

We've reviewed a  handful smart locks , and all of them but August involve wholesale replacement of your lock hardware. In the case of the August Smart Lock, it's designed to use your existing deadbolt and keyset, replacing only the thumbturn on the inside face of your door.

For the most part the complete lock sets have been fine, but  we ran into trouble when we reviewed the  Kwikset Kevo . The Bluetooth-based functions of that lock work well enough, but the deadbolt is not as secure as the company claimed. As we said in our review last year, the Kevo's Bluetooth tech is impressive, but the product as a whole suffers since you can't separate it from the lock hardware.

Because the August is a retrofit product, the quality of the deadbolt is up to you. As long as your existing lock uses one of the 100 or so compatible deadbolts on this list, you can add the August lock to it.

Read the directions with your August lock to make sure you match up the various pieces of mounting hardware with your existing deadbolt, but overall installation is simple and should only take about 15 minutes.

Essentially, you take off the thumbturn, and use your lock's existing screws to attach the August mounting plate and adapter to your door. To hang the August lock itself on the mounting plate, you lift up two little ""wings"" on each side of the lock, situate the lock on the plate, and the push the wings down to hold the lock in place.

In theory this installation should be simple, and if you align everything correctly it will be. If it doesn't all slide together easiler, you'll be tempted to push the lock in hard and force the wings down if you don't get a perfect fit at first. Don't. I broke one August by turning it too hard. If it doesn't latch on to the plate easily, start over.

Once you install the lock, or likely even after you take it out of the box, you'll notice that it's big. At almost 2.25 inches thick and 3.25 inches across, it's smaller than the boxy control units that come with most of the other smart locks we've seen, but between its size and its unique shape, August gives a bulky first impression.

I got used to its looks after a few days. There's a certain Duplo-inflected charm to its stubby, over-sized appearance. The silver case and the line pattern etched into the finish also look good (black, red, and ""champagne gold"" options also available). I also like that the metal ring around the lock functions as a mechanical turn for the deadbolt. It's crucial that any smart lock performs its basic lock/unlock functions regardless of whether it has power. August's approach does that well.

You use four included AA batteries to power the August. To connect it to your phone, download the August app, turn on Bluetooth, and follow the software walkthrough. It works with iOS 7-plus-based devices from the iPhone 4S forward, and with any Android 4.4 or greater-based device that also has low-power Bluetooth. The only difference between the two versions is that Android lacks a handy auto-unlock feature. August tells us it's working on adding it to Android in a future update.

During set up you'll create an account and manage a ""Keychain"" designed to handle multiple locks. You can name each lock, and if your account is dubbed the ""Owner,"" you can manage all of the settings and distribute e-keys to anyone with a compatible smartphone or tablet.

August carves out an advantage for itself with its free, unlimited e-key distribution policy. Kwikset and other smart-lock makers charge you per key once you go past a certain allotment. That approach has always felt stingy, and I'm glad to see August expose it as such.

As with those other locks, you can also customize the parameters for each key you send out. You can set them for permanent access, allow them to work only on a certain schedule or set them to expire after a certain time. You can also revoke any of the keys, or upgrade a guest user to owner status instantly. Being an owner lets a user distribute keys of their own and grants geofencing-based auto-unlocking.

The auto-unlocking is one of the August Smart Lock's best features. For now it's only available to iOS users, but August says it hopes to turn it on for Android users by the end of the year.

With the auto-unlock feature enabled, the August lock will open automatically once you leave and then come back within 100 yards. I found this feature almost flawless. It will only work once you've traveled a sufficient distance away from your door. Every time I drove away from my house, or walked a significant distance and came back, auto-unlock worked exactly as expected.

The one time auto-lock failed was during the video shoot for this review, when I walked to what I thought was just past the 100-yard mark and then back again. My hunch is that you need to put more than 100 yards between yourself and the door for it to work. I'd like to test this further when I have the chance, but this was a minor hiccup given that the lock opened as expected every time I got home from work or after walking the dog.

Yes, you can use the lock in conjunction with the app and tap the virtual button in the app to lock and unlock the door. The lag that comes with Bluetooth, though, means that every time you open the August app it will pause for a few seconds while it finds the lock. After taking out your phone, opening the app, and waiting for the Bluetooth signal, you've lost any speed advantage over using a traditional key.

If you'd rather the lock open only when you're in close proximity to it, you might get your wish eventually. August says it's waiting to generate enough real world user data to see if wants to set a shorter auto-unlock distance or whether it will let you customize the distance yourself. The concern is that if works over too short a distance, you might unwittingly open the lock while you're still at home, causing a potential safety issue.

I don't blame August for acting cautiously here, although I can see how city apartment dwellers or others who may regularly leave their homes but don't travel far might want to adjust the distance. Consider accordingly before you make a purchase.

The other built-in automated feature is the Everlock setting, which will tell August to lock itself automatically 30 seconds after you've opened it. This feature also worked reliably, and it even works when your phone is turned off. August says it will let you customize the timing of this feature soon via software update.

To control the August outside of Bluetooth range, you'll need to bridge the device to your home WiFi network. Right now the only way to do that is via the company's new Connect WiFi accessory.

The August Connect plugs directly into a power outlet, and it must sit within 30 feet or so of the lock for a reliable connection, the closer the better. To join the two, select the new ""WiFi Settings"" option on your lock's settings menu in the app, and from there you'll get a brief prompt to map it to your home WiFi network. Once you've successfully paired the two, you can control August from anywhere you can get online.

Using an external device to get on your lock on your wireless network might seem cumbersome, but it's also the most maintenance-free approach given the current state of wireless technology. Built-in WiFi is certainly possible, but it also means reduced battery life. Along with August,  Kwikset ,  Polycontrol ,  Schlage ,  Yale , and  Lockitron all have locks either in production or coming soon that take this same approach.

What August does not do yet is work with other smart home devices. The company has announced integrations with  SmartThings , the  Logitech Harmony Home , and  Apple's HomeKit, all of which would theoretically tie behaviors between the August lock and other smart home devices. As of this writing none of those partnerships are live.

For the rest of its app features, the August lets you see a complete lock/unlock record for each lock you're assigned to as an owner. It will tell you the time of each action, as well as the user responsible. This logging feature also has a guestbook attached, where a user can leave you a note. I can imagine this might be something an AirBnB owner would make use of.

To protect your account, August boasts ""financial-level"" digital security, which means 128-bit AES software encryption, as well as two-factor authentication for your account log-in. It says it has taken more precautions, but it won't disclose what they are. In all, that seems as robust as most consumer-grade home security products. If you lose your phone, you can simply log in to your account from another device and remove access from the one that's missing.

It's hard not to like the August Smart Lock since it works so well and is so easy to use. From the free e-keys and logical user management, to the reliable automated lock and unlock settings, this lock can legitimately make a small element of your life easier. Yes, both the lag I encountered and the lack of true Internet-based controls are annoying, but those issues feel like limitations of the current technology, rather than design oversights or corner-cutting.

Like the  Nest Learning Thermostat , the  Philips Hue Connected LED light bulbs  and other hyped smart-home products, you will pay what feels like an ambitious premium for the privilege of owning the August Smart Lock. The price isn't so far off from that of its competition, though, and what you get here is a noticeably more polished smart lock."
Ecovent takes smart heating and cooling seriously|"

Cambridge, Mass.-based startup, Ecovent, was founded by Dipul Patel and developed at MIT. Although Ecovent is a new name in home heating and cooling, Patel told me that he has been toying around with this idea since 2008. Back then, he was working at Lockheed Martin and trying to save money for his upcoming wedding.

One ill-fated cost-saving strategy involved shutting off the air vents in select rooms throughout his house. It worked, but then his mom came to visit and ended up spending quite an uncomfortable night in one of Patel's unventilated rooms. This simple mistake prompted him to re-examine the entire concept of whole-home temperature control and eventually turned into Ecovent.

Rather than trying to remember to open and close your vents as needed, Ecovent's solution automatically adjusts them for you. And, instead of a pricey professional install, Ecovent says its wireless, DIY-friendly products can get the job done for roughly $200 a room.

Ecovent manages this with its own temperature, humidity and motion-sensing wall plugs (outfitted with USB ports for good measure), custom vents and an Android and iOS app. Stick the sensor plugs throughout your house, replace your current vents with Ecovent's app-enabled ones, label the various plugs and vents, tell the app your ideal temperature settings by room, and let the system re-route your heat and AC to suit your exact specifications.

According to Ecovent's official press release, it ""applies aeronautical engineering principles to optimize airflow and preserve HVAC system integrity. It also adjusts to changes in the home and learns from users' input over time."" Sounds good to me.

While Ecovent will work with a plain ol' thermostat, it's optimized for smart versions. And although Patel didn't share specifics, he mentioned that Ecovent was planning ahead as far as APIs and third-party partnerships. Pre-orderable  kits are available now; check out Ecoventsystems.com for more details."
Bemo wants to turn your old smart phone into a new smart thermostat (npd8h)|"

For lots of us, buying a new smartphone means selling our old one for pennies on the dollar. San Jose-based start-up Wise Labs, LLC thinks it has a better way with Bemo, a clever device designed to repurpose old smartphones into shiny new smart thermostats. Just install Bemo where your old thermostat used to be, download the free app to your old Android, iOS, or Windows device, then mount it in place on the wall.

Wise Labs is seeking its capital on Kickstarter, where backers can pre-order Bemo for $130 (about £80 in the UK, or just under AU$150 in Australia). A limited number of early-bird discounts are currently available, but even at full price, you'll be spending considerably less than you would for a dedicated smart thermostat like the  Nest , the  Honeywell Lyric , or the  Ecobee3 .

As an alternative, you can pre-order Bemo with an Android device included for $250 (about £155, or roughly AU$285). That price puts it right on par with existing competitors like Nest.

From the touchscreen to the built-in Wi-Fi, Bemo is designed to leverage your old smart phone's hardware into a smart thermostat experience that's both new and familiar. With Bemo's app, Wise Labs is promising the same sorts of features we've come to expect from today's top smart thermostats -- things like advanced scheduling, and geofenced HVAC automations that turn the heat off when you leave for work.

Along with those you'll find some new twists, too, like the ability to stream music or call 911 in an emergency. Wise Labs is also opening Bemo's software to outside developers, leaving the door open for even more creative applications of your existing phone tech.

Bemo is designed for the kinds of 24V HVAC systems found in the US, though the team at Wise Labs says they're working on a version for the 240V systems found in the UK, too. Compatibility beyond those two regions remains to be seen, though Wise Labs is offering to ship Bemo to international buyers, with units expected to arrive by August 2015.

With HomeKit software built into iOS 8 and Google building its smart-home vision around the Nest, the intersection of smartphone and thermostat seems like a natural crossroad for the connected home. That's right where Bemo sits, which seems like awfully smart positioning to me. We'll be sure to keep our eye on it in the coming year."
Foscam Plug and Play Wireless IP Camera FI9826P review: (rfx7i)|"

Foscam's $220 (available in both the UK for £135 and in Australia for AU$230) Plug and Play Wireless IP Camera FI9826P is full of contradictions. It's a high-quality pan, tilt and zoom camera with night vision, two-way talk, an SD card slot and opt-in Cloud storage services. Despite these solid specs, its web interface is extremely antiquated and downright DIY-unfriendly; unfortunately, you have to navigate it to successfully sign up for email notifications and to make a bunch of other camera-related settings adjustments.

Tack on the mobile app's lack of push notifications and the FI9826P's initial promise fades fast. Since it delivers in terms of optics, it will work as a live-streaming solution. But, both the Web and mobile app need major design overhauls to match the real-time, DIY-security-camera-style of Foscam's closest competition.





The FI9826P is a hefty 1.8-pound camera that's available in either black or white.  If your router has a Wi-Fi Protected Setup button (WPS), you can connect it wirelessly. Otherwise you're stuck tethering the camera to the router via the included Ethernet cable. I went the WPS route and experience a few hiccups early on.

The ""quick installation guide"" walks you through a series of steps -- pressing the WPS button on the camera and on the router, downloading the Foscam Viewer app on your Android or iOS device (there are several unofficial Foscam apps, Foscam viewer is the one you want), scanning the QR code on the bottom of the camera (quite a balancing act) and registering with a unique username and password.

This process was pretty confusing. I created a username and a password only for it to return an error message: ""Login Fail: Username or Password Incorrect."" Apparently, you have to log in the first time with Foscam's default username, admin, and no password. Then, it gives you the chance to update your info, but I had to reset the camera before it actually accepted my new username and password.

From there, I was able to access live streaming in either single-or-quadrant-view (great if you have multiple cameras running simultaneously). I was also able to record video, take snapshots, pan, tilt, zoom, set night vision and enable audio for two-way talk.

It also has an ""Enable Push Message"" option for motion-related security events, but I wasn't having any luck getting it to work. Foscam confirmed that push alerts are not currently available on the Foscam Viewer app (either for Android or iOS users), but that a new app should be coming out within the month that will offer this feature. How odd.



While the FI9826P has some pretty good specs, the mobile app's missing push alerts seriously limit that whole remote access thing. And the Web app isn't any better. In fact, it was the most perplexing part of this so-called ""plug-and-play"" camera.

The Web app doesn't function like the intuitive ones we've seen from other brands, where you use the same username and password from the mobile app and simply sign in via the brand's website. No. The process was much more convoluted and not for the DIY faint of heart -- not exactly difficult, but certainly not straightforward. Fortunately, Foscam has a series of tutorials for Web app setup.

Configuration will vary depending on the type of computer you're using, but I had to download something called the IP Camera Tool and make sure that my computer was on the same Wi-Fi network as the camera itself. Then, I had to confirm the camera's IP address, Subnet Mask and Http port and add in Gateway and DNS Server details. From there, I was assigned a unique IP-based URL that I was able to use as my camera's custom Web address.

Of course, that means that you can't use the Web app when you're outside of the home network's range. But, you can use the newly configured Web app to opt in to email notifications -- that's the only feature that makes the FI9826P even remotely reliable as an on-the-go security monitor. It required a similarly tedious series of steps, though.

If you have some level of familiarity with routers, these steps may not slow you down much. It helped that Foscam's support section is fairly extensive, but it really shouldn't be that complicated -- especially when you consider Dropcam, Samsung and other close competitor's comparatively intuitive apps.

Here's the good news: Once everything was set up, it worked really well. The Web app lets you make all sorts of adjustments to the pan, tilt and zoom features as well as set zones and schedules for the motion alert emails. The emails were delivered promptly and included three different photos taken when the motion sensor was triggered. Sometimes the photos captured the cause of the motion alert and other times it missed -- pretty good, but not as reliable as a push alert or a push alert and an email.

The live streaming in day and night vision mode in both apps were stellar. And Foscam gives you the option between SD card storage (up to 32 GB) and Cloud services, which range from free (30 minutes of live streaming, saves up to 30 clips or 100 images) to $50/month (unlimited live streaming, saves a month of clips and 100,000 images).

In addition to its old-school interfaces, the Foscam FI9826P doesn't have an IFTTT channel, protocol integrations or third-party partnerships. That's another way that names like Dropcam and Samsung have Foscam beat. By staying true to its passé ""IP camera"" name, Foscam is really missing out on a lot of potential action in the smart-home sector.

At $220 (£135, AU$230), the FI9826P seems to offer an exceptional value. It shares a lot of features with other Wi-Fi cameras we've reviewed, but its pan, tilt and zoom functionality really stood out. Sadly, even impressive specs don't matter much when you can't rely on its apps to provide the information you need when you need it. Hopefully, Foscam's next round of app updates will add that usability factor that's sorely missing and then I'll be able to reevaluate its ability to compete as a DIY home security camera."
D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Camera review: (7drbd)|"

Being able to see your home from anywhere and confirm that everything is okay with your own eyes makes a device like the $120 D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Camera seem extremely useful. (The same model sells in the UK for about £80, and in Australia for AU$200.) D-Link's camera with the unwieldy name does well in this regard. The 640x480 resolution isn't great, but it's enough to clearly see what's going on. And the ability to manually look around the room from afar by panning, tilting, and zooming the camera worked well and can help you check every nook and cranny.

If you can't keep your eyes on your home, though, don't expect D-Link to help. Aside from the live viewing, the camera promises features that should allow it to function as a sentry, alerting you when something unexpected happens. Unfortunately, these video and sound notifications are unwieldy at best and completely non-functioning at worst. None of the detection features are reliable enough to actually help with security, so you'll want to look elsewhere for that elusive peace of mind.

Initially, I was quite hopeful for the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Network Camera. It offers a promising mix of features, especially for its price, and without any monthly fees. Similar fee-free smart-home cameras include the  $200, Â£190 Dropcam Pro  (not yet available in Australia, but converts to about AU$230); the $200  US-only Piper ; the  $190, Â£160 Samsung SmartCam HD Pro  (not yet available in Australia, but converts to about AU$215); and the  $130, Â£130, AU$170 Belkin NetCam HD+ .

The more expensive cameras all offer better resolution than D-Link and wider viewing angles to boot. Samsung, Dropcam, and Piper have a full 1080p image with 128-degree, 130-degree, and 180-degree respective fields of view. Belkin only has 720p with a 95-degree viewing angle, but D-Link's picture maxes out at 640x480 with a 66-degree horizontal viewing angle. Next to the Belkin camera, the D-Link's narrower viewing angle feels especially underwhelming.

However, it makes up for the smaller viewing angle by allowing you to remotely turn and tilt the camera. With night vision, a built-in microphone (though not two-way audio), and alerts for both motion and sound, D-Link gets back to being quite competitive on features, especially if you don't feel the need to monitor your home in high definition.

To top it off, D-Link brought their prowess with Wi-Fi routers to the camera with a unique extender mode. This allows it to act as a mini-router and bring signal to previously unreachable areas of your home. I was excited for this feature in particular, and thought that if the D-Link cam could act as a router and an effective security camera, the $120 price point would make it a steal.

The camera looks sleek. An all white base holds the black rounded lens shell. It's not exactly inconspicuous, but I wouldn't call it outlandish either, and I didn't mind having it on my shelf. You won't have to worry about any physical construction, the camera comes assembled complete with a power cord, an ethernet cord, and a simple instruction manual. The box does include a bracket for mounting the camera to a wall so you can set up an optimal viewing angle.

Getting it set up on your home Wi-Fi network is a bit more involved, and requires that you use your Windows or  Mac  computer. A ""zero configuration"" page in the manual tells you how to skip most of the steps if you're also using a D-Link router. I was, and didn't get it to work right. The more complex steps necessary in that circumstance require you to download setup software and do some light configuration. Nothing proved too daunting, but this certainly isn't Wink's ""hold your phone near a sensor"" approach where you're done in a few seconds.

I was more than willing to jump through a few hoops in the set up for the promise of extra Wi-Fi range in addition to a smart security camera. Unfortunately, it didn't end up giving much of a boost.

For the mobile app, D-Link uses its old myDLink Lite app, rather than its new MyDLink Home app that debuted with its new  smart plug . The new app is supposed to let you control all of the D-Link products on your network, but for some reason that doesn't include support for this new camera.

Though first you'll need to get it up and running on your computer, you can then control the D-Link using either the website or the myDLink Lite app. I started playing around with its panning and tilting features. The range of motion impressed me, and I was successfully able to follow my coworkers around a room, listen to their conversations, and generally creep them out. I didn't really notice the lack of resolution until I zoomed in; standard definition looked sharp enough.

With the digital zoom, the clarity peels away and things get downright blurry at full 4x zoom. The camera itself doesn't zoom, so the function just makes the existing picture larger on your computer, and the lack of definition shines through.

At any time, you can snap a picture from the camera's viewpoint, so you can capture a special moment or an incriminating one. Just don't expect the zoom to show up in the snap. Because the zoom doesn't happen on the camera itself, even if you're computer's picture shows a tight view of your kid reaching for the cookie jar, the saved snapshot will be back at the full unzoomed view of the kitchen.

Controlling the pan-and-tilt action was another source of minor disappointment. On your browser, you have to manipulate the horizontal x-axis or the vertical y-axis individually, and the camera won't move until you release the slider. This makes getting to the right spot a guessing game. Fortunately, you can save a location once you find it, and automatically move the camera to that position with the click of a button.

Manipulating the view with the app proved slightly easier. It allows for intuitive swipes and pinches, though the lag between input on the app and movement of the camera still caused me a bit of frustration.

Overall, in terms of live viewing, the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Camera gave a competent showing and will allow you to spy on your family with reasonable clarity of picture and sound. But because the camera isn't inconspicuous and because the movement of panning and tilting isn't silent, don't expect to remain incognito while you watch.

While it can grant you peace of mind with a visual check-in, the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night camera proves almost completely useless at keeping an eye on things while you can't. The customizable alerts and automatic recordings should allow this, but they don't work consistently.

You can tell the system what, when and how to monitor. The camera can't move on its own, but you can point it at your prized Han Solo figurine (not that I have one) and highlight an area. Then, set an alert only if there's motion in that particular spot between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. Similarly, you can set a decibel threshold for sound alerts and even movement sensitivity.

Getting the sensitivity levels where you want them is another guessing game. Sound is easier, as a scrolling graph shows the current levels in the room, but movement you'll just have to ballpark. Like the initial setup, this process needs to be done on the website, though you can turn the alerts on and off with the app.

I turned on email alerts and push notification on my phone and went to work triggering events... and nothing happened. For a full day, I screamed and danced in front of the camera hoping for it to send me something. Nothing. Worse, when I left it on for an extended period, the sound grew unusable, even with the live feed. All I could hear was loud, persistent feedback.

After unplugging it for a day and resetting it to factory settings, the sound managed to fix itself, but the alerts didn't. Randomly, with no input on my part, sound alerts started to happen the second time I left the camera plugged in for more than 24 hours. At that time, I also received the only push notification I would ever get. I could never get those to replicate, and motion detection still didn't function.

To get motion working, I had to go in to advanced settings, which require you to click at least two different warnings about the security of your computer, and download a specific video software driver. Finally, I was up and running, but the email alerts still proved slow and inconsistent and I never got another push notification.

I tried it with a replacement unit from D-Link, to rule out whether I had a faulty one, and experienced the same inconsistency. When I reached out to D-Link, they confirmed that they had replicated my problem and were ""looking into"" it.

While the alerts are problematic, the recording function doesn't work at all. The link in the email notification takes you to a page that should show you a video or snapshot of what caused the alert. Instead, it just takes you back to the live view. The recordings never once worked for me.

Thus, to catch someone using this camera, you either need to be watching, or you need to hope it was one of the times the email came through right way, then check your email, click the link, log-in to the server, confirm that you want to allow Java to run, and wait for the lag to catch up and the camera view to load. You'll basically need to hope your thief decides to stick around and have a cup of coffee.

The other DIY security cameras I mentioned earlier have different ways of integrating with other connected devices in your home. Piper doubles as a Z-wave hub and Dropcam has Bluetooth. The hope is to turn these cameras into the eyes of your smart home, so it'll know when to lock the doors and flash the lights if something is amiss. Piper even has a built-in siren that can let out a screech to send a potential thief running.

The best the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Camera can do to improve your smart home is add an underwhelming amount of extra Wi-Fi range. The idea was a good one. In practice, I checked the signal boundaries around the office, and found that no matter where I positioned the camera, I got a boost of a few extra feet at most. D-Link's cloud camera fails to be the comprehensive solution which its competitors offer.

D-Link's newest camera is an unrefined experience at best with its unpolished -- and sometimes non-functional -- software. Fortunately you have other reliable options from  Piper ,  Dropcam ,  Samsung , or even Belkin, with the similarly priced and much more competent  NetCam HD+ . They all cost a little more than the D-Link Pan & Tilt Day/Night Camera, but their reliability when it comes to security makes each more than worth it."
CoinGuard keeps track of what's important to you (mvsm2)|"

The Pilot Labs CoinGuard is supposed to be a simple supplement to your existing home security setup. It's a small, coin-shaped sensor that you can attach to pretty much anything -- from a family heirloom to that box of cookies that's off-limits before dinnertime. Then, if someone tries to make off with that priceless piece of jewelry or a fistful of Oreos, you should get an instant push notification.

It reminds me somewhat of  Dropcam Tabs , those versatile motion sensors supposedly rated for indoor and outdoor use -- although Tabs seem to have fallen off the radar since Dropcam teamed up with Nest. CoinGuard is also reminiscent of  Sense Mother's  ""Cookies"" -- a cute name for its remote motion and temperature sensors. Cookies can attach to your laptop as easily as a door or window to alert you when something's amiss or simply to track ambient temperature.

CoinGuards looks similarly versatile.

Like Cookies, CoinGuards need a hub to translate the Wi-Fi signal. This unassuming hub has a single button for simple setup and variety of LED status indicators, including ZigBee, Pilot Labs' protocol of choice for this product. Each CoinGuard comes with a replaceable battery that it claims can last for more than a year and an operating range of over 300 feet. That's much better than Cookies -- they only have a 65-foot range.

The related iHomeWare app is only available for iOS right now, but an Android version is in the works. You should be able to arm and disarm multiple CoinGuards from the app and Pilot Labs' Cloud-based monitoring takes care of the push notification portion.

Pilot Labs' CoinGuard has an open API and expects to announce an IFTTT channel by the end of 2014. It also  has a variety of other in-house smart home products that should integrate seamlessly into the iHomeWare app, including smoke and carbon monoxide sensors, water leak sensors and more.

The CoinGuard Kickstarter campaign launched today, with prices for a hub and one CoinGuard sensor starting at $45 (roughly £28, AU$50). CoinGuards can be shipped internationally for an additional charge and Pilot Labs says it should be able to start sending out units as early as December."
This home security camera claims to work no matter what (q9yms)|"

Link-Union's founder, Andy Benatti, travels a lot. He tried out a variety of webcams to stay connected to his family while on the road, but felt that they all came up short in one way or another. So, he created his own version: the Link-U Hybrid SmartCam.

Most DIY home security cameras offer either local or remote storage. Samsung's $190, £160 SmartCam HD Pro (SD card local storage; not yet available in Australia, but converts to about AU$215) and Dropcam's $200, £190 Dropcam Pro (cloud server remote storage; not yet available in Australia, but converts to about AU$230) are two such examples. The Link-U comes with both -- an SD card slot (up to 32GB) and cloud access via Google or iCloud Drive.





The Link-U has another intriguing feature: Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity, thanks to an internal 3G/4G modem. This hybrid camera also has two power sources, a standard plug adapter and an 8-hour backup battery. That means that your camera should still function and the feed should still be accessible on the Android or iOS app even if your Wi-Fi cuts out and you lose power.

It also has Bluetooth LE. So, you should be able to connect a variety of smart home gadgets, although there aren't any specifics on third-party integrations just yet. This list of features sure seems astounding, especially when you consider that none of the models we've reviewed offer quite as many contingencies in case of spotty Wi-Fi/power outages/both.

The Link-U Hybrid SmartCam recently launched on Indiegogo and early backers can snag one for just $100, which converts to about £60 or AU$113 (the camera is expected to retail for $250 eventually, which converts to £155 or AU$285). The very first batch of production-ready models should ship in January 2015. Find out more on Link-Union's Indiegogo page."
Ecobee3 Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat, HomeKit-enabled review: (dswj8)|"

Editors' note, June 10, 2016: This review has been updated with details on IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, and Apple HomeKit integrations.

Editors' note, November 19, 2014: Ecobee recently released version 1.1.1 of its Ecobee3 app and adjusted the sensitivity of its touchscreen. I have since retested the thermostat and the text and overall score have been updated accordingly.

Toronto-based Ecobee may not have the name recognition of  	Honeywell or Nest, but it was actually the first company to come out with an app-enabled thermostat. Its initial line of smart thermostats was funneled through dealers though, which limited the brand's ability to compete in the do-it-yourself arena.

To satisfy this new market, the company has rolled out the $249 Ecobee3 (£155/AU$285), a DIY climate kit comprised of a Wi-Fi thermostat and a remote temperature sensor that work with  	IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit and more.  It doesn't quite have the same design appeal as Nest, but the Ecobee3 is a thermostat I can wholeheartedly recommend.

Your installation  	success will vary a lot depending on your HVAC system and your level of electrical wiring savvy. The ideal will have a five-wire system, in which case you can literally just swap out your old thermostat for your new Ecobee3.

If your HVAC unit only has four wires running to your thermostat, you're not out of luck, but you will have an extra step to deal with. The Ecobee3 requires a C (or Common) wire connection, which you won't find on a four-wire HVAC system. To get around this problem, Ecobee includes something called a Power Extender Kit with your purchase free of charge that does the work of the C wire without you actually having to add that pesky fifth wire yourself (or having to call an electrician to do it for you).

You will need to know your way around your HVAC system to install the Extender Kit, since you need to connect it directly to the controller board on your HVAC unit, provided yours is new enough to have one. If not, you can still reconfigure the wiring, but budding DIYers will likely want to call in some experienced help. Whether you use the Extender Kit or not, this all seems unnecessary given that the competing   	Honeywell Lyric  and  Nest Learning Thermostat  will both work fine on a four-wire system.

For my own installation, I had to go with the rewire option given my near 20-year old HVAC unit. I had help from Steve Conaway, one of our technical editors, who rewired my unit to give it a C wire. It worked, but it certainly wasn't convenient.

Once the Ecobee3 was installed, it recognized the wires I connected and walked me through the configuration process. This included adding my home Wi-Fi details, selecting Fahrenheit or Celsius -- all of the stuff you'd expect from an initial thermostat setup. I also paired the included remote sensor to the thermostat, which took about a minute. The remote sensor is a handy extra that comes with the Ecobee3. It essentially acts as a standalone ambient indoor temperature monitor you can put in another room. It can also tell the thermostat whether you're home or away.

Registration is the final hurdle between connecting your thermostat to the Web and mobile apps and enjoying the full functionality of your Ecobee3. The early production versions of both were extremely glitchy, but I revisited them about 6 weeks after the original review date. The  displays looks the same, but the wonky usability issues are gone. That means that you can expect a much breezier registration process and interaction with the apps overall.

Visually, the Ecobee3 looks nice enough, with a touchscreen rather than the radial dials we've seen lately with the Lyric and the Nest. The homescreen displays the mode -- whether you're in cool, heat, auto or off -- the percentage of indoor humidity, the current indoor temperature, a temperature slider for manual tweaks, and quick access to settings, home and away mode updates and the local forecast. It also has a built-in motion sensor that helps the thermostat detect whether you're home or away.

Unfortunately, the touchscreen was much less responsive than I'd like. The ""return to homescreen"" button in the top left was particularly stubborn and took several tries to respond on more than one occasion. Fortunately, Ecobee has since made adjustments to the touchscreen sensitivity and it no longer takes multiple tries to get the buttons to work.

Moving beyond the early usability issues I encountered with the touchscreen and the apps, this thermostat actually performed quite well. It responded quickly and accurately when I adjusted the temperate in person and from the apps. I really liked that I could access the local forecast information easily from the thermostat's homescreen. And, the Smart Home/Away and Follow Me features present intriguing alternatives to the Lyric's glitchy geofencing home/away modes and the Nest's algorithm-based learning.

While I entered in a schedule that approximated my regular home and away settings, the Smart Home/Away feature transformed the Ecobee3 from a regular programmable thermostat into something smart and adaptable. Basically, it works like this: I programmed the thermostat to be set to Away mode between 8am and 6pm, but happened to return home for lunch one day. The thermostat and remote sensor's built-in motion and proximity detectors were able to detect that I was in fact home and automatically switched back to Home mode.

The Follow Me feature was similarly useful. Like Smart Home/Away, this option relies on the thermostat and remote sensor's built-in sensors to pinpoint your location and figure out when to kick on your heating and cooling system to make you as comfortable as possible. And Ecobee's Home IQ feature provides a breakdown of the energy and money you're saving with your shiny new smart thermostat, similar to Nest's monthly energy reports.

The Ecobee3 has an IFTTT channel and partnerships with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Wink, SmartThings, and a handful of other third-party products. Please note: The original Ecobee3 thermostat does not work with HomeKit. Instead, you will have to buy the second-gen HomeKit-enabled model for integration with Siri.

With IFTTT, you can create rules like, ""If the Ecobee3 switches to either Home or Away mode automatically, then send me a notification,"" or ""If your phone leaves a specified geofence range, then set my Ecobee3 to Away mode."" The Alexa and HomeKit integrations add voice control into the mix, so you can say,""Alexa/Siri, set my thermostat to 75 degrees."" The Wink and SmartThings integrations offer opportunities for the Ecobee3 to be part of a multi-protocol smart home system.

Given Nest's relationship to Google and Honeywell's history as a leader in the heating and cooling industry, these sorts of alliances are integral to Ecobee's success -- and the team has steadily added new ones in tandem with the growth of the smart home market.

Ecobee's $249 Ecobee3 smart thermostat has a lot to offer, even more so now since its early glitches have been fixed. So after a bit of a shaky start, the Ecobee3 is now well worth your consideration. It has all of the features you want from a thermostat plus add-ons like the remote sensor and the Power Extender Kit. Adding in partnerships like Alexa and HomeKit as well as its availability in Apple and Best Buy stores make the Ecobee3 a major competitor in the smart thermostat arena.

I still prefer the well-rounded Nest Learning Thermostat for its superior design and usability, and because you don't have to use a C wire (or a special workaround) for the installation, but the Ecobee3 is the best choice if you want Apple HomeKit integration and a remote sensor to track any room-to-room temperature disparities."
Sense Mother review: (ihc99)|"

Sense's $300 Mother has been making the rounds at recent tech conferences and every time we spot those blank, lifeless eyes and ever so slightly upturned smile among the chaos we're unanimously struck by its sheer creepiness. Factor in Sense's bizarre branding messages -- ""Who takes care of you better than your mom? Mother only takes care of what you want. Here's Mother: she's like a mom, only better."" --and I'm thinking that I'd rather meet Hannibal Lecter in a dark alleyway than ""Mother.""

Since Sense's quirky smart home product just made the leap to production, we thought we'd suspend our initial design reservations and actually figure out what this thing does. And while I still haven't warmed to its aesthetics or in-your-face marketing, it all started to make a lot more sense when I began testing this (surprisingly) delightful home-automation kit.



Essentially, Mother is a data-tracker with a ton of built-in flexibility. Four ""Cookies,"" or remote sensors, come with your purchase and you can use them to monitor motion and temperature. Cookies communicate with the Mother hub and display all sorts of useful information on the related web and mobile apps -- up to 65 feet. When Cookies exceed 65 feet, they will continue to log data, but you won't be able to access it until you're back in range of Mother (See? Doesn't that just sound creepy?).

Yes, Sense's Mother is on the pricy side and the 65-foot range is a bit of a bummer, but this $300 kit is uniquely versatile, giving you the freedom to track pretty much anything from how many steps you walk in a day to how well you sleep at night.

Mother is a bulbous, glossy white hub that's shaped like a bowling pin or a Russian nesting doll. Connect it directly to your Wi-Fi router via the included Ethernet cable and follow the instructions on the Web app to register it and pair its four colorful motion-and-temperature-sensing Cookies.

This process was simple enough, but did nothing to counter our first impressions of Mother.

Each hub has a unique identifier, but instead of a 24-digit alphanumeric code or some other randomly generated ID number, Mother has a name. Mine's called ""Elwanda Melinda"" -- certainly easier to type in than a long string of letters and numbers, but significantly weirder.

The same goes for each Cookie. The orange one is called ""United Sundae,"" the yellow one is called ""Adored Crunch,"" the green one is called ""Natural Connection,"" and the blue one is called ""Ideal Mountain.""

You can also change Mother's LED eye color during the initial setup and in settings afterwards. There are eight options, including blue, pink, light blue, yellow, green, purple, orange and red. I steered clear of red and opted for sedate purple, lest this inanimate Mother-hub comes alive and starts taking over my condo, the neighborhood, and eventually, the whole world.

Once everything is configured to your satisfaction on the web app, you can use the same login info to access the mobile version, which is available for Android, iOS, and Windows users.

Select ""Add an app"" from the Web app's Senseboard homepage to start tracking things; the Web app is where you'll want to go to make any major adjustments to Mother's setup. The mobile app is well designed, but it provides a limited snapshot, whereas the Web app offers the full breadth of customization options available to you.

And your options are pretty diverse -- I used each of the four Cookies to test Mother's many features and some sensors even performed more than one function simultaneously.

I attached two of the sensors to my doors (front and patio) to receive push notifications whenever they opened. I also used them to track the ambient temperate. I put another sensor in my pocket and it worked just like a pedometer, tracking my steps and telling me how many calories I was burning. I also set it up to act as a proximity sensor, so that Mother would disable the door-related motion alerts when it sensed that I was home. I shoved another sensor under my fitted sheet and it sent sleep data to the app and acted as my alarm in the morning, one that went ahead and woke me up when it noticed that I was stirring shortly before my official alarm time, similar to the  Hello Sense sleep system .

All of the most recent data collected will be displayed on the Senseboard and you can temporarily disable, delete and adjust any Cookie and any of its functions any time you want. When you click on one of the functions, you will get a more detailed look, so you can see a sleep graph and itemized sleep stats: I got 79 percent deep sleep, 7 percent light sleep, 6 percent intermediate sleep and 8 percent awake sleep on the night of September 25.

Most importantly, everything worked as expected. I received push notifications whenever the doors opened, got sleep cycle-related data and was able to monitor my steps and calories burned all from one central location. It's like a fitness band, a home-automation kit and a security system all in one, and the results are very intriguing. There's really nothing quite like Mother on the market today.

Still it does have some limitations. Cookies can only communicate with the hub up to roughly 65 feet. So, any time you take a one outside of that range, you won't receive the data until you return. I also found the fitness tracker setup slightly annoying. While you can switch between Metric and Imperial units, there was no place to enter height in feet and inches -- it only had a section for feet, so I had to enter that I was 5.6 feet tall instead of 5 feet and 7 inches. Close enough.

Sense's $300 Mother home automation and data-tracking kit is definitely unconventional, but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't make a good addition to your smart home. If you find that you're looking for a little organization in your life and like the idea of a Mother/hub/red-eyed overlord to keep you in check, Sense has a solid solution. Still, Mother is on the pricy side and you're out of luck if you want to track your steps on-the-go. Then again, it's highly adaptable and might just make some sense out of your hectic routine -- just like the overbearing mother you never had."
GE Link Connected LED review: (v9wyn)|"

If you need evidence of the rapid evolution we've seen in both the lighting and smart home markets, look no further than the GE Link LED. With Zigbee-powered wireless smarts built right in, each bulb costs just $15. A year ago, that would have been a fair deal for one of its non-connected counterparts.

The Link LED is built to integrate into Wink's emerging smart home platform, which means it'll work with other Wink-approved gadgets -- a fairly wide lineup including the likes of  	Quirky,  Dropcam ,  Honeywell ,  Lutron , and even competing smart bulbs from  TCP  and  Philips Hue . Couple that with the low cost of the  Wink Hub  that controls it all, and you're looking at a pretty compelling foundation for the smart home.

That said, I'm not convinced that Wink is ready for primetime. Product after product, we've come away with the same complaint: glitchy software. Despite getting some things right, the Link LEDs were no exception, causing plenty of headaches during the testing process. There's still a lot to like about them, and at that price point, I think you can definitely afford to try one out. However, I also think I'd wait for Wink to polish the user experience a bit more before buying in too heavily.

GE's Link LED isn't designed to blend in with the bulbs that came before it. With its clear globe and exposed hardware, it makes no attempt to pass itself off as an ordinary light, which is the recent approach we've seen many LED competitors take. Even compared to other smart LEDs like the  	 Philips Hue Lux , the  Connected by TCP LED , and the  Belkin WeMo LED , the GE Link is the bulb that looks the most conspicuous.

Like those other smart options, the GE Link promises to last 25,000 hours, and offers around 800 lumens of light output at a warm, yellowy color temperature. GE gets there using 12 watts, which is slightly less efficient than the competition, but still a worthy upgrade over incandescents.

Something else the GE Link LED shares with its competitors is smart dimming capabilities, which simply means that you'll be able to dial the light up and down through the Wink app. However, the Link LED doesn't dim down quite as far as the others, which were able to get as low as 0.5 percent of initial brightness before shutting off. We couldn't get the Link LED down any lower than 10 percent, which was a bit disappointing. I also noticed more lag than the competition as I dimmed the light up and down.

In other basic spec tests, the Link LED did much better, most notably in our color rendering tests. In front of our spectrometer, the Link LED registered a very impressive score of 90 out of 100. A high score like that means that the GE Link LED will illuminate colors more accurately and vividly than much of the competition.

That score of 90 is better than any other smart LED we've tested, and just a few points shy of the LEDs that sit atop our color rendering leaderboard, the  	 Cree TW Series LED  and  the Editors' Choice-winning GE Reveal LED floodlight . Neither of those bulbs is smart, and the GE Link LED costs less than both of them.

The bottom line is that the GE Link's lighting specs are surprisingly good given how much you'll pay for it. If you took the smarts out, it would still be a fairly competitive 60W replacement LED.

Still, lighting specs are only half of the story here. The GE Link is built to compete with other connected LEDs, so you'll want to be sure and factor in the smart features and the usability of the app before making a buying decision.

To access those smart features, you'll need one of three hubs to act as translator between your phone's Wi-Fi and the bulb's Zigbee. Your first option is the Link Hub, a small $30 device that simply plugs into a spare socket, then talks to the bulbs and nothing else. Next up is the  Wink Hub , a $50 gadget with additional radios built in, allowing it to control more than just your lighting. Finally, there's the soon-to-be-released  Wink Relay , a futuristic, Android-powered touchscreen wall panel that'll sell for $300.

"" data-image-credit=""Screenshot by Ry Crist/CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""ge-link-led-wink-app-success.png"" data-image-filename=""ge-link-led-wink-app-success.png"" data-image-date-created=""2014/09/26"" data-image-width=""640"" data-image-height=""1136"" data-image-watermark=""1"">

GE offers a Link LED starter kit with two bulbs and the Link Hub for a total of $50, which is half of what you'll spend on comparable two-bulb kits from Belkin and Philips. In addition, for a limited time, Home Depot is offering $30 off the price of the Wink Hub when you buy two Link LEDs, essentially giving you a starter kit with an upgraded hub at that same, accessible $50 price point.

Once you're up and running with your hub of choice, you'll connect your Link LEDs by screwing them in and turning them on when the Wink app tells you to. This sounds easy, but it took me multiple tries before the bulb registered. I tried again, this time with a different Wink Hub, and again, pairing things up was a bit of pain, and certainly more tedious than it should have been.

The Wink App offers simple controls for each bulb, with a button to turn the light on or off and a slider bar to dim the light up and down. You'll also be able to combine multiple bulbs into a group, allowing you to control all of them at once.

Beyond remote control of your lights, the Wink app offers automation, too. This starts with basic scheduling -- you can program the lights to turn on and off at various times of the day, and view your lighting schedule on a calendar. When I tested Wink's scheduling out, it never failed to turn the light on or off when it was supposed to.

Your other automation option is to use what Wink calls ""Robots,"" which are simply recipes that tie your lighting to an external trigger. The first one I tested was a proximity command. Wink monitors your phone's location, and can automatically turn the lights on and off as you come a go, a feature called ""geofencing.""

The Quirky Aros Smart Air Conditioner, another Wink product, offers geofencing, too, but we couldn't ever get it to work when we tested the thing out. Fortunately, the Link LEDs fared much better, successfully turning off whenever I'd leave the office, then turning on again right as I'd pull back into the parking lot.

Wink's Robots can also tie your lighting to other Wink-friendly products. I tested this out with the Quirky Spotter Multipurpose Sensor, telling Wink to turn the lights on whenever the Spotter detected motion, then back off when the motion stopped. I wasn't too impressed with the Spotter when I first reviewed it, but it did the job in this test, reliably turning the light on whenever I walked past it, then back off when I was gone. That made for two signs of improvement from Wink.

However, at this point, the Link LED began to glitch on us. Immediately after deleting those two motion sensing robots in the app, the light began alternating between full brightness and minimum brightness every thirty seconds or so, and stopped responding to my attempts to control it from the app. Even after unscrewing it and then screwing it back in, I couldn't control the thing.

My only option was to delete the Link LED from the system, then add it back in. That'd be especially frustrating if I had already programmed a good deal of robots, as I'd be forced to enter them all back into the app.

I wondered if maybe I was missing a firmware update somewhere, and sure enough, the Wink app was telling me that I needed to update the Hub. I told it to go ahead and do so, but then several minutes later, seemingly still in the middle of the update, the app reverted back to the beginning of the process, telling me an update was available. I wasn't sure if it had cancelled my update, or if there were simply more than one, so I started the process again. The same thing happened again. And then again. And then again on a different device.

None of this is to say that Wink is unusable, but it can definitely be frustrating -- certainly more so than Belkin, TCP, or Philips Hue. If you're willing to put up with that, though, the smart features are actually pretty sharp.

GE's Wink-ready Link LEDs have a lot going for them. At their core, they offer strong light quality, with a fairly exceptional color rendering score. Add in the smart scheduling, geofencing, and compatibility with other Wink products, and you've got a $15 bulb that looks like a potential best buy.

Still, you aren't just buying the bulb -- you're buying into Wink's smart home platform. Though appealing and affordable, it's a wobblier platform than others, with glitches and app crashes that compromise an otherwise appealing user experience. I like these bulbs, but if you wanted to wait for Wink to work its kinks out before buying them, I wouldn't blame you."
Haven's Smart Lock ditches the deadbolt (d8kr8)|"

A barrage of locks have entered the smart home scene lately, including  August ,  Goji ,  Kwikset's Kevo , and  Lockitron . While each brand made different design choices, they all follow one key DIY principle -- that you should be able to attach your new smart lock to your existing deadbolt.

This install-light approach is an appealing option for a lot of folks, but startup Haven wasn't impressed. It claims that these retrofit smart locks offer convenience, but not security.

We definitely saw  weakness with the Kwikset Kevo, which one of our technical editors, Steve, disabled in less than 5 minutes and Chris Lind, a professional locksmith from Bob Cook Locksmiths, circumvented in just 30 seconds.

Some dismiss the limitations of deadbolts, claiming that no lock can deter a determined burglar in the end. Haven seems to have found fault with this argument, though, citing ""weak"" locks as the reason for the majority of successful forced entries. So, it decided to create a new standard for the vulnerable entry-points in your home: The Haven Smart Lock, a device that actually avoids the lock altogether.

Haven's Smart Lock is a steel, glass, reinforced nylon and aluminum strip that you install at the base of your door inside your house. It's supposed to act like a doorjamb that wedges up against the door when engaged and releases when unlocked. You can manually release the lock from inside if you don't have a connected gadget handy, but otherwise, this Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-enabled gizmo is designed to work with Android and iOS devices and well as wearables.

That way, you can come and go as you please without the bother of keys and you can extend access to friends and family, too. This battery-powered Smart Lock is equipped with relays so it will continue to operate if you lose power or if your internet connection goes kaput. Haven also claims to have Nest Developer Program and Apple iOS 8 HomeKit integration in the works.

Haven's Kickstarter campaign launched a couple of days ago, and it's already a third of the way toward its $150,000 funding goal (which converts to roughly £90,000 or AU$170,000). Smart Lock prices for early backers start at $200 (roughly £125 and AU$225) and units are supposed to ship August 2015."
Orbnext review: (5k62o)|"

""Your world at a glance"" -- that's what Colorado-based Advanced Lumonics is offering with Orbnext, a Wi-Fi enabled, color-changing desktop novelty. With 10 multicolor Cree LEDs housed within frosted glass and its own channel on IFTTT, Orbnext can change colors to notify you of things like important emails, new followers on Twitter or anything else you can think up.

The rub, of course, is that Orbnext costs a hefty $129. In Australia, that comes out to around AU$185 once you factor in international shipping -- in the UK, you'll need to drop a cool £100. That certainly isn't inexpensive, especially when you consider color-changing LED competitors like  Philips Hue ,  Tabu Lumen  and  Lifx  that each cost a lot less per light. Cool factor aside, Orbnext is still very much a novelty item, and unless it has you dazzled, I think you can safely resist the urge to splurge.

As I'm sure you've noticed by this point, the cube-shaped Orbnext isn't an orb at all. The name is a callback to the  Ambient Orb , a color-changing sphere from 2004 that offered basic ambient notifications before notifications were really a thing. The Ambient Orb was attractive and futuristic -- perhaps to a fault. As CNET's Brian Cooley said at the time, ""All we know is that we like this thing.""

Advanced Lumonics is likely hoping that in today's smartphone-centric age -- and with IFTTT doing the heavy lifting -- a color-coded, design-oriented, ambient light notification gadget makes a little more sense. To an extent, I think that it does. As a geeky sort of splurge, I can see the appeal.

That appeal cuts two ways. First, there's the surprising practicality of the thing. With Orbnext and IFTTT, you'll be able to program color changes for whatever you deem important. Maybe you want it turn bright red if the boss emails you, or green whenever your fitness tracker detects that you've hit a daily goal. For a subtle, unobtrusive notification mechanism that lets you keep your phone in your pocket for once, you could really do a lot worse.

The other angle comes down to design: Orbnext is pretty to look at. With frosted glass and colorful minimalism, it's an attractive little desktop decoration capable of casting a futuristic sheen over just about any workstation.

Still, the minimalist design isn't perfect. While the frosted glass certainly gives Orbnext the feel of a high-end gadget, it also looks a little bit like plastic. One or two additional design flourishes might have helped to reinforce the high-end aesthetic.

For basic control over Orbnext, you'll use the ""blink.n.play"" app from Advanced Lumonics. That name comes from the pairing process -- to connect your Orbnext, you'll hold it over your phone while the app blinks a rapid light pattern coded with your Wi-Fi info. That's the same trick that Quirky uses to connect products like the  Porkfolio , the  Pivot Power Genius , and the  Aros Smart Air Conditioner , which isn't too surprising, given that those products use the same ElectricIMP motherboard as Orbnext.

The blink.n.play app definitely errs on the sparse side, with very basic, limited controls for Orbnext. You can set Orbnext to change color as the stock market rises and falls, or as the temperature changes. There's also a Lamp mode where you can quickly choose from one of 12 colored presets, along with a full color palette for more in-depth color selection.

I'm glad Advanced Lumonics included both the Lamp and Palette modes, but can't say that I was terribly impressed with the latter of the two. Orbnext won't change colors as you drag your fingertip around the spectrum -- you'll need to stop and tap a separate button to actually see a change. That makes shade selection a tedious trial-and-error process. It's a small complaint, but for such a pricey little device, I wish the app felt more refined.

I also wish that the app offered more unique features. Other color-changing LED products include fun things like music syncing, multiple color cycle presets, or even the ability to create your own color cycles. Orbnext doesn't. The only cycle you get is a single arbitrary setting that fades through the same six or seven colors over and over.

The app also lacks any kind of scheduling mechanism, a basic feature that any smart lighting product should really include. Instead, Orbnext outsourced the scheduling to IFTTT. This isn't a terrible thing by any stretch -- it's easy enough to craft an IFTTT recipe that changes the color at a certain time each day. Still, IFTTT's servers tend to lag every now and then, with recipes sometimes taking an extra couple of minutes to fire. You wouldn't have that issue if scheduling was localized in the Orbnext app.

For more advanced automation controls, IFTTT offers plenty of room for creativity. As of writing this, IFTTT offers 131 different channels, 105 of which can be used to trigger an Orbnext color change. Along with the obvious smattering of social networks, you'll find useful Web tools and popular smart-home gadgets, too. If you've already bought into those sorts of gadgets and services, then Orbnext's IFTTT-powered smarts will carry some extra appeal.

In my tests, I played around with a variety of triggers, and aside from the occasional delay, found them to work more or less reliably. With IFTTT, I was able to trigger color changes by stepping in front of a  Belkin WeMo motion detector , favoriting a co-worker's tweet, cutting an under-performing wide receiver from my fantasy football team, parking my car at the office, and placing coins into the  Quirky Porkfolio  smart piggy bank.

Obviously, some triggers are far more practical than others, but the point is that the Orbnext IFTTT channel works, and works well enough that you can rely on it for all but the most urgent notification needs.

Orbnext is a clear smart home novelty, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. If it appeals to your tastes, I wouldn't fault you for wanting one -- but I'd advise you to consider the alternatives before spending the $129.

Color-changing smart bulbs like  Lifx  and  Tabu's Lumen LED  cost a lot less, and offer much of the same niche appeal, along with a level of general household lighting functionality that you won't get with Orbnext. If IFTTT is what's important to you, the $199 three-bulb  Philips Hue Starter Pack  might also be a worthier investment. For most with an interest in this sort of thing -- though certainly not all -- I have to think that one of those would be a better choice."
Belkin WeMo LED Lighting Starter Set review: (mwc75)|"

That price cut likely stems from new rivals that have emerged during Belkin's delay -- most notably the similarly priced white-light  Hue Lux LEDs from Philips . In that same period, we've also seen the less expensive, US-only  Connected by TCP LEDs  integrate with  SmartThings  and  Wink , upping their appeal even further. With competition like that, Belkin might have missed its chance to get out in front of the pack.

Still, there's a lot to like about these lights, especially if you've already bought into the WeMo family of  switches  and  smart devices . Like the Hue Lux LEDs, the WeMo bulbs are IFTTT-compatible and boast a full suite of well-designed, easy-to-use app controls. Smarts aside, they're highly efficient and stronger than Philips or TCP when it comes to color rendering. With those sorts of specs, Belkin's smart bulbs are certainly better late than never.

Belkin didn't go out of its way to make its LEDs stand out from the crowd. With a traditional A19 shape and a white-bodied base, they follow a trend we've seen other LEDs tack recently, with space-age looks eschewed in favor of less-conspicuous builds.

The starter kit will set you up with two bulbs and the WeMo Link that you'll need in order to control them. While the LEDs aren't available in the UK yet, other WeMo products are. That $100 price point for the starter set converts roughly to a little over £60.

In Australia it's a little more expensive -- AU$169.95 for the two bulb starter kit or AU$49.95 for each individual bulb.

The WeMo Link is a small plug-in device that's just slightly larger than a typical phone charger. The plug will receive data over Wi-Fi (such as you turning the lights on from the WeMo app), then relay it to the bulbs via ZigBee, the same standard used by Philips Hue and Hue Lux LEDs.

Those Philips bulbs, however, require you to plug a hub directly into your router. That can lead to clutter on the router shelf and fierce competition for those Ethernet jacks, something we've certainly experienced here at CNET Appliances HQ. I much prefer Belkin's approach, which lets you plug the Link in wherever you like.

Like we've found with other WeMo products, getting started is relatively simple. After plugging the Link in, it'll flash green and orange. Pull out your smartphone and you'll be able to join up with the Link's Wi-Fi network. Once you do, screw in the bulbs, turn them on, and open the WeMo app. It'll detect your bulbs automatically then pop you back onto your home Wi-Fi network, and you'll be ready to go.

If you're already using WeMo products like the  WeMo Light Switch  or the  WeMo Switch + Motion , you'll be able to control your bulbs right alongside them in the WeMo app. This includes rule creation, which means you'll be able to do things like turn your lights on by triggering WeMo's motion detector.

Back to the bulbs, though. At a power draw of 9.5 watts, and with a light output of 800 lumens, they're slightly more efficient than the competition. Belkin also settled on a color temperature of 3,000 K, just slightly hotter and less yellowy than the 2,700 K light put out by Philips and TCP.

The bulbs are also fully dimmable through the WeMo app -- though you'll want to be sure not to use them with in-wall dimmer-switch setups, as the two dimming mechanisms will clash, causing terrible flickering. In the app, though, dimming is smooth, simple, and flicker-free, with a slider bar that lets you dial the light up from 0 to 100 percent in 1 percent increments.

In front of our spectrometer, we detected increasing levels of light at each and every percentage point. That's an especially nice level of dimming control if you're picky about the brightness of your bulbs. My only complaint: that minimum, 1 percent level of brightness puts out about 4 percent of the bulb's total light output. That's probably plenty low for most purposes, but both Philips and TCP can dial down even lower.

One of the WeMo LED's strongest specs is its color-rendering score, which averages out to 88 out of 100. Most 60W replacement LEDs will struggle with red tones, and sit at an average score right around 80, which is where you'll find both the Philips Hue Lux LED and the Connected by TCP LED.

At 88, the WeMo LED can claim to make the colors in your home look noticeably more vivid and accurate than those two will -- though it won't do quite as good a job as bulbs that score in the nineties, like the  Cree TW Series LED  or the Editors' Choice-winning  GE Reveal LED floodlight .

Light-bulb nerdery aside, what you're paying for with WeMo LEDs are the smarts. As automatable LEDs go, they're a good option, with plenty of subtle features packed into the WeMo app.

These include the expected remote controls and scheduling capabilities. If you want your lights to turn on at 8:00 AM each morning -- or at sunrise -- the WeMo app makes it easy. Additionally, you can program fades into your lighting schedules, letting you set the lights to gradually fade on over a minute, an hour, or anything in between. You can also tell the lights to slowly fade down by pressing the ""Go to sleep"" button.

In my home, I use Connected by TCP bulbs to wake up in the morning, but the app doesn't offer an easy mechanism for slow, customized fades, or a quick sleep mode. Of the two, WeMo looks like the more feature-rich smart lighting setup.

Something else that WeMo has over TCP is an IFTTT channel, as Philips does for its Hue Lux LEDs. With IFTTT's simple ""if this, then that"" approach to automation, you'll be able to plug your WeMo LEDs in as the ""then that,"" then choose the ""if this"" from a lengthy list of Web services and smart home devices. That means you'll be able to trigger your lighting using things like iOS location, Jawbone UP24, and even Facebook posts and Foursquare check-ins, if you're so inclined.

Belkin's team tells us that the WeMo LED's IFTTT channel won't be ready immediately at the product's launch, though they're hoping to go live as soon as possible. Once it's up and running, I'll test it out and update this review accordingly -- watch this space.

As mentioned before, the WeMo app makes a cinch out of setup. Like with most recent smart home apps, you'll find a handy series of start-up screens to walk you through the process. Within a few minutes, you should be up and running.

I enjoyed using the WeMo app as I tested the kit out. Belkin has been refining the WeMo ecosystem for about a year now, and it shows -- the app feels polished and well thought-out. Features are easy to find and easy to use, with a simple rule creation interface and the ability to see the status of all of your devices at a quick glance. My scheduled lighting changes always went off without a hitch, and remote controls were quick and responsive, even when I tried controlling the lights from beyond the home Wi-Fi network.

All that said, those app controls are all that you get. There's no physical WeMo remote to compete with TCP's low-cost remote or the pricier  Philips Hue Tap , and Belkin doesn't offer a Web interface for controlling your lights and devices, either. With Philips Hue LEDs, you'll find plenty of third-party Web control interfaces, thanks to an open API. TCP offers a Web interface too, though you have to be on your home network in order to use it.

The WeMo LEDs look well-positioned to enjoy the same third-party integrations as previous WeMo devices. Aside from IFTTT, the list includes compatibility with platforms like SmartThings and Revolv, though not Wink or Staples Connect. The well-established Philips Hue brand covers all of these bases and more, while TCP bulbs are only compatible with Wink and SmartThings.

No matter which smart LED you go with, you're going to have plenty of third-party options to sync up with, but if you've got a specific third-party platform or device in mind, you'll definitely want to make sure and check for compatibility.

Overall, all three look like viable smart home options to me. If IFTTT interests you, then both WeMo and Philips Hue Lux will get you there for the same price. With WeMo, you've got direct compatibility with WeMo Switches and motion sensors -- with Philips Hue Lux, it's the potential to splurge and add a few of the original, color-changing Hue LEDs to your setup. If one of those sounds more appealing to you, I say let it tip the scale in your buying decision.

Adding smart bulbs into the WeMo ecosystem seems like a bit of a no-brainer to me, so I'm glad that WeMo LEDs are finally here. As smart bulbs go, they're a very solid, very functional option. Existing WeMo users will be especially happy should they choose to upgrade their Belkin-powered smart home with new, matching LEDs.

Still, as fast as both the smart home and LED markets are moving, I'll bet Belkin wishes it had gotten here a bit sooner. Competition is ramping up on both fronts, and costs are coming down. With  Philips Hue Lux  already established,  Connected by TCP  bulbs getting smarter, and new, ultra-affordable  GE Link LEDs  just arriving to market, competing now is going to be a whole lot tougher than it would have been five or six months ago."
Oplink Connected Video C2 review: (hu3g4)|"

Oplink's $300 Connected Video C2 kit comes with two Wi-Fi-enabled cameras, a 16GB flash drive, and the Oplink Processing Unit (OPU), which is just Oplink's fancy term for its router-connected hub. Considering that DIY cameras like the  Samsung SmartCam HD Pro  and the  Dropcam Pro  sell for roughly $200 a pop, this security system seemed like a pretty good value...at first.

I like that you can use the flash drive for local storage, but you'll still have to bring cloud-based data transfer into the mix if you want to view any saved clips on your phone -- and it will set you back $20 per month. Yes, this service is optional, but many brands offer cloud storage and remote access to video clips for much less. Icontrol's $200  Piper security system  lets you save and review up to 1,000 clips at no extra charge, and  Arcsoft's $150 Simplicam  fees start at just $5 per month.





Oplink's 640x480 resolution is also a bit of a letdown, since other budget cameras, like  Belkin's $130 NetCam HD+ , boast at least 1,280x720. And, while the brand offers various accessories you can add to the Connected Video system, there's still no word on an IFTTT channel or compatibility with third-party devices.

Steer clear of this system if you want to review clips on your phone; otherwise, it's a decent bargain kit for local-storage-only folks looking to buy more than one camera.

The Oplink hub and corresponding Wi-Fi cameras are finished in glossy white plastic -- a popular, if not slightly boring choice for today's connected cameras. The free Oplink Connected app is available on Android, iOS, and Windows devices; it will walk you through setting up your OPU hub, cameras, and other related Oplink accessories.

Installation was fairly simple -- plug the flash drive into the OPU, use the included Ethernet cable to connect the OPU to the router, plug in the power adapter, and make sure DHCP is enabled on your router (most default to this setting, but if yours doesn't you'll have to follow along with the user's guide to get things going).

Now, you're ready to set up the cameras. The instructions tell you to plug them in within 5 feet of the location of the router. This is a bit of a pain, but they're just trying to secure a Wi-Fi connection and you can move them again after the initial setup. When the bottom LED indicator blinks green, you know you're in business -- now you can unplug the cameras and relocate them as needed.

Oplink also sent me a bunch of devices to test its home automation and security add-ons. The accessories included a siren, a door/window sensor, a key fob, a water leak detector, a motion sensor, and a smart plug. This setup was a bit more complicated, as the app asked me to scan the QR code on the device to pair it, but that only worked on one of the devices.

The backup plan involved typing in a long, custom alphanumeric code that was printed in a very tiny font on each accessory. My less-than-perfect eyesight definitely struggled on this step each time, but, I managed to get everything up and running in about 30 minutes.

Since the two cameras are at the core of this Connected Video system, here's a chart comparing Oplink's cameras to other DIY options:

Not so good. Yes, you're getting two cameras for $300, but they have 640x480-pixel resolutions, no sound alerts, no two-way audio, and 66-degree fields of view. The local storage flash drive will be a definite plus for some, but, when you realize that you have to shell out $20 per month (a whopping $240 per year) to see your video clips on your phone, Oplink's Connected Video kit quickly loses appeal.

Features aside, I'm also curious about the true value of this kit. Amazon is currently selling Oplink's Wi-Fi cameras for $80 each, so that covers roughly $160 of the $300 kit -- does that mean that the compulsory OPU hub and 16GB flash drive cover the remaining $140?

That sure seems strange, especially when you consider that the $370  Oplink TripleShield security system  comes with the same hub, the same two Wi-Fi cameras, and a bunch of those optional accessories that aren't included in this $300 kit. Hm.

If you don't want to view clips on the app, you can still stream live footage and access snapshots (rather than video) when a security event is triggered, but anyone interested in accessing clips remotely won't enjoy any added convenience from Oplink's local storage solution.

Samsung's $190 SmartCam HD Pro might cost more up front, but it offers better video quality, a larger field of view (nearly double the Oplink cameras), and added features like two-way talk. And, it relies on microSD cards (up to 64GB) rather than flash drives.

Despite Oplink's disappointing specs, the cameras and added accessories performed well. I was able to view live video in the app's video section, turn the Oplink smart plug-connected lamp on and off in the app's automation section; set the system to arm, disarm, or away in the app's mode section; and review saved clips in the app's VideoGram section.

Whenever the motion sensor-equipped cameras or separate motion and door/window sensors accessories detected activity, the cameras recorded 30-second clips and stored them for later review. You can also opt in or out of push notifications and email alerts, and you can adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensors as needed. I set the cameras to the highest possible sensitivity and received alerts around the clock.

In addition to being able to watch clips on your phone, the $20 monthly fee lets you extend app access to other people and let emergency contacts receive alerts whenever a potential security breach takes place.

While the video quality was lower than some of the other cameras I've tested, its 480p resolution wasn't particularly bad. I didn't experience any major lag times or notice any significant blotchiness or other video streaming unpleasantness. I did find the auto-night vision feature odd, though.

Most systems let you set your mode preference to automatic or manual. This one doesn't have a manual setting and defaulted to night vision at irregular times, even when all of the lights were on in the office. Still, the picture was decent in both day and night mode, and the wonky night vision didn't significantly impact overall performance.

Given that the Oplink Connected Video system doesn't have competitive camera specs, costs $20 per month for a mobile access to video clips, and presents a worse value than the brand's own $370  TripleShield  system, it's pretty hard to recommend this kit. If you don't plan to review clips on your phone and want a budget, multi-camera system, it will get the job done. Still, I'd spring for Samsung's $190 SmartCam HD Pro if you can. Its video quality, features, and SD card storage trump Oplink's Connected Video kit at every turn."
D-Link dishes out a new budget Wi-Fi Smart Plug (zqa51)|"

We weren't particularly impressed with the $50  D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug  (model number DSP-W215) that we reviewed earlier this year. Its setup was complicated and I had to reinstall the app every time it was unplugged. It also didn't have an accompanying IFTTT channel or a particularly intuitive app -- two major no-no's in the smart home sector.

But now D-Link is back with a new $40 Wi-Fi Smart Plug (model number DSP-W110) that might just be an improvement over its clunky predecessor.

If the pricier DSP-W215, which keeps track of power consumption and has a sensor that shuts off overheating appliances, is in direct competition with  Belkin's $60 WeMo Insight Switch , D-Link's new $40 plug is closer to the $50  Belkin WeMo Switch  in terms of features.

So, while you won't be able to check your energy usage with this plug, you will still be able to turn your gadgets on and off remotely and set recurring schedules on the related app. D-Link's new plug has also undergone a clear design overhaul -- a definite upgrade over the more utilitarian-looking DSP-W215.

Since D-Link's new Wi-Fi Smart Plug works on the same Mydlink app, and IFTTT isn't mentioned in the official press release, it doesn't seem that this new plug is a huge departure from its previous iteration. Still, it should round out the brand's smart plug offerings and make it more competitive with Belkin and Wi-Fi plug startups such as  SensePlug.io .

The $40 D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug is available today on the D-Link site and on Amazon. We've asked D-Link to send us their new plug, so expect to hear more details on the DSP-W110 soon."
Fibaro smart home eyes US market with distinctive sci-fi looks (nl2e3)|"

Make way for another smart home kit. This time it's a solution from Fibaro that has its eye on the burgeoning connected-home market. Complete with sensors for motion, lighting, temperature, even water, the Fibaro system not only looks distinctive, it promises quite a bit of sophistication for your household as well.

To be clear, the folks behind the Fibaro connected home products, Poland-based Fibar group, didn't offer a lot of specifics outside of glossy brochures and an equally vague website. Even so, that didn't stop Fibaro representatives from extolling the smart-home virtues of its creation at the CEDIA 2014 tradeshow in Denver, Colo. While availability outside of the US might happen by the end of 2014, pricing for Fibaro in other markets wasn't outlined.

The most striking attribute of Fibaro is an ocular-shaped motion sensor for $60 (converts to about £40, or AU$67) which has a distinctly feline, almost alien look to it. In fact, the thing could almost be a stand-in for the Eye of Sauron from ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. And this gadget does promise to see a great deal. According to Fibaro the device packs sensors to detect light, temperature, plus has an accelerometer for good measure. Users, say Fibaro, can also configure the motion sensor's eye to glow in different colors depending on changes in environment it notices.

Other parts of Fibaro puzzle include a wall plug  to hook up lamps and similar electrical appliances. Also nice are the adapter's USB charger and power-monitoring function to get a handle on what attached appliances are really costing in terms of your utility bill. A fire and smoke detector add-on, plus a flood sensor (all set to cost $60; converted about £40 or AU$67) are also planned, along with door and window sensors (both to be priced at $50; converted about £30 or AU$55) targeted at the security-minded.

At the heart of Fibaro is a $750 Home Center 2 hub (converts to about £460 or AU$830) which leans on the Z-Wave protocol to speak to Fibaro's numerous wireless parts. This is a steep price to be sure, but Fibaro says the device is robust enough to command every smart product in your home, including lights, blinds, cameras, thermostats, and HVAC equipment. If this is too rich for your blood, Fibaro also plans to sell a Home Center Lite hub for $280 (about £300 or AU$530 converted), though it's not clear how its functionality differs from its more expensive sibling other than it handles ""multimedia systems.""

Other details remain murky for the moment, but check back for pricing and release information as it becomes available."
Mipow's Playbulb Candle corners the market on LED ambiance (lklj8)|"

Mipow is known for its Bluetooth-enabled mobile accessories, but it has recently made a foray into the wild world of LED lighting. Merging its two areas of focus, it initially unveiled Playbulb, an LED bulb-and-speaker-in-one. Now, it's in the midst of a Kickstarter campaign for a new lighting product, the Playbulb Candle.

The Playbulb Candle can't play music like its speaker-equipped cousin, but it does have color-changing and white-light LEDs that emit a max of 4 lumens -- roughly comparable to soft candlelight. Mipow's complimentary Android and iOS apps let you tweak your Playbulb Candle's color, brightness, and more when you're within its 33-foot Bluetooth range.

The app works with Bluetooth-4.0-equipped devices, including  Android 4.3 or later, iPhone 4S or later, iPad 3 or later, and iPod fifth generation or later. The Candle runs on three AA batteries and Mipow says setup is as simple as adding the AAs, turning the Candle on, downloading the Playbulb X app on your device of choice, and following the instructions to get things going.

You can adjust your Playbulb Candles individually or in groups. While you can technically group an unlimited number of Candles, Mipow suggests an upper limit of five for optimal performance. Every Candle is supposed to last for about 240 hours (running for 4 hours a day for 60 days) before needing new batteries and you can set a timer on the app to automate its on/off functions.

If you do want to turn it on or off in person, you can either use the built-in switch or blow on it. Yep, Mipow wanted its Candles to be as close to the real thing as possible. So, it added some sort of fancy sensor magic that lets you blow on it like a regular ol' candle to turn it off, but also, interestingly, to turn it back on again. I've reached out to Mipow for more details on this curious feature.

Playbulb Candles are rated for indoor and outdoor use, give off a lavender scent, and, when flipped over, can be used as actual candle holders.

We haven't seen anything else quite like the Playbulb Candle.  Tabu's color-changing LuMini  comes somewhat close, but it doesn't have white-light properties and is a traditional bulb rather than a separate, battery-powered device. Still, both definitely tend toward the more fun, novel side of LED lighting.

Playbulb Candle pledge prices start at just $12 (roughly £7.40 and AU$13.15) a pop and go up to $99 (roughly £61 and AU$108.60) or more for a pack of nine. Though the original goal of $5,000 has already been exceeded, the campaign runs until October 2, and Mipow expects to start shipping its colorful nightlight/accent lights to backers in October."
Quirky Porkfolio review: (3i9v3)|"

""The Internet of Things"" is an admittedly broad term, so I suppose we shouldn't be too surprised to see a connected piggy bank. That's exactly the ""Thing"" that Quirky's offering with the Porkfolio: a smart, Wi-Fi-enabled coin collector capable of tracking your savings on your phone. It even has its own channel on IFTTT.

If you just rolled your eyes or breathed a heavy sigh, I hear you. The $50 Porkfolio certainly seems less like a smart home necessity than a solution in search of a problem. And yet, unlike the equally unnecessary  Quirky Egg Minder , the Porkfolio takes its frivolity in stride. There's just enough charm and basic usefulness packed into this pig to keep you more or less happy with it -- and it carries some unique, kid-friendly appeal, too. If you're looking for a lighthearted smart-home novelty for your 7-year-old nephew (or perhaps your inner 7-year-old), I think you could honestly do a whole lot worse than this.

If the Porkfolio's cute design doesn't immediately win you over, give it some time. The blunt-nosed guy has been sitting on my desk at work for about a week now, staring at me with dimpled eyes even as I type this sentence, and I have to admit: I've grown a little fond of the thing. I know, I know. A year spent critiquing repetitive stainless steel designs and boring, white-plastic-bodied gadgets has made me particularly susceptible to a little pink porker with a few ounces' worth of personality.

If pink isn't to your tastes, the Porkfolio also comes in white or black. All three versions are made from thick, rubbery plastic, making it feel very much like a toy. As a smart-home gadget geared towards kids, that's a design choice that makes plenty of sense. To this end, you can even rotate the head and the limbs, which switches the pig between lying on its back and sprawling out on its belly.

To get started with the Porkfolio, you'll need to download the free Wink app to your Android or iOS device, then follow the onscreen instructions. If you don't have a  Wink Hub , don't worry -- you don't need one in order to use the Porkfolio.

You'll pull a tab inside the Porkfolio's belly to activate a built-in battery. The pig's nose will begin to flash (it also lights up for every coin you deposit). When prompted in the app, you'll touch the nose to your phone's screen. The screen will flash a code at the Porkfolio, telling it your Wi-Fi information, and voila, you'll have  connected your piggy bank to the cloud.

That's the same connection trick that Quirky uses for other Wink-powered products, including the  Quirky Aros , the  Quirky Pivot Power Genius , and the  Quirky Spotter . For the most part, it's a pretty easy way of getting things synced up, although on occasion, I've needed to flash my phone at my device more than once to get it to work.

From there, this smart piggy bank works more or less like any other piggy bank -- you put coins in the slot, and it hangs onto them until you're ready to take them out and dash off to the nearest bank or Coinstar machine. The difference, of course, is that you'll be able to track just how much coin you've collected in the Wink app.

As we've noted in earlier reviews, Wink has one of the better-looking smart home apps we've come across. The design is fun, playful, and befitting a product like the Porkfolio. Front and center is the piggy's face (he'll wiggle his nose a bit and blink at you, which is a nice little touch). Tap his nose, and you'll be able to change the colors that shine whenever you deposit a coin.

Above the image of the pig's face, you'll see how your stash totals up. Below, you'll be able to set a savings goal and graph your progress. You'll also be able to tell the Porkfolio how much you're taking out whenever you make a withdrawal, which you'll need to do if you want to keep the total accurate.

The Porkfolio tracks your savings using a clever, spring-loaded mechanism in the top slot. Push a coin through, and it'll push the spring out of the way. This lets the Porkfolio know how big the coin is, which is how it figures out what sort of coin you're putting in.

For the most part, this works perfectly well. In my tests, there was never more than a second or so between putting a coin in and seeing the total go up in the app. Still, it isn't foolproof. Put a coin in at an angle, or push it a few extra millimeters against the spring by mistake, and you might fool the Porkfolio into thinking it's bigger than it actually is. I was repeatedly able to trick it into thinking a penny was a nickel, for instance, although I needed to make a conscious effort to do so.

Another problem with this design is that the Porkfolio can only handle one coin at a time. Slide two coins in side-by-side, and the spring mechanism will only read it as a single coin. This gets tedious if you're transferring an entire jar's worth of quarters into the thing, but for the most part, it's a small quibble.

To get to your loot, you'll remove a plug on the bottom of the bank. Inside, there's an annoyingly inclined ridge around the rim of the opening that keeps the coins from falling out naturally, so you'll need to do a fair deal of shaking to get them out, and probably fish around with your finger for those last few pennies.

Aside from tracking how much money you're putting into it, the Porkfolio will alert you when it's running low on batteries. You can also set it to alert you if someone moves the bank, or if it gets flipped upside down. I couldn't get the movement alerts to work at all, but the upside down alerts came through like clockwork each and every time.

Upside-down alerts might sound like a rather pointless feature, but I could see it coming in handy as a sneaky way for parents to know if their kid is jumping the gun on their nest egg, or perhaps as a means for the kid in question to catch a thieving sibling red-handed.

I also enjoyed the way the nose lit up whenever I put a coin in, and appreciated that I could customize the color of the light in the app. You can't program the lights in any other way, though, and that seems like a wasted opportunity. For instance, why not have the lights change to green after surpassing a savings goal? To red when the battery is low?

Another strange omission is that the Wink app won't notify you when you've hit your savings goal. An automatic congratulatory alert seems like a no-brainer, but you won't get anything of the sort. Instead, you're forced to turn to the Porkfolio's IFTTT channel, and while it's easy to enough to program an IFTTT alert on your phone or elsewhere whenever your balance rises above a certain point, this still feels like a feature that belongs in the Wink app itself.

Speaking of that IFTTT channel, it's a little bit sparse, which isn't surprising considering that we're talking about a piggy bank. You'll have access to two ""If This"" triggers: ""money added"" and ""balance rises above."" Both of these are just what they sound like -- the first triggers your action of choice whenever you deposit a coin, the second triggers an action once you've cleared a certain balance.

The balance trigger makes sense for the aforementioned time-to-raid-the-piggy-bank-and-go-buy-a-video-game alert, but the money added trigger seems less useful. I suppose you could set up a recipe to let you know how high your balance has risen whenever you deposit coins, but the constant stream of updates seems like it would get old fast -- and besides, isn't that what the app is for?

Frivolity is forgivable if the product in question doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's probably the most important thing the Porkfolio gets right. It isn't trying to be a smart-home game changer. It's just a place to put your coins that's slightly more functional -- and slightly more fun -- than that old mason jar you keep on top of your dresser.

Absolutely no one needs a Porkfolio -- but I couldn't blame you for being charmed into wanting one. At $50 (or less if you can catch it on sale, which doesn't seem particularly difficult to do), it isn't a purchase that'll sting too badly at checkout. Most importantly, it's just fun enough to warrant regular use, which might make it a good way to teach an app-savvy kid about budgeting and saving -- or a good way to keep you collecting loose change until you can afford to splurge on some other silly gadget."
Philips brings smart LEDs to new Hue Beyond light fixtures (gu6xh)|"

Where Philips'  Hue Connected Bulbs  gave you individual LEDs to add to any traditional socket, the company's new Hue Beyond series, announced today, integrate the Dutch company's smart LED tech directly into a set of hard-wired, expensive light fixtures.

Starting at £299 for a table lamp with no connectivity hub (for those who already own one), and going all the way up to £529 for either a pendant or ceiling fixture kit, these lamps are for the well-off smart home enthusiast. US and Australia prices have yet to be announced, but those prices convert to $495-$875 and AU$530-AU$940.

They also make gimmicky colored LEDs seem a little less obtrusive. Unlike the Hue Connected Bulbs, the Hue Beyond lamps all have the LEDs built directly into them. There's no bulb to change, and once you experience dimming (only likely after 15,000 hours/15 years of use, says Philips) or a wonky diode, you have to live with it. Yes, Hue Beyond lamps bring with them some risk. You also have to like the design.

The technical appeal of the Beyond line is that each fixture includes two banks of LEDs, one in the top shade, and one in the bottom, and you can control them independently via Philips Hue iOS and Android apps.

Each bank offers the same degree of programmability as the standard Hue Connected bulbs, and the Beyond series is also compatible with the existing Hue network. That means that alongside any Hue bulbs you already have, you can program each set of Hue Beyond  LEDs to display one of over 16 million RGB colors, as well as the full spectrum of orange-to-blue white typical of traditional incandescent bulbs. You can also tell them to perform certain automated behaviors.

Imagine using the bottom-most LEDs as a reading light, and programming the top portion to flash red  when you have a new email, or when a loved one arrives at a certain location. Because the Hue Beyond works with the  IFTTT  service as well as various smart home hubs like  Revolv  and  SmartThings , you can tie the lamps' behavior to an ever-growing network of smart home devices and online services.

Given the smartphone-centric control schemes common to many connected home devices, it's refreshing for a product to introduce features, in this case color-coded notifications, that can help us untether ourselves from our various mobile products.

Philips promises the same color rendering quality, 600-lumen output (1,200 lumens for the pendant and ceiling light), and longevity for the Hue Beyond fixtures as for the standalone Hue LEDs. They hit the UK's Selfridges department stores this month, with retail availability coming to the US and the rest of the world at some unspecified future date. We hope to have some hands-on time shortly here at IFA, and we'll update accordingly."
Cree BR30 LED review: (f2y04)|"

North Carolina-based industrial lighting manufacturer Cree has only been selling residential LED light bulbs for a year and a half, but that hasn't stopped it from establishing itself as a brand to be reckoned with. The  	 40W and 60W replacement LEDs  that served as the company's debut bulbs quickly became bestsellers in the lighting aisle, thanks to aggressive pricing and a generous 10-year warranty.

Cree took a similar approach with the next bulb they released, a BR30 floodlight LED. At a time when LEDs were still essentially priced as luxuries, the Cree BR30 came in right under $20 -- still far pricier than incandescents, halogens, and CFLs, but reasonable enough to spur sales all the same.

Now, over a year later, the lighting landscape has changed, with new competitors filling the shelves and prices falling to their most affordable levels yet. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is Cree's BR30 -- and neither has its $20 price tag. With intriguing LED alternatives like the  	 Philips SlimStyle BR30  and even superior ones like the  GE Reveal BR30  available for less, Cree might be behind the market here, an unusual position for the LED upstart. Until they catch up, buying the company's flagship floodlight just doesn't make much sense.

Aside from its shape, the Cree BR30 LED doesn't differ much from the design of the original Cree LEDs. Take a cursory look at the bulb, and you'll find the same white body with the Cree logo, those same, fin-like heat sinks around the bulb's collar, and the same rubbery coating over the glass.

Designed to replace 65W incandescent floodlights of the same shape, the Cree BR30 LED puts out 650 lumens worth of light, with anything over 600 lumens being sufficient. That light shines out at the same, golden-hued 2,700 K as the original Cree LEDs using a stated power draw of 9.5 watts.

On paper, these are all perfectly good specs for this sort of bulb. That 9.5-watt power draw gives it an efficiency rating of 68 lumens per watt, same as the Philips SlimStyle BR30 and slightly less than the Philips WarmGlow BR30, which puts out 77 lumens per watt.

Another nice spec is that 10-year warranty, which Cree wisely extended across its entire portfolio of consumer LED offerings. For a time, that 10-year figure was unmatched in the industry, and managed to provide some reassurance to LED longevity skeptics. Now, however, we're starting to see other major manufacturers like GE taking Cree's cue, with decade-long warranties of their own.

In front of our spectrometer, the Cree BR30 LED performed very well. That 650-lumen figure looks to be more or less right on the money, as we were able to rate it right around 655. The color temperature was also quite accurate, falling just ten degrees shy of that 2,700 K target.

In terms of color rendering, the Cree doesn't promise anything higher than average LED performance, with a CRI score of 81. This score, an average of several scores that represent how accurately the bulb illuminates specific shades, includes the same low score on reds that we've seen with other Cree bulbs, something that holds it back a bit when it comes to color accuracy.

To test this out, we set out a colorful photo shoot, lighting each setup with each of the LED floodlights we tested. With its boosted color rendering score, the GE Reveal was the clear winner, with the Philips WarmGlow, the Philips SlimStyle, and the Cree BR30 finishing more or less tied for a distant second. To judge the results for yourself be sure and check out  our full gallery of color rendering comparison shots.

Color rendering can be a pretty subtle thing, and in fairness, many people prefer a more golden glow, even if it tends to yellow things out somewhat. Still, the GE Reveal can claim to be noticeably better with colors -- and it costs less than Cree's floodlight, too.

Dimmability is another big factor worth considering when you're upgrading your light bulbs. Many of today's bulbs, if not most of them, claim to be dimmable -- but some are better at it than others.

In Cree's case, that dimming performance left a bit to be desired. While Cree's floodlight proved dimmable with every switch in our tests, it also failed to dim down quite as low as the other bulbs we tested, cutting out to black at right around 8 percent of its maximum brightness. Another subtle difference, to be sure, but still one worth noting if you're picky about dimmable light.

We also detected a fair amount of flicker as we dialed the light up and down, especially at around half brightness, where fluctuations caused by the dimmer switch rapidly cycling the power on and off tend to cause the most interference. On the bright side, the Cree BR30 didn't buzz noticeably on any of the dimmers.

In fairness, the GIF above exaggerates the flicker problem to a certain extent (there's really no good way to accurately show you what flicker looks like in a picture or video). Still, compared to the GE Reveal, which aced our flicker tests (and produced one of the more boring GIFs we've ever put together), the Cree seems like the lesser option.

One last performance-based point of consideration is how well the bulb's manage heat. Like most electronics, LEDs will produce a small amount of heat, and just like a laptop or a phone, they'll see their performance suffer if they don't do a good job managing it.

This separates LEDs from other kinds of light bulbs, and is the reason why they're typically designed with heat sinks, like the ones around the neck of the Cree BR30. When the bulb first gets turned on, it will see a slight, barely noticeable dip in brightness as things heat up, but then, thanks to those heat sinks, things will plateau out into what manufacturers call the ""steady state,"" which is where the bulbs get rated for things like lumen output and efficiency.

With the Cree BR30 LED, that steady state sits at about 88 percent of the initial brightness, which isn't a bad number in and of itself. However, every other floodlight we tested did better, especially the GE Reveal, which flatlined at closer to 95 percent. If I was choosing a bulb to use in an enclosed fixture, where heat buildup is a greater concern, I'd be inclined to go with a light like that as opposed to the Cree BR30.

In the end, the Cree BR30 LED certainly isn't a bad bulb. It boasts good efficiency specs, an appealing warranty, and suitable performance for everyday household use. It does a perfectly acceptable job -- but so do other LED floodlights, like the  Philips SlimStyle BR30 , which costs just $13. The Editors' Choice  GE Reveal BR30 LED  does an undeniably better job than Cree -- and even that bulb costs a little bit less.

Cree remains a very solid brand with many appealing LEDs. I have no doubt that they'll continue to produce very decent light bulbs, and perhaps even some exceptional ones. But in the case of Cree's BR30 floodlight, the market has caught up, and the value just isn't there."
GE Reveal BR30 LED review:|"

BR30-shaped floodlights cost more than regular light bulbs, and for directional track lighting and recessed lighting setups, the chances are good that you'll be buying more than one. That means you want to be sure and invest in a quality bulb that won't leave you disappointed.

In my opinion, that bulb is the GE Reveal BR30 LED -- and it isn't all that close. Along with a distinct uptick in color quality, the GE Reveal manages heat more effectively than the competition, and also works exceptionally well with dimmer switches, a pesky sore spot with the majority of bulbs we've tested.

Best of all, with a new price point of $18 at Home Depots nationwide (or less, if you live in a region that offers rebates for Energy Star-qualified bulbs), you're getting a terrific value on a bulb that's designed to last decades, and spending even less than you will for competitors like the  Cree BR30 LED , which we weren't as impressed with. If I needed to buy a floodlight for my home, there's no question that the GE Reveal BR30 LED is the one I'd go with.

The white-bodied GE Reveal BR30 LED looks simple enough, with the same silhouette as many of the sorts of existing floodlights you might be using it to replace. Aside from the blue band at the base of the bulb, it looks no different than GE's standard BR30 LED.

Like all BR30s, the GE Reveal is designed to spread light in a single direction, unlike the omnidirectional light that you'll get with most common  	 A19 shaped bulbs. The ""BR"" in BR30 stands for bulging reflector, which simply means that any light shining at a downward angle gets reflected back up and out through the top of the bulb. This makes it the ideal bulb shape for recessed lighting setups, and for things like overhead track lighting, as well.

Like other GE Reveal bulbs, the GE Reveal BR30 LED sets itself apart from the competition with a focus on color quality that comes thanks to a design that filters out excess yellow tones. This gives it a color rendering score that's about ten points higher than the bulbs that sit next to it on the shelf -- and that means it'll make the colors in your home look more vivid and accurate.

Of course, while filtering out some of the light will improve color quality, it comes at an expense of brightness. The GE Reveal BR30 LED compensates for this by upping the wattage to get that brightness back up where it should be. This makes for a light that's slightly less efficient than other LEDs.

This is a different approach than GE has taken previously. The original, A19-shaped GE Reveal LED failed to increase the wattage, making it noticeably dimmer than competitors like the  	 Cree TW Series LED , which also promises superior color rendering capabilities. That kept me from giving it a full-throated recommendation  when I tested the two bulbs out earlier this year.

As said, the GE Reveal BR30 LED doesn't make that same mistake. With 12 watts compared to the 9 or 10 that a BR30 LED will typically draw, it will cost a few extra cents per year to use the thing, but that's quite literally a small price to pay for higher color quality. It's still highly efficient compared to the 65W incandescents it's designed to replace -- make the switch, and you'll still save an average of $6.50 in energy costs each year.

At any rate, those few extra watts in the GE Reveal keep the brightness up where you want it, which seems worth it to me. A 65W-replacement BR30 should put out at least 600 lumens, and the GE Reveal puts out 630. In our tests, we actually found that number to be a bit conservative, with our spectrometer clocking the bulb's light output at closer to 700 lumens.

Another consideration when it comes to brightness is how well a given bulb will work on a dimmer switch. Many dimmer switches will generate electromagnetic interference that causes bulbs to flicker and buzz -- and some bulbs are more susceptible than others.

The BR30 LEDs that we tested out gave us even more trouble than  the 60W replacement LEDs we tested earlier this year, with a great deal of buzz and flicker as we dialed the light levels up and down, even on dimmer switches designed specifically for use with LEDs.

However, the one exception was the GE Reveal BR30 LED. While the bulb buzzed very faintly as we dimmed it, we didn't see a noticeable flicker on any of the dimmer switches we tested out, not even on an outdated rotary dial designed for incandescent use only.

The picture above is actually an animated GIF of the GE Reveal plugged into a Leviton dimmer switch and dimmed down to fifty percent, the point at which bulbs tend to flicker the most. As you can see, the light level remains constant throughout each frame.  No other BR30 we tested came anywhere close to performance that steady.

In addition to flicker, we made sure to examine each bulb's dimmable range. All the way up, you want your bulb to shine at 100 percent of its normal brightness. At the bottom, you want to be able to get as close to zero as possible before it cuts to black.

As you can see, the GE Reveal dimmed down to just 5 percent before turning off, which was a good result, but not as low as either of the Philips bulbs we tested out. Still, unlike the GE Reveal and Cree BR30s, neither of those two bulbs dimmed all the way up to full brightness on our switches, which seems more important to me.

The main claim of the entire GE Reveal product line is that they'll render colors better than the competition. The question is whether or not it's a noticeable difference.

To find out, we set the GE Reveal in front of our spectrometer, a handy gizmo that lets us measure things like brightness, color temperature, and color-rendering scores. Most BR30 LEDs have a color rendering score around 80, but in the GE Reveal's case, that score came in just under 90. That's the same type of score as you'll see with the kinds of lights used for things like art exhibition and professional photography.

To put this score to the test, we set up a colorful milieu of fruits, flowers, and candy. With our camera's exposure settings locked in, we lit each setup with each of the BR30 LEDs we had on hand, taking photos for comparison.

In each of these tests, the GE Reveal stood out, with our producer and photographer Colin West McDonald telling me it was without question the bulb he'd want lighting his home studio. If you feel like judging for yourself, we've packed each and every shot from our BR30 color quality tests into  a handy slideshow.

The GE Reveal also excelled in our heat management tests. Unlike other types of light bulbs, LEDs will see a slight decline in performance as they heat up, just like your cell phone or your laptop. In practical terms, this means that they'll lose a bit of brightness in the first thirty minutes or so of use, then level off at what manufacturers call the ""steady state."" This steady state is where they get rated for things like brightness and efficiency, so you don't have to worry about getting short-changed on the stated specs.

A higher steady state is indicative of a bulb that does a better job with managing heat, and in the GE Reveal BR30 LED's case, it does a better job than any other bulb we've tested so far. In the graph above, that purple line represents the GE Reveal, and as you can see, it levels off after 30 minutes or so at roughly 95 percent of its initial brightness. That's a terrific result, and one that helps it outshine the competition.

The GE Reveal BR30 LED is an outstanding floodlight, and at its new price point of $18, it's an outstanding value, too. It was the unquestioned winner when we tested for color quality, heat management, and dimming performance, and it comes backed with the same 10-year warranty as the  Cree BR30 LED , which costs $2 more per bulb.

If you're looking for strictly the cheapest LED floodlight that offers acceptable performance (and if you aren't using dimmer switches), then the $13  Philips SlimStyle BR30 LED  probably merits consideration. Beyond that, I can't think of a reason why I'd recommend any BR30 over the GE Reveal. For long-term lighting that you'll love living with, it's a well-deserved Editors' Choice."
MyQ Garage review:|"

The $130 Chamberlain MyQ Garage Door Opener lets you open and close your garage door from anywhere with an Internet connection. It also grants you the ability to set custom alerts and monitor the open/closed status of your garage door.

There's a lot to like about the MyQ. Installation is simple. Broad compatibility means the MyQ should work on your current garage hardware. Chamberlain's inclusive attitude also means you can coordinate the MyQ to interact with a growing number of connected home platforms.

You'll find that interoperability to be crucial to the MyQ achieving its full potential. The basics of the MyQ all work as expected, but soon after you install it you start wondering what else it can do. What if it could learn when you're coming and going and respond automatically? Wouldn't a camera in the garage also make sense?

Between its comparatively low cost and its ease of use, the MyQ is  recommendable in that it that delivers on its core promises with little  fuss. Just be prepared to feel the itch to add more smart products once  you start using it.

The world of connected garage door openers is surprisingly broad. In addition to Chamberlain's own fixed units with built-in connectivity, it shares the same MyQ technology with sister brand Liftmaster. Sears' Craftsman also has it own line of connected openers using a tech it calls AssureLink. You'll also find at least half-a-dozen options on the retrofit market.

Those retrofit devices include GoGoGate, Garageio and others, with prices ranging from $130 for the MyQ to $180 or so. Although it's one of the least expensive devices in its class, the MyQ is also one of the easier units to install, requiring no wired connection to your existing opener.

The entire MyQ kit itself is made up of of two main hardware components; a base station that attaches to the ceiling of your garage near your current opener, and a sensor unit that adheres to the garage door.

Installation should take about 15 minutes. Start by screwing a small bracket to your garage ceiling near a power outlet (wood screws as well as drywall screws and anchors are included). Slide the base station onto the bracket, plug in the power cable, then link your phone, your wireless network, and the garage opener to the base station, via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

Go through the typical iOS or Android Bluetooth pairing process to link the devices and share your home Wi-Fi settings between your phone and the MyQ base station. That step puts the hub on the Internet, granting you access to your garage door opener from anywhere you can get online with your phone. Via the MyQ app, you then make an account and add the device via the serial number from the base unit.

Select the make and model for your opener within the app, and then follow the prompt to hit your opener's program button. Chamberlain says the MyQ is compatible with any photoelectric sensor-equipped opener made after 1993. The opener will then broadcast the open/close code for the hub to memorize. Lastly, attach the door sensor to your garage door via the included adhesive strips and hit the test button to pair the sensor to the MyQ hub.

None of these steps are terribly onerous. Yes, you'll need to get up on a ladder and drill into the ceiling of your garage (unless you mount the hub some other way). There's no need to mess with breaker switches or hard wiring the hub to anything, making it an exception in its category. It also matched the photoelectric signal to my Overhead Doors Overdrive opener on the first try.

Chamberlain also deserves credit for making the Wi-Fi receiver in the hub rather strong. My iPhone registers only one bar of Wi-Fi signal strength coming from my house to my detached garage, and sometimes it doesn't find the signal at all, but I've always been able to find the MyQ remotely and send signals to it in the two weeks or so that I've had it installed.

As easy as I found the MyQ was to install, there's no getting around the fact that it's far easier to simply reach up and hit the old-school opener clipped to the windshield visor in my car. Replacing that routine with an app isn't really the point of the MyQ, though.

Instead, the idea is that it will let you check the status of your door remotely, and then do something about it if you don't like what you see. The kids left the garage door open? Your neighbor wants to borrow or return a tool when you're not around? MyQ lets you intervene from your bedroom, the beach, or pretty much anywhere with Wi-Fi or a cellular data signal.

One usability quirk with the MyQ comes when you have multiple residents in a home. Via a custom rule I made in the app software, my MyQ unit will tell me when the door has been open for 45 minutes. My wife works at home though, so when I get an alert telling me the door is open on a workday, I'm never exactly sure where she is or what she might be doing around the house.

I'm not worried about accidentally crushing her with the door. When you tell the app to close, the MyQ base unit beeps and flashes a light for about 15 seconds before it actually starts closing. That and the opener-connected motion sensor already installed across the threshold of my garage ensure that no one will be hurt or surprised by the MyQ.

But if my wife is for some reason counting on the garage door staying in a certain state -- maybe she's taking in groceries, or playing in the driveway with our kid -- there's no way for me to see what's going on remotely via the MyQ app.

The obvious solution is to put a camera in the garage. This is how the MyQ starts you thinking about adding more devices. Fortunately it's rather good at accommodating them.

Chamberlain is keeping its options open among the various smart-home platforms out there. It's an inaugural partner of Apple's forthcoming HomeKit iOS extension. If you own a  Nest Learning Thermostat , you can use the MyQ app to set home and away status on your thermostat automatically when you open and close the door.

Chamberlain has also promised MyQ integration with the new  Wink Hub  from Quirky's Wink smart-tech spin-off. Once that comes online, you will be able to program automated behaviors between the MyQ and an assortment of other smart home products, including DropCam.

It doesn't support all home automation hubs. If you use either  SmartThings  or  Revolv , you'll either need to find a workaround, as SmartThings users have already done, or hope for official compatibility soon. You might also wish for IFTTT support, which would let you tie MyQ behavior to various other devices and online services to trigger various behaviors (""if my phone's GPS comes within 10 feet of the garage, then open the garage door"") on the MyQ, or for the MyQ to act as a trigger itself.

Those other retrofit openers offer essentially no interoperability though, so the MyQ still comes out ahead. And what of those other devices? The $150 GoGoGate has built-in support for integration with cameras from DropCam, Foscam, Insteon, and others, although it costs a reasonable $30 for a three-year subscription to the video-streaming service. Others openers from  Garageio , Securemote, and miDoor all cost $150 as well, and all of them, including GoGoGate, require some kind of direct wiring into your opener system.

That wiring step isn't the most difficult thing, but it will alienate a few people, and the MyQ and its wireless setup are there to offer an easier alternative. With few wires, the low cost, and the growing interoperability with various other smart-home systems, the Chamberlain MyQ has all of the momentum in this still-emerging device category. Watch its competitors, particularly the GoGoGate, to see if they start to play well with other smart-home products. Until they do, the Chamberlain MyQ is the smart garage-door opener I'd recommend."
Philips Hue Lux review:|"

EDITOR'S NOTE: At time of publication, this review stated that the Hue Lux LEDs drew 18 watts, while they actually draw 9. The text has been updated accordingly.

Philips Hue LEDs  come with two main draws: smart, app-enabled lighting control, and a color-changing novelty factor. However, at $60 per bulb and $200 for a three-bulb starter kit (£50 and £180 in the UK, not yet available in Australia), they're also priced too high for many consumers. Enter the new Philips Hue Lux LEDs, which cut out the colors, and also cut the cost in half.

That seems like a pretty fair deal to me. At $30 per bulb and $100 for a two-bulb starter kit (£25 and £80 in the UK, not yet available in Australia), the Lux LEDs are priced to compete with cheaper smart lighting setups like the US-only  Connected by TCP Wireless LED Lighting Kit  that offer essentially the same thing. Lux still costs a little more than those, but for the extra cash you'll be getting direct compatibility with the popular automation service IFTTT, along with an arguably more polished app experience. In my mind, that makes it a kit worth considering.

The Philips Hue Lux LEDs don't stray far from the Philips aesthetic, with the same flat-headed design that you'll see with the original Hue LEDs, along with the white-bodied build of  Philips' non-connected 60W equivalent LEDs . In this sense, they're better at blending in with your ""normal"" lights than some other smart bulbs might be (and also some  non-smart bulbs , for that matter).

Like the original Hue LEDs that came before them, the Hue Lux LEDs use Zigbee to communicate wirelessly with the Hue Bridge, which you'll need to keep plugged into your router. If you already have Hue LEDs or  Hue BR30 floodlights  and want to add Hue Lux LEDs to your setup, the existing Bridge you're using will work just fine.

The Hue app is compatible with Apple devices running iOS 6.0 or later, or on devices using Android 2.3 and up. Once you've got the app up and running, you'll be able to dim the light up and down, or schedule it to automatically turn on or off at a certain time. Activate the Philips Hue IFTTT channel, and your automation options with the Lux LED will increase even further.

You won't, however, be able to change the bulb's color or color temperature. The latter of which is called color tuning, and allows you to adjust a white light bulb from a low, yellowy color temperature to something more hot and blue.

The original Philips Hue bulbs have a full white light spectrum to play with, and it would have been a nice feature if the Lux LEDs had access to it, too, in spite of being locked out of the full RGB spectrum. Recently announced white-light connected bulbs like the  Samsung Bluetooth Smart LED  are offering color tuning or some variation of it.

Still, the Philips Hue ecosystem has been evolving for a couple of years now, which makes for a polished and satisfying user experience. The Hue's open API doesn't hurt, either, as it's helped bring about a number of third-party apps and integrations for the smart LEDs.

Among these direct integrations are popular connected home control systems like  Revolv ,  SmartThings ,  Wink , and  Staples Connect , so if you're envisioning Philips Hue as part of a larger network of smart home devices, you have a couple of ways to go about making that happen. Even without an extra hub hub, you'll be able to sync your lights up with other IFTTT-compatible devices, including  Belkin WeMo Switches ,  Jawbone Up24 , and the  Automatic smart driving assistant .

You'll also be able to use Lux LEDs with the recently released  Philips Hue Tap , a physical controller you can mount on the wall or take with you to trigger specific lighting setups at the touch of a button.

All in all, the Hue app makes for a comfortable user experience. Scheduling time-based lighting changes is as easy as setting the alarm on your phone, and comes with more customizable options than what you'll find with TCP.

As someone who detests alarm clocks, here's an example I can speak to personally. With TCP, you can program your bedroom light to turn on in the morning, but with Philips Hue Lux, you can also program it to slowly fade up over whatever length of time you like, making it a superior wake-up light for those early mornings.

However, keep in mind that the reliability of your smart lighting setup is going to depend upon the strength of your Wi-Fi network. If you have a spotty connection that cuts out a lot, your automations might not always work.

Smarts aside, the Lux LEDs put out 750 lumens from a stated 9 watts of power draw, for a very respectable 84 lumens per watt -- better on paper than the original Hue LEDs or the TCP LEDs, which both ring in right above 70 lumens per watt. However, take a closer look at the Lux's fine print, and you'll see that each bulb draws 160 milliamps at an average voltage of 120. Multiply those out, and you get a power draw that's actually closer to 19 watts.

To get to the bottom of this, we plugged the Hue Lux LED into a variable transformer to get a read on just how much power it was actually using. The numbers seemed to confirm it -- at full brightness, the bulb was consuming roughly 18 watts of power, for a disappointing efficiency rating of only 42 lumens per watt.

However, there's another variable at play when it comes to an LED's energy consumption, and that's the power factor, a figure between 0 and 1 which must be factored in when you're calculating watts. A power factor less than 1 will bring that final wattage calculation down, and in the case of the Hue Lux, it's about .55, which brings the power draw right back down to 9 watts.

Explaining the power factor can get incredibly wonky, but Osram Sylvania has an analogy that I find particularly apt:

In this case, the Hue Lux fills an ""18-watt mug,"" but only 9 watts of that is ""beer."" The other 9 watts of ""foam"" doesn't actually factor into your energy consumption.

Moving on from beer analogies, the Hue Lux is capable of dimming down smoothly to 0.5 percent of its maximum brightness before cutting out to black. That makes the Lux our current smart lighting dimming leader, edging out TCP's low score of 1.2 percent, and easily improving upon the original Philips Hue, which cuts out at 4.9 percent.

Thanks to the app-controlled dimming mechanism built right into the bulb, the Lux dims smoothly up and down, with no noticeable buzz or flicker, the same as other smart dimming LEDs we've tested. Like those other LEDs, however, you won't want to use Hue Lux bulbs with a physical dimmer switch -- the two dimming mechanisms will clash, and the light will flicker and flash uncontrollably.

Remove the color-changing novelty factor from  Philips Hue bulbs , and their inherent smarts remain pretty compelling. Those compelling smarts are exactly what Philips is offering with the Hue Lux LEDs, along with a significantly lower cost of entry than their color-changing cousins. That's a good move, and likely a welcome development for consumers who've thus far felt priced out of giving those smarts a shot. Spending $100 to try out a Hue Lux starter kit, then -- if you like the way it works -- spending another $60 to add a color-changing bulb into the setup seems like a much more reasonable approach then going all-in on a $200 color--changing starter kit.

For an option that's even more affordable, the (US-only)  Connected by TCP Wireless LED Lighting Kit  remains a solid choice at $80. It also might be worth waiting for the new (also US-only) $15  GE Link Connected LEDs  to arrive next month. Still, if you find Hue tempting, here's your most affordable way in yet."
Wink Hub review:|"

Wink has expanded from Quirky's simple app to control GE + Quirky products like the  Aros A/C unit  and the  Pivot Power Genius  to a full-fledged smart home-focused spin-off company that supports both Quirky's own products and those from outside vendors. The new, $80 Wink home automation hub is the focal point for this new company's ambition of  controlling your house.

Wink isn't the first company to try for a unifying automation platform, but its hub is definitely the most affordable and versatile option we've come across. It works with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Lutron ClearConnect, and Kidde's RF-equipped devices, and Wink's open, competitor-friendly style promises more and more product integrations to come. In comparison, the $300  Revolv Hub , the $100  Lowe Iris Hub , the $100  SmartThings Hub , and the $130  Insteon Hub  are either priced too high or have limited compatibility with third-party devices (or both).

Factor in the Wink Hub's $80 price (you can find it at Home Depot and on Amazon for $50 through Labor Day) and it becomes even more appealing. I did have trouble pairing select products, and the app isn't a perfect replacement for some of the more sophisticated standalone smart home device apps, but this low-cost hub comes pretty darn close to the whole-home security and automation ideal.

The Wink Hub is finished in glossy white plastic and comes with a built-in stand and detachable power adapter. The case plastic doesn't feel particularly durable and the hub is a bit larger than I'd like, but it isn't as distracting as Revolv's red teardrop-shaped hub. A simple LED indicator light is located on the hub to alert you to its status.

You'll need to refer to the manual to decode every LED message. When it flashes pink it means that it's disconnected from the Wi-Fi network, a flashing yellow light means that it's trying to connect to the network, and so on. The basic signaling system is no better than that of your average cable model or Wi-Fi router, and while it's not that intuitive, keeping it spare likely helps Wink keep the price down.



The Wink Hub can translate Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Lutron ClearConnect, and Kidde networking protocols. There are also a number of products that can work on the Wink app that don't need the hardware hub to communicate. Wink differentiates between these products with a sticker on the packaging that reads either ""Wink app compatible, Wink Hub required"" or ""Wink app ready, no Wink Hub required.""

Wink's current list of hub-enabled products includes Bali automated blinds, GE Link LEDs, GE Profile Series Remote Enabled Built-In Convection Wall Ovens, the Kidde 2-in-1 Wireless Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm, Kwikset SmartCode 910 Deadbolts, and an assortment of others.

Devices that only need the app include  Chamberlain's MyQ Garage Door Opener , the  Dropcam Pro , the  Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat ,  Philips Hue LEDs , and others, including existing Quirky + GE products.

To compare the breadth of support, Revolv's $300 hub has plans for seven different protocol integrations, but it currently only has Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, and Insteon procotols activated. It also has a variety of third-party partnerships, including some that Wink doesn't currently offer, like the  Nest Learning Thermostat , Sonos, Belkin WeMo products, and Yale locks, but the Revolv is also significantly more expensive.

The $130 Insteon Hub is limited to its own protocol and products. Lowe's Iris Hub costs $99 and has a variety of compatible products, but only works with Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, and ZigBee. Plus, you have to pay a $10 monthly fee to get the most from it.

SmartThings has IFTTT compatibility and is continuously adding new third-party partnerships, but it only works with Z-Wave and ZigBee-compatible devices,  and it costs $100.

The free app acts as the user interface for the hub and any other Wink-compatible products -- no Web app or other Wink Hub access points. I downloaded the app on an Asus Nexus 7 tablet and on an iPhone 5. The account holder can extend access to other users on a product-by-product basis and make updates over time, as needed.

Connecting the hub to  the app is straightforward. Simply open the app, select the hub under the product list, and follow the instructions. The instructions included plugging in the hub (the app suggests placing it at least 3 feet away from the router), enabling Bluetooth on your phone, and providing your Wi-Fi network details. Done.

Now you can add other products -- the process works in much the same way. Select a product from the list and follow the step-by-step instructions to set it up. I connected an assortment of devices:  some that needed the Wink Hub and other that could connect directly to the Wink app.

Specifically, I connected a Lutron Caseta plug-in dimmer, a Pico remote, and a Kidde 2-in-1 Wireless Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarm from the list of app-compatible, hub-required products and a Quirky + GE Aros A/C unit and a Dropcam Pro from the list of app-ready, no-hub-required devices.

I definitely had the most trouble pairing the Lutron plug-in dimmer and the corresponding Pico remote to the hub, to the extent that I had to call Wink's customer service line. A quick online search revealed that others are having similar troubles with this particular pairing.

The fix required a complex over-the-phone explanation of how to reset both the dimmer and the remote to factory settings. It involved a series of very specific rhythmic button presses on the dimmer and the remote, tough for the customer service representative to describe over the phone and akin to a middle-school music class where you have to clap out rhythms in unison.

After all of that, the interface on the Wink app was pretty basic, but then again, so is the dimmer's core functionality. You can dim the lights, turn them on, or turn them off.

The Kidde smoke and CO alarm was much simpler to connect -- I followed the steps and it worked after the first attempt. Its interface, though, isn't particularly useful. It displays a check mark next to the smoke, carbon monoxide, and battery level indicators, showing that all is well. It would be nice to have a more detailed battery-life indicator, but it works for an at-a-glance safety and maintenance check-up.

The Quirky + GE A/C unit gave me a bit of trouble. At first, I had it set up far away from the hub and experienced a series of error messages during the setup process. The steps are also a bit convoluted.



You have to share your Wi-Fi info, plug in the Aros, wait for the Aros LED indicator to blink, and then initiate a countdown on the app to a series of screen flashes. While it's counting down, you have to align your phone with a sensor on the Aros and your phone screen will begin to flash. When the flashing stops, you can remove your phone and it should connect soon after.

I made it through these steps several times only to have the app tell me it hadn't connected properly. I moved the unit closer to the hub and the router and it worked after a few additional tries. We've commented on some connectivity issues in our Quirky + GE product reviews, but it was still disappointing that the brand that the Wink app was originally designed for took so much effort to connect. Once connected, though, the Aros' app interface was very easy to use. I noticed periodic lag times, but experienced no issues otherwise.

The Dropcam Pro was the simplest device to pair. I don't like its Wink app interface as much as Dropcam's own standalone app, though. You can't change the orientation of the video display in the Wink app, limiting the viewing options considerably.

I didn't experience any major performance issues with the hub or the app (after the initial setup). It's very simply to monitor and make changes to the paired products from the app. But that's only half of what Wink can do. Beyond checking in on products individually, Wink's Cloud capability allows you to create robots and shortcuts -- two Wink Hub-specific features that let you make custom automation settings.

Robots are programmable rules that create an IFTTT-style recipe. One of the robots was an automated rule for the Dropcam Pro. When the Dropcam Pro detected motion, the Lutron Caseta dimmer-connected lamp turned on and sent me a push notification. You can set a specific schedule or let it run continuously. Some home automation systems, like the $250  Archos Smart Home Starter Pack  would require you to create two different rules here, one to turn on the lamp and another to receive a push notification.

Shortcuts are similar, but let you control multiple products at the same time with a single button press. That way, you can turn on your Aros and your Lutron dimmer-connected lamp for a ""wake-up"" setting or the reverse for a ""sleep"" setting whenever you want.

While Wink is well-positioned for home automation supremacy, it still has a lot to overcome. Larger companies like Google and Samsung are swooping into the smart-home scene and snatching up smaller, successful brands like Nest and SmartThings. We don't know what these tech giants and their new acquisitions have planned for the market, but they definitely have the resources to take on Wink, Revolv, and any other startups that cross their path.

Still, Wink has a fair shot. Its connection to Quirky and relationship with HomeDepot gives it stability and a heavily trafficked place to showcase its hub and other connected products. If Wink can match the inclusiveness of SmartThings and continue to add support for devices from Wink and its Quirky parent, any apparent kinks in Wink's line could become obscured.

Yes, the setup process can be tedious, but the early effort is worth it in the end. The $80 Wink Hub and app are a dynamic duo that make it easier than ever to connect your connected products. It's also a fantastic value when you consider that similar products cost upward of $300.

Consolidating so many different protocols, brands, and products into one universal app isn't an easy design feat, and Wink's execution is pretty elegant. Still, there's room for improvement and competitors offering a similar list of protocols and third-party integrations at a comparable price could be on the horizon. For now, though, Wink is a very good hub that manages to offer more than most of its counterparts for less."
The Eve Irrigation System hopes to make your garden perfect|"

Hop over to Kickstarter this morning and you'll see the smart gardening platform the Eve Ecosystem launched its crowd-funding campaign. Built specifically to work with the  SmartThings  home automation hub, Eve is designed as an irrigation controller that automatically adapts to the conditions of your yard. It can manage up to 16 different watering zones of your home's existing sprinkler system. You can control each zone individually from your smart phone or tablet, or let Eve do the scheduling for you. It'll process data from its moisture sensor -- called Adam -- placed in your yard, and take into account any weather info gathered by the SmartThings hub, to give your lawn the exact amount of water it needs.

Eve, the first product by Plaid Systems, will have plenty of connected capability right from launch, including  IFTTT functionality, courtesy of the existing SmartThings platform. For example, you could have your sprinklers automatically turn off whenever you open the front door, then turn back on a set amount of time later.

SmartThings, a former Kickstarter project itself, was recently acquired by  Samsung to help them grow their footprint in the ever-growing smart home market. With a bevy of motion sensors and power controls already at its disposal, SmartThings can now use Eve to expand outside of the walls of the Smart Home.

The increased profile of SmartThings caused by the Samsung deal can only help Eve with its Kickstarter campaign. The downside of Eve building its system for SmartThings is the greatly increased initial cost for interested parties who don't already own a SmartThings hub, as the Eve Irrigation system won't function without it.

On its own, the SmartThings hub costs $99. The Eve Irrigation controller will retail separately for $150, with each Adam sensor tacking on $55. Together, the two sell for $200. All prices will be consistent for Kickstarter backers and shoppers once it hits store shelves, though Plaid is offering a limited number of discount devices for those who pledge early. They plan to have the product ready to ship by March of 2015. Currently, the Eve Ecosystem is not available overseas.

Even with the cost of the SmartThings hub, Plaid's pricing for both the Eve and Adam components pits it favorably against the competition. The  Rachio Iro  functions as an irrigation controller similar to Eve. It costs $249 or $299 for an 8 zone or 16 zone capacity, with the low price matching the cost of an Eve plus a SmartThings hub.

Similar to Eve, you can use the Iro to manually control each sprinkler zone or allow it to take care of the watering schedule for you. Rachio's device connects directly to your Wi-Fi router, so it can adapt to weather information without the need for a separate hub.That said, SmartThings allows Eve's system to scale in a way that Rachio's can't match.

Each Eve controller can manage up to eight Adam sensors. Both Adam and Eve communicate with the SmartThings hub with Zigbee. Stick Adam in the ground and it'll measure air temperature and soil moisture. Each one is intended to give you accurate readings for an entire area of your yard. You can indicate what type of landscape your Adam is monitoring. The choices ranging from lawn to garden to flower bed. Plaid claims that Adam will use this information to help the zones of your yard customize how much water each area needs.

With two capacitive conductors in the part of the sensor in the dirt, Adam gets its moisture readings by sending a current back and forth and checking conductivity. These two sensors are also designed to calculate both the surface moisture and the moisture near any roots.

Rachio's system offers nothing comparable to Adam, but there are plenty of other plant sensors out there. We recently  reviewed three of them: The $80  PlantLink  from Oso Technologies, the $60  Parrot Flower Power , and the $130  Koubachi Wi-Fi Sensor . All three connect directly to dedicated apps with large plant databases so you can get customized advice for every aspect of the care-taking of a specific flower or herb.

Thus, the Adam sensor won't be the best option to care for a single plant. Both the Koubachi Sensor and the Flower Power even measure more data, but neither offer sprinkler compatibility so again, Eve's system gains the edge with scalability.

Eve's main competition in this regard could come from the similarly themed  Edyn sensor . Edyn raised money on Kickstarter for a sensor and water valve combination earlier in the year, with a combined cost of $160, but that was for backers. The retail cost will be more and hasn't been announced. Edyn also plans to ship in March of 2015. The big difference between Edyn and Eve -- Edyn's valve attaches to a hose, and the Eve controller requires a sprinkler system. Thus, deciding between the two will simply come down to whether or not you have a sprinkler system installed.

Nathan Cauffman, the founder of Plaid, has gambled that users will appreciate painting with broader strokes by specifying landscape types for an area as opposed to customizing for specific plant types in a more localized zone. Those looking for a device dedicated to a specific plant will have plenty of better options available, including generic non-connected plant sensors which can cost as little as $10. Additionally, for those without a sprinkler system Edyn will fit your needs better, while for those without a SmartThings hub, the barrier to entry with Eve will be steep.

That said, the gamble taken by Plaid is based on the idea that consumers want to have an active hand in expanding their smart home, and covering large areas with a single sensor will be a more cost efficient way to do it. Additionally, with IFTTT compatibility and software open to developers, Plaid has put the pieces in place for the Eve Ecosystem to be a great choice for gardening and smart-home enthusiasts."
Archos Smart Home Starter Pack review:|"

The $250 (£200 in the UK, Australian availability not yet announced) Archos Smart Home Starter Pack is a security and automation system that comes with an Android tablet, two cameras, two motion sensors, and two temperature and humidity sensors. Pair the accessories to the tablet using Bluetooth and set up rules like, ""If the door opens, take a photo/video,"" or ""If the indoor temperature drops below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, send me a push notification."" That's a fair number of features for an entry-level DIY kit.

Unfortunately, the system's core design doesn't make a lot of sense. The included Android ""tablet"" has the ergonomics of an alarm clock and the screen quality of same. And since it functions as the linking hub for the various accessories in the kit, it's mostly designed to stay in one place. Hobbled by the tablet, and laden with cheap-feeling accessories, this kit feels more like an attempt to cash-in on the hype surrounding the smart home. Look to SmartThings and other kits for more robust alternatives in the same price range.



Archos' Smart Home Starter Pack looks pretty nice at-a-glance. The tablet and related accessories have a white finish that's subtle enough to blend into most rooms. There's also a distinct plasticky feel to these components, causing me to question their long-term durability.

The tablet has a low-resolution 7-inch display and runs Jelly Bean (Android 4.2.2). Like other standard Android tablets, you can use it to access the internet, email, music, the Google Play App Store and so on. It also has a webcam, a light sensor, a microphone, a speaker, a temperature sensor, a microSD card slot, a Micro-USB port, a headphone jack, a reset button, and, confusingly, a built-in stand.

The build-in stand hump makes this tablet much more of a stationary home-automation hub than an easily-transportable mobile device. That means  it has the functionality of a tablet without any of the ease-of-use. And even if it didn't have that awkward stand, the other accessories pair to it via Bluetooth. In other words, if you move the tablet out of range or power it down, the related accessories won't work at all. That solidifies this ""tablet"" as a relatively permanent fixture on your coffee table or other centrally-located spot.

The kit also comes with two Mini-Cams. These round cameras measure roughly 1.5 inches and run on three CR2450 coin cell batteries each. They have a 110-degree viewing angle, a 640x480 resolution, and come with magnetic bases for easy angle positioning. Regrettably, they can't be used for live monitoring or long-term recording. Instead, you can set up rules for the cameras to take photos or video clips after a motion alert or other triggering event.

The two accelerometer-equipped Movement Tags and two temperature and humidity-sensing Weather Tags run on one CR2430 coin cell battery each. They measure roughly 1.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide by 0.5 inches deep and have adhesive backs for fast installation. The Movement Tags come with magnetic contacts that detect opening doors and windows. All of the accessories are waterproof and have a roughly 65-foot Bluetooth range.

The setup was fairly straightforward. I powered on the tablet and logged in using a Gmail account. Then, I was able to access the already-downloaded Archos Smart Home app and start pairing the accessories. The app lets you create a mirror of your accessory setup so you can monitor your house in a more systematic way. So, if you have one Weather Tag in your bedroom and the other in your living room, you can track the current temperature and humidity by room in the app, too.

Pairing the cameras, motion sensors, and weather sensors was painless. Go to the ""accessories"" section in the app, hit the plus button on the top right corner, select the product you want to add, and follow the instructions. It will tell you to push the pairing button on the accessory until the red pairing light starts to flash. Then, hit ""start"" and the app will take care of the rest.

Once all of your accessories are paired and installed, you can start creating what Archos calls ""programs."" Programs are custom rules that are structured like IFTTT recipes. I created various programs using the cameras, motion sensors, and weather sensors and they consistently worked as expected.

While I received push notifications and was able to view video footage or photos, the layout of the app was a little convoluted. The push notifications were color-coded and timestamped, but not labeled, so I could see that an event had taken place, but not what specific alert I was receiving (see middle screenshot above). Also, it felt unwieldy to scroll through the blocks of accessories to get to the one I wanted to view.

In addition to accessing this information directly on the Archos tablet, I downloaded the app on an Asus Nexus 7 tablet and on an iPhone 5. I was able to pair new accessories and create programs on the Nexus 7; The iOS app, on the other hand, is severely limited -- you can't pair devices or create programs on it at all.

The app also times out regularly -- sometimes after just a few seconds. There's also a different app connection process when you're connecting remotely and it involves a 16-digit number. It feels like Archos made this design needlessly overcomplicated.

This is especially true when you consider the competition. There are plenty of other home security and automation systems in the same relative price point that have functional Android apps with well-built accessories. Consider the US-only $230  Viper Home system .

The Viper Home Starter Kit comes with a hub, a motion sensor, and a door/window sensor. You can buy cameras, sirens, and additional accessories a la carte (the camera has a $10 monthly fee). It isn't outfitted with as many environmental sensors as this Archos system, but the app was intuitive and the accessories felt sturdy.

The $199  Piper all-in-one security system  is another interesting option. It has even more environmental sensors than this Archos kit, as well as a camera with live-monitoring capabilities, a siren, a motion detector, and a built-in Z-Wave hub. More than that, neither Viper Home nor Piper had superfluous hardware.

Archos is best known for its Android tablets, so it isn't surprising that the brand wanted to incorporate one into its smart home vision. The problem is that most home monitoring takes place on-the-go, so a tablet that can't be used as a true tablet doesn't have much use as an automation tool. That makes this system's design feel fundamentally flawed -- and overpriced when you consider that the core component doesn't really add value. In addition, the app's label-less push notifications and clumsy block layout feel hastily thrown together.

Ditching the tablet, making the accessories Wi-Fi-enabled, and updating the app could dramatically improve the system, turning it from an oddly configured kit into a solid entry-level security system. You could wait for those improvements, but you're better off just looking for a kit from another vendor."
Philips SlimStyle BR30 LED review:|"

Philips raised plenty of eyebrows when it introduced the original SlimStyle LED earlier this year. Months later, the company followed suit by announcing an LED floodlight that borrowed both the SlimStyle's name and its flattened-out approach to bulb design.

Something else the SlimStyle BR30 LED is borrowing from its predecessor is a slimmed-down price point. Due on Home Depot shelves this month at a retail price of $13 each, Philips' flat-minded floodlight will be one of the most affordable BR30 LEDs on the market. For that reason, I think it's a viable lighting-aisle option, in spite of a few notable shortcomings.

With its lanky build, the Philips SlimStyle BR30 certainly manages to stand out from its LED competitors. With a design that eliminates the need for bulky heat sinks, it weighs in at just three and a half ounces -- less than half the heft of some competitors, like the GE Reveal BR30 LED.

Turn the SlimStyle on, though, and you'd never guess it was such an oddly shaped floodlight. It casts the same wide, downward beam of light as an incandescent floodlight, and one that's practically indistinguishable from other BR30 LEDs. In terms of aesthetics, the radical design isn't coming at expense of the light quality.

Like the original SlimStyle, the new BR30 sports a body and bulb made entirely of plastic. This makes it a little less likely that a dropped bulb will break, but purists might find themselves missing the glass.

As for the SlimStyle's specs, it puts out 650 lumens of 2,700 K light from a power draw of 9.5 watts. That comes out to roughly 68 lumens per watt, which is perfectly decent for an LED floodlight, if not a touch lower than I'd like. Philips' own WarmGlow BR30 LED puts out 730 lumens from those same 9.5 watts, bumping the efficacy up to 77 lumens per watt.

Still, like all LEDs, the SlimStyle BR30 offers a clear efficiency upgrade over comparable 65W incandescents and halogens -- enough so that Philips expects it to earn Energy Star certification within the next few months. If that happens, users living in regions that offer energy rebates for high-efficiency lighting could see that $13 price tag decrease even further.

The SlimStyle is rated to last 25,000 hours, the same as essentially all of the major LED competitors. However, the SlimStyle's three-year warranty isn't as good as the five years you'll get with other Philips LEDs, or the ten years you'll get with the Cree BR30 LED and the GE Reveal BR30 LED.

With the SlimStyle in front of our spectrometer, we found that it had one of the most accurate color temperatures of any bulb we've ever tested -- just four degrees shy of its claimed 2,700 K. That makes it just as warm and yellowish as the incandescent you might be replacing.

We verified the SlimStyle's stated color rendering score of 80, which puts it on par with the average LED in terms of how vivid and accurate it'll make your colors look. For a BR30 LED with more of an emphasis on color rendering, consider the GE Reveal, which boasts a score of 89.

We were also able to verify the SlimStyle's low 9.5W power draw, though our equipment also picked up on a slight downtick in brightness from the stated output of 650 lumens. While only a difference of a few dozen lumens, it might still be a noteworthy factor for consumers who are especially concerned with the brightness of their bulbs.

Another brightness consideration we examined was with the SlimStyle's performance on an in-wall dimmer switch. We tested a variety of models, and found that at full blast on all of them, the SlimStyle would only put out about 89 percent of its total brightness (a little over 550 lumens). Ideally, you want your bulbs to meet 100 percent of their potential when the dimmer is dialed all the way up.

At the opposite end of the dial, the SlimStyle fared much better. Most LEDs will cut out at a certain point as you dial the light down, but the SlimStyle was able to dim smoothly down to zero. That bottom row of the above chart shows equally exposed, untouched photos of each of the dimmable BR30 LEDs we looked at, as dim as we could get them without the light turning off altogether. Clearly, with a light output of just six lumens or so, the SlimStyle was the winner.

Dimmable range is only part of the story, though. In-wall dimmer switches will lower the light by flashing the bulb on and off faster than the eye can see, which averages out to light that isn't as bright. This can cause electromagnetic interference in the bulb though, which in turn, can cause them to flicker and buzz.

When we tested A19 shaped 60W replacement LEDs, the original SlimStyle was  one of the worst offenders with regards to flicker and buzz, and unfortunately, its big brother isn't much better. On every dimmer we tested it on, the SlimStyle buzzed audibly, though not quite as loudly as the original. We also noticed plenty of flickering, especially on an older dimmer switch intended for incandescent use only.

In fairness, almost all of the BR30 LEDs we tested seemed to struggle not to flicker on dimmer switches, with one major exception. The GE Reveal BR30 LED put out steady, uninterrupted light, no matter which dimmer we used it with. It's hard to tell save for the slight wiggle we added, but the above image is a GIF of the GE Reveal animated using the exact same process (and on the exact same Leviton dimmer switch) as the GIF of the SlimStyle.

In the end, I think the SlimStyle's flicker issues are a pretty clear deal-breaker for anyone looking for a bulb to use with in-wall dimmer switches. If that's the situation you're in, spending the extra $4 per bulb on the GE Reveal seems worth it to me.

The final test that we run involves heat, and the bulb's ability to manage it over time. LEDs, like phones, laptops, and other electronics, will see diminished performance as their operating temperature rises.

With LEDs, this translates to a very slight, barely noticeable downtick in brightness during the first 30 minutes of use, as the bulb heats up. After that, the bulb will plateau at a ""steady state"" thanks to its heat sinks or whatever other thermal management process it uses. The higher the steady state, the better the thermal management.

In the SlimStyle's case, there are no heat sinks. Philips claims it doesn't need them, as the distribution of the diodes is designed to do a better job than other LEDs at dispersing the heat generated within the bulb.

This was the same claim made by the original SlimStyle LED. When we tested that bulb out, we found that it did indeed manage heat better than the competition, with performance that plateaued at a higher steady state than any other 60W replacement we reviewed.

The SlimStyle BR30 can't make that same claim, though. With our spectrometer's eye trained on each bulb, we're able to watch how heat affects performance over time, then graph the results. As you can see by the red line representing the SlimStyle, it did an adequate job, plateauing at around 92 percent of the bulb's initial power output.

That 92 percent figure is roughly the same point at which the original SlimStyle plateaued. However, the standard seems to be higher with BR30 LEDs, as 92 wasn't as good as the other Philips bulb we tested, nor was it better than the GE Reveal BR30 LED, which did the best job of all.

In each case, the downtick in brightness is barely noticeable, if at all. It's also important to remember that bulbs are rated for brightness and efficiency after reaching their steady state, which means the specs on the box should all be accurate even after they've gotten warm.

The real takeaway has to do with enclosed fixtures, where the heat can potentially build up in excess. In cases like this, a bulb with a higher steady state is probably your best bet, and, unlike its predecessor, the SlimStyle BR30 can't claim a higher steady state than its competitors.

The odd design aside, the Philips SlimStyle BR30 LED looks like an appealing value pick. At a price of $13, it's priced at least a few dollars below any of the major competitors. Like its little sibling, it isn't a good choice for anyone using dimmer switches, and I wish it were at least slightly more efficient -- but flaws like these are easier to forgive when you're saving money.

Still, given that you'll potentially be living with this purchase for the next few decades, I think it makes sense to consider spending the extra cash on a bulb that offers a little more. The $18 GE Reveal BR30 LED seems like an especially good deal to me with its impressive performance on dimmers, significantly longer warranty, and dramatically enhanced color rendering capabilities."
Philips Hue Tap review:|"

Color-changing smart bulbs are bundles of fun, but it isn't always practical to fish your phone out of your pocket in order to control them. Therein lies the appeal of the newest Philips Hue accessory, the Hue Tap. Stick it up on the wall next to the light switch, carry it around in your pocket, or leave it sitting out with its remote control brethren on the coffee table -- wherever it is, you'll be able to toggle your smart lights at the push of one its four buttons, no phone necessary. It also draws kinetic energy each time you use it, so there aren't any batteries or wires to worry about.

That sort of practicality makes abundant sense in complement to the clear novelty of a Philips Hue setup, and the Tap's kinetic-powered design adds in a unique cool factor of its own. At $60 in the US and £50 in the UK, the Tap is pricier than I'd like, but I still think it makes plenty of sense for anyone who's already using Hue LEDs in their home.

Designwise, the Hue Tap fits in well with the established white-and-gray Philips aesthetic. The round, minimalist build lends a little futurism to the Tap's look, which might help it blend especially well into homes featuring modern decor. It would probably stick out amid more classic furnishings, though.

The plastic-bodied Tap is also surprisingly light, weighing less than 2.5 ounces (70 grams). That might sound flimsy for such a relatively expensive controller, but it's largely a product of that kinetic powering mechanism. Lose the batteries, and you lose most of the bulk, too.

The Hue Tap comes with a backing that you can mount on the wall using screws or sticky tape. The Tap itself snaps into place, then twists back off whenever you want. That's a cool design touch, as it gives the Tap a permanent resting place, but still lets you grab it and go.

The tap has three small buttons on its face, which is a large, fourth button in its own right. Because of the kinetic-powered design, you need to press the small buttons hard enough to depress the large button, too. This requires more than a mere tap, and takes a little getting used to.

Within the Hue app, available for Android and iOS devices, you'll be able to add as many Taps as you like, then customize what each button on each one does. A button can turn a single bulb on, or it can control multiple bulbs at once. If you're using multiple Taps, you can set each one to control different sets of lights, which is a nice feature if you've got an elaborate, multiroom, smart-lighting setup.

One key feature is absent, though, and that's integration with IFTTT, the popular automation service that lets you connect things like Web services, social networks, and smart-home gadgetry using ""If This, Then That"" style recipes. Philips Hue LEDs were among the first connected devices to offer IFTTT integration, letting users connect their LEDs with other home automation systems, or automate their home lighting using things like weather alerts or how close they were to home.

The Hue Tap offers no such integration, which is both a surprise and a shame. The ability to use one of those four buttons as a dedicated ""IFTTT button"" capable of triggering whatever recipe you want would have been especially welcome, and would have potentially made the Tap exponentially more useful.

The  Belkin WeMo Light Switch  already figured this out, and offers its users the option to trigger IFTTT recipes with a single long press.  That's a nice feature for automation enthusiasts looking to shut off their lights, power off their electronics, and lock their doors all at once at the touch of a single button before bed.

All things considered, the Philips Hue Tap is a very simple device. You press a button, the lights change. In my tests, it was easy to add a Tap to an existing Philips Hue setup, the button presses always did what I expected them to do, and the range seemed perfectly decent, too.

This sort of simplicity works in the Tap's favor, as its ease of use ends up applying to your entire lighting setup. For instance, let's say you had a customized lighting scene for your weekly movie night. Before, you'd need to fiddle with your phone in order to trigger it, but with the Tap, it's just one button press away.

Still, the name ""Tap"" might be a bit misleading, as those small buttons require you to press them down a good ways before they'll activate. With a light tap, they'll offer a misleading click, but nothing will happen. You'll need to mash further and depress the large button that sits underneath before your lights will change.

This definitely takes some getting used to, but it isn't a horrible inconvenience by any stretch. What's more, since it's the trade-off for that cool, kinetic-powered design, I think Philips more or less gets a pass here. Between battery and button woes, the latter seems less annoying to me.

Another tiny qualm is that the buttons only go one way. If I use button three to turn my Hue lights on, pressing it again won't turn them back off. Similarly, if a button turns my lights blue, pressing it again won't turn them back to whatever they were before. That sort of customizability would have been interesting, and might make a good optional feature in a future Tap firmware update.

Still, it's easy enough just to assign one button as the off button, and by default, Philips does exactly that with the large, full-face button. Of course, you can customize all of the buttons to do whatever you like, but as a go-to off button, it does the job well.

The Philips Hue ecosystem has long been in need of physical controls, and the Hue Tap plays the part quite well. If you've already bought into Hue LEDs and you've been waiting for something like this that's capable of controlling them, then picking a Tap up for your home is pretty much a no-brainer.

For those of us that haven't yet pulled the trigger on a  Philips Hue Starter Kit , I think the Tap might make the system seem more accessible. Philips will likely need to lower the price before it sees much movement, however, or perhaps offer a kit that has the Tap bundled in. As tempting a novelty as color-changing smart lighting can be, many consumers are simply unwilling to spend $200 on a system like Hue. Adding a $60 accessory into the mix won't change that, even an accessory that works as well as the Tap does."
GE Energy Smart 60W Replacement LED review:|"

$10 LEDs were unheard of just a year or two ago, but since then, prices have fallen faster than many expected. Now, $10 seems to be the industry's go-to going rate for 60W replacements, with low-cost bulbs like the  	 Cree 60W Replacement LED  and the  Philips SlimStyle  lining store shelves.

A third big-brand option is GE'S Energy Smart 60W Replacement LED, currently available at Target, Walmart, and Sam's Club stores nationwide at that popular $10 price point. While slightly less efficient than what you'll get from Cree and not as design-oriented as the SlimStyle, the GE LED still offers reasonable value in its own right, along with a subtle bump in color quality. As a baseline bulb, it's worth a look.

GE's LED isn't the most exciting bulb on the market. It lacks the eye-catching design of the Philips SlimStyle and hasn't seen the same sort of buzz that the market-moving Cree LED managed to generate last year.

Still, at $10, this is a bulb that merits consideration. With a light output of 800 lumens, it matches the SlimStyle and the Cree LED in terms of brightness -- though at a power draw of 11 watts, it's the least efficient of the three, if only just slightly so.

Of those three options, the GE LED also has the lowest color temperature. All three aim for 2,700 K -- the yellowy, familiar glow of an incandescent -- but the GE LED lands farthest from the target, with a measured color temperature of 2,562 K. If anything, this only serves to give it a slight extra hit of yellow, so if that's the color you like from your lights, you might actually prefer the GE LED's tone.

Another spec of note is the bulb's stated lifespan. Most LEDs claim to last for 25,000 hours -- a figure that actually describes the amount of time before the diodes will fade to 70 percent of their original light output. The GE LED, however, claims a 15,000-hour lifespan. At an average of three hours of usage per day, this still means it should last well over a decade -- long enough to pay for itself several times over if you're replacing an incandescent -- but that might not be enough for sticklers determined to get maximum value out of their LEDs.

The GE LED comes with a 5-year warranty, and at roughly 36 percent of the bulb's stated lifespan, that's a pretty good deal. If you're replacing an incandescent, the GE LED should pay for itself long before your coverage runs out. Still, if a reassuring warranty is what you're after, you'll be much happier with the Cree LED, which comes with a 10-year warranty.

Something else that may be worth considering is how the bulb will perform if used with a dimmer switch. Like most other LED offerings these days, the GE LED promises dimmability, and we confirmed this with a number of different switches, including an older model not rated for LED use. There was a slight buzz in the bulb, the result of electromagnetic interference from the dimming mechanism, but it wasn't nearly as noticeable as what we heard from the Philips SlimStyle in  our recent round of dimming tests.

The other dimming concerns to keep in mind are flicker and dimmable range. With the first, the GE LED did quite well, showing next to no flicker as I dialed the light level up and down with each of our setups. The dimmable range was much less satisfying, though. I wasn't able to dial the light down below 30 percent or so with any of the dimmers. Many consumers, myself included, will prefer a light that can dim down a lot closer to zero before cutting out.

What this all boils down to is that the GE LED's specs don't show any glaring weak spots, but they also don't give it any clear advantages over the competition. It's a great option compared to the bargain brands that you might find on the bottom shelf -- but so are the LEDs from other major manufacturers like Philips and Cree. Compared to those bulbs, it's hard to find a reason to recommend GE.

The one area where GE might be able to claim a slight advantage would be color quality, as measured by the CRI number. The CRI, or color rendering index, measures how accurately a given light source is able to render specific colors. Put simply, a higher CRI score means better-looking colors.

Like the Cree LED and the Philips SlimStyle, the GE LED claims a CRI score of 80 out of 100. However, that score represents an average of several scores, each one pertaining to a different shade. That means that different bulbs can take different routes to get the same score -- which in turn means that one 80 might look slightly better than another 80.

That's exactly what you get with the GE LED: a slightly better take on 80. Compare the GE LED with the Cree LED, for instance, and you'll notice less overpowering yellows, more natural whites, and slightly more vivid colors. In the end, it's a pretty tiny difference, but it's still a difference. For someone with artwork on display or a particularly colorful interior design aesthetic, I think it might be just enough to tip the scales in GE's favor.

Still, I have to believe that a consumer like that would want to spend a few extra dollars on a high-CRI bulb like the  Cree TW Series LED or GE's own  Reveal LED. Both of those boast CRI scores in the 90s. There's also the $5  Ikea Ledare LEDs  which boast an impressive CRI score of 87 -- though they aren't as bright or efficient as what GE is offering, and they don't come with a warranty.

The GE Energy Smart 60W Replacement LED is a tough bulb to criticize. As a base-line LED at that attractive $10 price point, it offers very decent value -- especially if you're upgrading from an incandescent.

Still, the competition in the lighting aisle is getting increasingly fierce, and GE hasn't done enough to set its bulb apart. The  Cree LED  offers exceptional efficiency and comes with an industry-leading 10-year warranty. The  Philips SlimStyle has an innovative design, solid specs, and an especially tempting price point. Even the less dim, less efficient  Ikea LEDs  can claim surprisingly high color-rendering scores and a dirt cheap price point of $5. GE's LED looks unambitious by comparison, which makes it difficult to recommend."
Philips SlimStyle LED review:|"

The lighting aisle's LED section is getting more and more crowded with legitimate values, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that manufacturers are looking for new ways to stand out. Enter the Philips SlimStyle, a low-cost LED that sets itself apart with an unusual, flattened design.

This two-dimensional spin on modern, high efficiency lighting promises to replace the best aspects of a traditional incandescent while saving money on your monthly power bill. It also costs just $9, which converts roughly to AU$10, or £5 in the UK (Philips says it has no plans to expand the SlimStyle beyond North America at this time, but won't rule it out, either).

That price point is a dollar less than you'll spend for the well-reviewed  	 Cree 60W Replacement LED , and significantly less than  Philips' own standard 60W equivalent . Though it isn't a flawless light, or quite as cheap as the  bargain LEDs that you'll find at Ikea , the accessible SlimStyle nonetheless offers excellent value, making it a good go-to bulb for common household lighting needs.

The decision to make a flat LED wasn't an arbitrary one. With a flat design, Philips was able to distribute the diodes around the bulb's perimeter, away from the heat at its base. This eliminates the need for aluminum heat sinks, which makes the bulb a lot lighter, and more importantly, a lot cheaper to produce.

The question is whether or not the flat design compromises the SlimStyle's ability to light like a typical light bulb. For the most part, the answer is no. With a light output of 800 lumens and a very accurate color temperature just under 2,700 K, it's a perfectly worthy replacement for a 60W incandescent. As for efficiency, the 25,000-hour lifespan and the 10.5W power draw put it right on par with other solid LED options. The color rendering score of 80 is in line with  what you'd expect from most other LEDs, too.

The flat design does introduce a small problem with directionality, though. Like many of the LEDs available today, the SlimStyle promises omnidirectional light output, which means it claims to produce light evenly in all directions. This is mostly true -- except for the left and right sides of the bulb's profile, where you'll find dim spots.  These get especially noticeable if you're using the SlimStyle under a lampshade.

Whether or not this is a deal breaker is up to you. Personally, I can't say that the dim spots would bother me all that much, as they don't ultimately affect how much light the SlimStyle puts out. I'd certainly notice them, though -- and that alone might be enough to get me to spend the extra buck on a Cree LED.

More likely to motivate my buying decision would be the difference in warranty between the two bulbs. The SlimStyle is covered for three years, compared to 10 years from Cree. That's a pretty substantial difference for such a small price increase, and probably well worth it for anyone who might doubt LED longevity claims.

Something else worth considering before settling on a bulb is whether or not you'll be using it with a dimmer switch. Most of the current LED offerings from major manufacturers claim dimmer compatibility and the SlimStyle is no exception, but as we learned in  our recent round of tests, not all dimmable bulbs are created equal.

In those tests, the SlimStyle showed the poorest performance. While it was compatible with every switch that we tested (even an older one designed for incandescents only), it also buzzed noticeably when used with each one, a result of electromagnetic interference in the bulb from the switch's dimming mechanism. The SlimStyle also showed a moderate amount of flicker, another common problem with dimmable lights.

After we published the results of those tests, Philips sent us some additional bulbs, telling us that the newest versions of the SlimStyle might perform better with dimmers than the release-day bulb we had tested. If there is a performance difference, it's a fractional one, and not one that we were able to detect. On our dimmer switches, the newer SlimStyles still buzzed, and they still showed a light amount of flicker, same as before.

All of this is to say that if you're buying a bulb for use with a dimmer switch, you'll want to go with something other than the SlimStyle. The best choice would actually be  Philips' own standard 60W Equivalent LED , which aced the same dimmability tests that the SlimStyle flunked. At $15, that bulb costs a fair deal more than the SlimStyle, but I think it's worth it if you want smooth, dimmable light with no flicker or buzz.

Another bulb-buying consideration has to do with the heat generated by the circuitry inside. Just like with your phone or laptop, this heat will affect the bulb's performance, which is why LEDs put such a strong emphasis on thermal management.

When you first turn an LED on, there isn't any heat, so the power and light output that you see should be at something close to an optimal level. As the bulb heats up, generally over the course of about 30 minutes, the power output will diminish very slightly, until the bulb plateaus at what manufacturers call the ""steady state.""

Before you cry foul, keep in mind that the decline in light output is only barely noticeable, if at all. Also, LEDs don't get rated for brightness or efficiency until after they've hit their steady state, so you aren't getting shortchanged on specs.

With our spectrometer, we can track an LED's visible power output over time, then graph that steady state for ourselves, and we decided to do just that. The purple line in the graph above represents the Philips SlimStyle's power output over time, and as you can see, it does a great job, flatlining at around 92 percent of its initial brightness.

That's a higher steady state than any other bulb we've tested, and the only one we've found above 90 percent. Results like that suggest that heat doesn't affect the SlimStyle's performance as much as it does with other LEDs, which lends some credence to the bulb's unique design.

The practical takeaway from this is that the Philips SlimStyle might be an especially good choice for use in enclosed fixtures. Trap a bulb inside a fixture, and you're trapping it with the heat it produces, which can lower the steady state and potentially reduce the bulb's lifespan, too. A bulb like the SlimStyle, which manages heat particularly well, stands to suffer a lot less in settings like this than other LEDs.

At $9 each (or lower, if you live in a region that offers instant rebates for Energy Star-certified light bulbs), the Philips SlimStyle offers plenty of light bulb bang for your buck. You won't have any problems with its brightness or color temperature, and if you're switching over from incandescents, you certainly won't be complaining when your next power bill arrives.

That said, for a dollar more, the  Cree 60W Replacement LED  offers an uptick in efficiency, along with a 10-year warranty that's more than three times what you'll get for the SlimStyle. And for ultimate value, the  $5 Ledare LEDs at Ikea  are awfully tough to beat -- although their diminished brightness and lack of a warranty stop me from recommending them outright.

If you're looking for a bulb to use with a dimmer switch, you'll want to look elsewhere, as the SlimStyle tends to buzz quite a bit more than other LEDs whenever you dim down to 50 percent or lower. On the other hand, for enclosed fixtures -- globes, sconces, and so on -- the SlimStyle seems to be an ideal option."
BOT Home Automation Doorbot review:|"



BOT Home Automation's $200 (available internationally for about £120, AU$215) Doorbot is an all-in-one security and convenience device -- with companion app -- that gives you front door visibility and communication capabilities whether you're home or away. Replace your current doorbell with Doorbot, connect it to your home Wi-Fi, download the Android or iOS app, and receive alerts whenever someone buzzes your front door. Thanks to Doorbot's built-in video camera and speaker-and-mic combo, you can also see live footage of visitors and chat with them without opening your door.

In contrast to these promising features, I experienced poor video quality and found the two-way talk feature completely unusable. While a Doorbot-style product definitely has a place in the smart home market, I'd skip this model and look for future iterations with improved performance.





Doorbot is an 8.1-ounce (230g) outdoor-rated device that measures 1.30 inches deep by 2.4 inches wide by 5.7 inches tall (3.3cm by 6cm by 14.5cm). It has a silver finish and a solid build. You have two installation options -- hardwire it directly to your existing doorbell cables to avoid any low-battery concerns, or rely on the built-in battery for power and recharge it roughly once a year with the included USB charger.

I downloaded the Doorbot app on my iPhone 5 to start the setup process. Doorbot is compatible with iOS 6.1 or later and version 2.3 or later on Android devices, and can operate on 3G, 4G, LTE, and Wi-Fi (both home and away). That means that you should be able to see who's at your front door whether you're sitting on the couch at home or on vacation thousands of miles away.

Next, I created an account, named my Doorbot, provided my time zone information, removed my old doorbell, and mounted the new one. I installed my review unit at home and simply used some strong two-sided tape to mount it to the door frame. You'll definitely want to mount it properly for a more permanent install, but this worked well for testing. Since my old doorbell wasn't wired in, I didn't have to deal with hardwiring at all.

The app then instructs you to press the doorbell button, causing the LED ring around it to flash blue. Select the Doorbot Wi-Fi network in your settings, wait for the app to prompt you to enter your home Wi-Fi information, and let it connect. Now you're ready to use Doorbot.

Doorbot has a video camera, a doorbell, a speaker, a microphone, and a related app. It connects to your local Wi-Fi and any time a visitor rings the doorbell, you will receive a push notification. The camera will also automatically start recording live footage of your guest and give you the option to talk to them using the app's ""hold to talk"" feature (Doorbot doesn't save video clips like an Wi-Fi camera). Any time you use ""hold to talk,"" you won't be able to hear your visitor speaking. Just release the button to hear their response -- think of it as an intercom system that enables communication between your connected device and your Doorbot.

I tested Doorbot using both a cellular connection and Wi-Fi and found the results to be pretty much the same. The overall video quality was very poor and the two-way talk feature worked roughly 10 percent of the time -- whether I was 5 feet or 5 miles away.

Specifically, the video was extremely pixelated, making it very difficult to determine who was actually at my front door. And, if they happened to move at all, the video would blur beyond any possible point of recognition; this was true using both day and night vision modes.

The ""hold to talk"" feature was even more disappointing. I tried it multiple times under different scenarios -- both as the person with the app and as the person actually ringing the doorbell. Only infrequently did I hear audio coming out of the Doorbot speakers, but I was never able to pick up on any return audio coming back through the the Doorbot microphone to my phone.

If I were depending entirely on Doorbot for clear video and two-way talk I doubt that I would be able to distinguish my next-door-neighbor from the UPS delivery person and so on. As a result, I'd likely need to default back to the traditional get-up-off-the-couch-to-see-who-is-at-the-door.

Aside from needing better video quality and two-way talk, this unit could benefit from a motion sensor, too. Not everyone will ring your doorbell and you won't be notified when someone knocks. And since Doorbot doesn't really look like a traditional doorbell, it's likely that some of your guests might opt to knock instead anyway.

As far as the DIY smart home market is concerned, Doorbot offers a unique combination of features and has relatively few competitors. Recently, a 23-year-old student won a competition by tech company Sharp for his  SmartBell concept, which isn't available for retail yet, but offers many of the same features as Doorbot. Currently, the $200 SkyBell Video Doorbell (also available internationally; converted, about £120, AU$215) is Doorbot's closest competition, and was listed as an iOS 8 HomeKit partner at Apple's recent WWDC 2014. I've requested a review unit, so comparison testing of its features and performance against Doorbot is forthcoming.

Right now, Doorbot needs too much work to justify spending $200. Still, I'm hopeful that this doorbell-video camera-intercom hybrid will undergo some much-needed tweaks and return with a vengeance. Until then, hold on to your cash and continue squinting through that tiny peephole."
Nanoleaf Bloom review:|"

The Nanoleaf Bloom calls itself a dimmable light bulb that doesn't need a dimmer. Thanks to clever programming, the bulb will fade up to full brightness over the course of a few seconds after being turned on -- flip the switch off and on at any time during that period, and you'll lock in the light level at that specific point.

That's a pretty neat trick from a pretty neat-looking bulb, but you'll have to pony up if you want to try one out. Reserving a Nanoleaf Bloom from the Toronto-based startup's already-successful Kickstarter campaign will cost you $40 -- roughly AU$45, or £25 in the UK. That price is more than twice as much as you'll spend on LEDs from brands like Philips and Cree that boast comparable brightness and efficiency specs.

That $40 price tag is also higher than some of the increasingly affordable smart bulbs we've seen lately, and those offer built-in dimming smarts of their own, along with automation capabilities. It's easy to like the Nanoleaf Bloom, but with competition like that, it's hard to see the value.

Available in grey or black (or a variety of colors for bulk orders), the Nanoleaf Bloom sports the same, unique, 3D-printed exoskeleton as its predecessor, last year's NanoLight (now known as the Nanoleaf One). That product ultimately raised well over 10 times its funding goal, and Nanoleaf looks to have the same crowdfunding momentum this year, so it's a design that clearly seems to strike a chord with consumers.

That isn't terribly surprising given the fact that Nanoleaf's light bulbs look utterly unlike anything else in the lighting aisle. There's an audacious quality to the diode-dotted jigsaw assembly, as if you're looking at an early prototype of a futuristic game-changer.

But from a pricing perspective, the Nanoleaf Bloom is less the bulb of tomorrow than it is the bulb of yesterday. Last year, 75W replacement LEDs were hard to come by, and -- like the original NanoLight -- often fetched prices of $30 or more. Since then, new options have entered the mainstream, and prices have come down considerably. At $40, the Nanoleaf Bloom is priced to compete with last year's LED market, not this year's.

All that said, an elevated price point is justifiable if the product in question offers elevated features, too, and to an extent the Nanoleaf Bloom succeeds in this regard. Beyond the bulb's unique dimming capabilities, the Bloom offers exceptional efficiency, putting out 1,200 lumens from a power draw of just 10 watts. That's dramatically more efficient than the nearest competitors from Philips, GE, and Cree.

I was a bit disappointed by the Bloom's color rendering capabilities, though. Our spectrometer measured its CRI score at 77, which makes it incrementally inferior to the other 75W replacements we've tested. While largely an unnoticeable difference, I still expect a bit better from a $40 bulb.

In terms of lifespan, the Nanoleaf Bloom promises a slightly longer-than-average 30,000 hours, though the 2-year warranty isn't quite as long as what you'll get from a major manufacturer like Philips or Cree, which offers a 10-year warranty on its 75W replacement LED.

The team at Nanoleaf also claims that you'll be able to use the Bloom in enclosed fixtures without needing to worry about the light overheating. In the event that it does get too hot, the bulb will automatically dim down until things cool off. In our tests, this feature never needed to kick in.

There's definitely a slight learning curve with the Nanoleaf Bloom. If you want to take advantage of its dimming capabilities, you'll need to train yourself to execute a well-timed double-flick of the switch during the few seconds as it fades to full brightness.

As you can probably imagine, this isn't always terribly precise. While testing the bulb's dimming feature out, I never felt quite sure of where exactly I was locking the light level in at. A few fractions of a second is all that separates 40 percent brightness from 80 percent, so if you want something specific, you'll almost certainly end up eyeballing it until you're at ""bright enough"" percent.

Once the bulb is locked into a steady state, you can do another double-flick to tell the Nanoleaf to start dimming back down. You can lock the light level at any point during this fade-out with the same double-flick technique as before, or you can just let the bulb dim all the way down to its lowest setting, which Nanoleaf calls ""Night Mode."" Night Mode looks good for exposed lighting, and might work well as a sort of nerdy nightlight, but it isn't quite as dim as I'd like.

You can also enter Night Mode while the bulb is off by flicking the switch three times, on, then off, then on. I appreciate that Nanoleaf gives you two simple ways to get to the bottom of the bulb's dimmable range, as this will probably be one of the most common dimming targets people will be aiming for.

It's worth noting that the Nanoleaf Bloom won't work correctly with in-wall dimmer switches. When I tested it out on a Lutron model designed specifically for LEDs, the bulb would turn on, but wouldn't recognize the wall switch as I dialed it up and down. It did, however, begin pulsing up and down when I set the wall switch at maximum brightness, which looked a little cool, but probably isn't what you're going for. Additionally, the bulb failed to recognize any of its own double-flick dimming controls.

Nanoleaf's team says that they're working on a version of the Bloom that's capable of detecting when it's being used with an existing dimmer switch, then deferring to those controls, but for now, their product is designed for standard, two-setting switches only. Last year's NanoLight, on the other hand, promises to play nice with existing dimmer setups, though I wasn't able to test one of those out.

The Nanoleaf Bloom also won't work with three-way lamps that are designed to work with bulbs capable of putting out three distinct levels of brightness. It will, however, work with fixtures that are controlled by multiple light switches. The bulb also claims global voltage compatibility (100V to 240V), and comes with either an Edison-style screw-in base (pictured), or a B22 bayonet-style base.

In the end, the Bloom's unique spin on dimming is intriguing, and I like the fact that there wasn't any buzzing or flickering as I dialed the light up and down. However, it's an imprecise and imperfect solution. If you care enough about dimmable lighting to have an interest in this bulb, then I imagine you also care enough to want greater, more exacting controls than Nanoleaf is offering.

In my home, I have a  Connected by TCP Wireless LED Kit  (currently a US-only kit), with dimmable, buzz-free bulbs that I can control through a smartphone app or a physical remote. I prefer controls like that to the Nanoleaf approach. The scalability is better with TCP, too -- a two-bulb TCP kit currently costs about $80 at Home Depot, with additional bulbs available for $20. Other smart bulb options like the low-cost  GE Link LEDs  look promising, too.

If you're willing to spend a little extra on a quirky-looking conversation starter of a bulb, the Nanoleaf Bloom certainly has its charms. Ultimately though, I think there's better value to be found elsewhere."
Vocca billed to make any light bulb smart and voice-controlled|"

Even the slickest smartphone-linked light bulbs are impractical compared with simple, old school switches. According to gadget maker ActiVocal, the most intelligent interface between humans and their lighting is the spoken word. The company's new solution, the Vocca, promises to turn any ordinary light bulb into a device with electronic ears peeled just for you. Yes, instead of navigating through layers of phone menus just to turn the lights on and off, with the Vocca installed users merely utter a key word or phrase to control illumination.

In terms of abilities and physical form the Vocca sits somewhere between the infamous Clapper sound-activated gizmo of decades past, and today's fancy smart bulbs made by  Philips  and  Lifx . Essentially it's an adapter, though admittedly a sophisticated one.  At one end of the Vocca is a standard threaded cap built to screw into existing household E27 (standard in the US, and fairly common in the UK) sockets and fixtures.

On the other side you'll find a cavity which accepts a wide range of E27 bulbs spanning a number of common voltage requirements (110/220V, 50/60Hz). Also packed into the Vocca, claims ActiVocal, is all the hardware necessary for giving basic dumb bulbs the smarts to listen out for an all-powerful voice command. Specifically the Vocca will respond to the words, ""Vocca switch light"" to either power on or off its attached bulb.

In case you were wondering, ActiVocal sees a great many useful scenarios for a voice-activated light. These include beds (as in not having to get out of them), leaving or arriving home with your hands full, medical ailments, or simply being flat-out lazy. To extoll the virtues and potential uses of the Vocca, the company even created its own wacky video which tries to break down just what the Vocca is all about.

Additionally ActiVocal explains that Vocca owners will still be able to use their existing light switches if they want. ActiVocal has plans in the works too for a Vocca Pro model adapter, one which will be customizable and offer greater smarts than the basic gadget. In a nutshell, the Pro will support custom voice phrase commands and talk to Android and iOS mobile apps as well.

At the moment many important details for the Vocca remain murky. ActiVocal has not pinned a price for either the standard Vocca or Vocca Pro. The same goes for a target ship date to spotlight when or even where customers will conceivably see the Vocca on sale. That said, the firm, which is based in Tel Aviv, already currently hawks another device featuring verbal control, a line of voice phone dialers, so perhaps the reality of Vocca hitting the global market isn't unlikely.

Of course the Vocca will face some stiff competition from various quarters. There's the  Emberlight , an alternative lighting solution which also separates the smarts from the bulb and accepts standard light bulbs. The  Insteon smart home platform also plans to flaunt a strong connection to Windows 8.1 smartphones, plus interface with Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant. And don't forget about Google and Apple's plans to fold smart home abilities into Android and iOS, courtesy of  Nest and HomeKit, respectively."
Emberlight offers BYOB smart lighting (bring your own bulb, that is)|"

Smart lighting certainly has a lot of appeal, but what if you've already invested in non-smart bulbs that promise to last decades? San Francisco-based startup Emberlight thinks it has the solution, with a brainy adapter that promises to smarten up your existing stock of light bulbs.

Essentially, Emberlight is a smart bulb without the bulb. You screw it in, then screw in whatever bulb you want -- LED, CFL, halogen, you name it. Emberlight takes it from there, offering smart scheduling, proximity detection, and full automation controls through direct Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE connections with your Android or iOS device -- no hub necessary.

Emberlight is seeking its capital through Kickstarter, where the campaign has already surpassed its $50,000 goal despite still having well over a month left on the clock. Emberlight's suggested retail price is $60, which converts to roughly £35, or AU$65 (orders outside of the US will need to tack on an additional $15 for shipping). At launch, Emberlight will only be available in Edison 26/27 screw base configurations, but down-light and bayonet-style models are said to be on the way, as well. And it's designed to work with the various main voltages and frequencies in use around the world.

That isn't an insignificant price tag -- especially if you're planning on outfitting multiple lights in your home. Still, there's an awful lot to like about the notion of adding a la carte smarts to existing light bulbs.

One obvious benefit is that by keeping the bulb separate from the smarts, you won't need to throw out (and replace) that smart hardware just because the bulb breaks or burns out. The fact that you'll be able to add smarts to the specific bulb of your choosing is another nice perk, and likely music to the ears of anyone who's picky about the look of their lights.

That said, Emberlight looks like it'll add a good inch or so to the length of your bulb, which might keep it from fitting into tight fixtures. Even if the bulb does fit, there's a good chance that it'll stick out more noticeably than before, which seems like the sort of thing some consumers might find irritating.

Emberlight is scheduled to ship out to Kickstarter backers in February 2015. If you don't feel like waiting that long, consider checking out the  Connected by TCP Wireless LED Kit  or the newly announced  GE Link LEDs , two relatively inexpensive smart-lighting options."
Say hi to BloomSky, your personal eye for local weather (hands-on)|"

For some weather addicts, info gleaned from mobile phone apps, TV stations, and other broadcast media just isn't detailed or immediate enough. These meteorology buffs crave a device that will track hyperlocal data in real time, right from their backyard. Not to worry though, because San Francisco-based startup BloomSky plans to satisfy the specific needs of this special customer by adding a new twist to the fledgling world of personal weather stations.

The company envisions its gadget not just sensing environmental staples such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The $169 (which converts to £100/AU$180) BloomSky gizmo is built to measure UV light and notice the start of any significant precipitation. And equipped with an HD camera plus a Wi-Fi radio, the Internet-connected BloomSky should also be smart enough to snap and send its owners pictures during dramatic meteorological events.

Meeting the BloomSky device up close, it's hard not to escape its ocular appearance. With a body that's circular and orb-shaped, the BloomSky certainly reminds me of giant eyeball, but in a good way.  About the size of your average grapefruit, the prototype we manhandled was chock full of pleasant curves and comforting rounded edges. Still, with a big camera lens placed front-and-center on its face, it's not crazy to imagine the product is gazing at you.

The BloomSky, however, doesn't have an eye out for people or even stray animals, but rather the weather. Indeed, the primary ball-shaped unit is meant to sit atop its custom pole, which is meant to be driven into the ground like a stake. From its perch, say its creators, the machine will occupy household yards, lawns, and other residential garden spots, sniffing out all sorts of environmental stats.

While the gadget that BloomSky showed off was a non-functional dummy for display purposes only, the company pledged that the final device will bristle with a sizeable array of sensors. These include ways to assess temperature, ambient light (both in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum), air pressure, and humidity levels.

Nice, too, is the BloomSky's moisture detector, which records the occurrence and intensity of precipitation. In theory you'll be able to know just how hard the rain is falling on your roof, from the lightest sprinkle to the most torrential deluge. Competing products such as the $180  Netatmo Weather Station  (£139, AY$199) support this feature, but it's not bundled in the base kit.

The BloomSky gadget connects to your home's Wi-Fi, which allows its users access to sensor info via a companion mobile app anywhere they enjoy a live wireless network link. Android users be advised, the company expects to offer only an iOS version of the application initially. BloomSky told me,  however, that Android software is in the works as well.

Of course the slickest functionality in the BloomSky's current tool kit is its HD camera (1,600x1,200 pixels). Paired with the gizmo's various sensors, BloomSky engineers explain that the product will be keenly aware of its surroundings and will snap photos when compelling weather conditions present themselves. In addition, while not a true video-capture device, the imaging system can stitch multiple pictures together into time-lapse videos.

BloomSky expects its weather station to be powered by two rechargeable battery options, either a standard lithium ion or a premium lithium polymer model. Both choices provide juice for about 20 days of run time, with the major difference being lifespan (7 or 15 years). You can avoid the energy question altogether, though, and spring an extra $39 for a solar panel add-on module. Other planned upgrades in the BloomSky system include an indoor module ($39) to monitor conditions within your home along with a wall-mounting kit ($9).

Will these personal weather-station gadgets, and specifically the BloomSky, prove successful from a sales standpoint? I think the jury is still out on that one. Priced at $169, even the base kit is not an impulse purchase. Throw in other extras like the solar panel charging solution and indoor module ($39 apiece) and you're looking at almost a $250 tab (shipping not included).

Availability outside the US hasn't been announced yet. However, for comparison's sake, the above costs convert to roughly £100 or AU$180 for the base kit, and another £23/AU$41 for each of the add-ons at the current exchange rate.  The company's Kickstarter page does mention shipping the base kit to offshore destinations for an additional $25 charge, which works out to approximately £15/AU$27 and goes up from there depending on which package you opt for.

Forgive me, but you'd have to be one heck of a weather fanboy to justify spending that kind of loot. This is especially true considering that mobile apps, TV, and radio serve up very local weather conditions including forecasts -- something the BloomSky won't provide at launch. That said, according to BloomSky founder and CEO J.T. Xiao there are definite plans to leverage the BloomSky's camera toward that end. Mr Xiao told me in a recent interview, ""One thing we imagine BloomSky to do in the future is to utilize its camera and pictures it takes combined with its other sensors for weather forecasts.""

Also slick is the potential for grouped BloomSky devices to one day talk to each other and provide a current snapshot of hyper-local weather. This scenario, however, is a long way away, with Xiao explaining that technology to drive forecasting via linked BloomSky units is at least a year down the road.

Still eager to get your hands on a BloomSky right away? Sadly, unless you're one of the lucky people who backed the project via Kickstarter or part of the company's small San Francisco beta test group, you'll have to wait until the fourth quarter of 2014 (essentially the end of the year) before the startup expects to ship hardware to ordinary buyers."
Belkin NetCam HD+ Wi-Fi Camera review:|"

Belkin's $130 NetCam HD+ (£130 in the UK, and AU$170 in Australia) is an updated version of the brand's existing NetCam HD. The basic NetCam HD had decent specs already, but Belkin added two-way talk and WeMo product integration to its latest iteration -- these extra features give the new NetCam HD+ Wi-Fi camera a unique edge over other DIY security IPs.

While its 720p resolution didn't match the $199  Dropcam Pro's  1080p, it still returned a pretty clear image on both the web and mobile apps (although that could vary depending on your Wi-Fi connection). And, if you spend $10 a month or $100 a year on the optional Cloud+ services, you can save 14 days of clips and receive instant push notifications whenever the built-in motion detector senses activity. Overall, Belkin's $130 NetCam HD+ delivers high-end features at a comparatively affordable price and I think it's a great fit for anyone interested in a solid lower-cost IP camera -- just be prepared to trade some video quality for the HD+'s value.

The NetCam HD+ has a white finish and is made up of plastic components, with the exception of a small metal joint that connects the camera to its stand. That metal component makes it very easy to adjust the camera angle as needed. While the HD+ doesn't feel as durable as the Dropcam Pro, it is well proportioned and nicely designed -- especially compared with Samsung's top-heavy $189  SmartCam HD Pro .

The box includes the camera, an integrated stand, a power cord, and hardware for optional wall mounting. It has a 95-degree diagonal field of view and a glass lens. Since the $199  Piper security system  has a 180-degree glass fish-eye lens, this 95-degree lens isn't particularly impressive. But, that shouldn't be a problem if you want to monitor a smaller room or a particular section of your home or business.

While Belkin's HD+ doesn't have Dropcam Pro-level optics, the local SD card storage of the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro, or the Z-Wave compatibility and additional environmental sensors of Piper, a side-by-side comparison may make you think twice before spending $199 on a Dropcam when you can get something pretty similar for $130.

The HD+  has a speaker and a microphone, free real-time monitoring, night vision, and the option of 14-day cloud storage and motion-related push notifications for an additional $10/month or $100/year. You can also set up rules with Belkin WeMo products on the WeMo app.

Here's a rundown of the NetCam HD+'s options versus the competition:

This IP camera was very easy to set up. Basic instructions are included in the box, but the Belkin NetCam Android or iOS app can also guide you from start to finish. The whole process took less than 10 minutes.

It was as simple as plugging in the camera, connecting to the Belkin NetCam Wi-Fi network, and downloading and launching the app. The app immediately recognized the new camera and walked me through registration and final steps.

You can see the name of every camera you have registered on the home screen -- I named mine ""Living Room."" From there, you can click on the camera and start monitoring live.  You can access a handful of different features directly from the video screen. Take a screenshot or a recording of what you see and it will automatically show up in your phone's photo directory. You can also click on the speaker to listen to audio and hold down the microphone button to talk.

There's also a settings section where you can customize your camera a bit more -- change its name, share footage with friends, adjust the sensitivity of the microphone, speaker, and motion detector, opt in to email notifications, and access the optional NetCam Cloud+ Premium services. Email notifications will only send you screenshots of motion activity, so many of you will want to spend the $10/month or $100/year on Cloud+. Fortunately, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial to decide if 14 days of rolling video clip storage, motion-related push notifications, and the ability to permanently save motion-triggered clips as MP4 files are worth it.

Belkin's NetCam HD+ delivered very good performance throughout testing. I received instant push notifications and emails when the camera detected motion. The saved video clips were clearly timestamped for easy access and the live monitoring and related two-way talk features were similarly straightforward.

I did experience periodic lag times and blurry video footage, particularly when someone walked by quickly, but it didn't cause any significant performance issues. I do wish the HD+ could send notifications based on sound like the Dropcam Pro, the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro, and Piper, but I'm willing to accept that this reasonably-priced Wi-Fi camera can't double as a baby monitor.

Currently, the Belkin NetCam app controls the majority of the HD+'s functionality, while the separate WeMo app handles any rules you may want to set up between the HD+ and WeMo devices. I would prefer HD+ access  exclusively from the WeMo app, but it wasn't terribly inconvenient. I used the WeMo app to create the rule, ""When the camera detects motion, turn on the lamp connected to the WeMo Switch."" I didn't experience any issues with it, and  as the WeMo line grows , the options for rule customization are sure to expand.

Belkin's $130 NetCam HD+ isn't perfect, but it does a lot when you compare its price with those of some of its competition. For roughly $70 less than the $199 Dropcam Pro and the $199 Piper, and roughly $60 less than the $189 Samsung SmartCam HD Pro, you get decent video footage, WeMo product integration, night vision, and responsive motion alert emails.

If you're concerned about your feed being filtered through Belkin's server, you should probably avoid Cloud-based IP cameras altogether.  And if you want audio alerts and a wider-angle lens, consider the $199 Dropcam Pro or the $199 Piper. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this camera to someone searching for an easy and affordable entry point into home security and home automation."
Ikea Ledare LED review:|"

If you haven't heard, LED prices are trending downward, with many popular bulbs starting to sell for less than $10 each in the US. Ikea recently decided to take things even further, cutting the price of their 40W and 60W replacement ""Ledare"" LEDs down below $5 -- a move that seems likely to help sway the minds and wallets of the last of the LED holdouts.

Purists, however, might be justifiably skeptical. With diminished brightness, lower efficiency, and no warranty whatsoever, these bulbs aren't exactly no-compromise  -- and they don't boast nearly as attractive a price point in Australia or the UK, where Ikea sells them for AU$10 and £7 each, respectively.

Still, Ikea wisely seems to be emphasizing aesthetics with the Ledare LEDs, and that, coupled with unmatched value in the US, makes them a potential best buy for millions of consumers. If you're in need of new bulbs and you live near one of Ikea's megastores, you might just want to pencil a few Ledare LEDs onto your next visit's shopping list.

The Ledare 60W replacement LEDs come in two equally priced varieties: one with a frosted bulb, and one with a bulb that's clear. The clear-bulbed version offers a view of the diodes inside -- they sit beneath a bowl-like fixture which reflects the light up and out in 360 degrees.

The two globe varieties are the only real difference between the two models. Both put out the same amount of light using the same amount of power. We did, however, notice a slight improvement in directionality with the frosted globe, which suggests that it helps to diffuse the light more evenly.

The clear bulb and the prismatic effect of its interior design make for a version of the Ledare somewhat reminiscent of the soon-to-be-released  Philips Clear LED . Though not quite as eye-catching as that bulb's sparkling design, the clear Ledare might still be an attractive option for anyone looking to fill an exposed bulb aesthetic.

As for the bulb's engineering, the Ledare uses 10 watts of electricity to put out 600 lumens, a number that falls shy of the 800 lumens you'd typically expect from a 60W replacement. It's also not as efficient as other LEDs, which are often capable of doing more with less. The  Cree 60W Replacement LED , for instance, puts out 800 lumens using 9.5 watts.

Still, like those other bulbs, the Ledare promises a significant efficiency upgrade when compared with incandescents. That's probably good enough for consumers who don't want to split hairs, but the bulb's dimmer-than-average light output might be a tougher sell.

Another engineering factor worth considering is the bulb's dimming performance. The Ledare claims full compatibility with built-in dimmer switches, and sure enough, both versions worked with every switch in our lab when we tested them.

Compatibility isn't the end of the story, though. In many cases, electromagnetic resistance generated by the dimming mechanism can cause dimmable bulbs of all kinds to buzz and flicker as you dial the light up and down.

The Ledare was no exception. Both the clear and frosted versions of the bulb produced a slight buzz on each of the dimmers we tested, and also a very slight flicker when dimmed down below 50 percent (you can check out  our full set of flicker grids for a closer look at dimming performance).

To be fair, both the buzzing and flickering were minor, and certainly not as noticeable as the worst performers from  our recent round of dimmability tests. Still, if you're looking for an LED to use with an in-wall dimmer switch, I'd recommend spending the extra money on the  Philips 60W Equivalent LED , as it dimmed flawlessly when we tested it out.

One last thing worth considering is the bulb's warranty -- the Ledare offers none. This puts it in stark contrast with the competition, particularly Cree, which warranties its LEDs for 10 years. Bulbs like those might seem like significantly better deals to consumers who aren't yet sold on LED longevity claims.

At 600 lumens, the Ikea Ledare LED sits closer to the 450 lumens you can expect from a 40W replacement than the 800 lumens you'll typically get from a 60W replacement -- at least on paper. I was eager to screw one in and see for myself how bright it was, or wasn't.

As it turns out, the numbers don't lie. Compare the Ledare LED with the 60w and 40w replacements from a brand like Philips or Cree, and you'll find that its light output falls right in the middle, and perhaps slightly closer to the 40W side of things.

Ikea balances this underwhelming brightness by dialing up another key lighting spec -- the CRI number. The CRI, or color rendering index, measures how accurately a light source will illuminate colors. A bulb with a higher CRI number should do a better job of bringing out the natural tones and colors in your home.

Most LEDs score somewhere around 80 out of 100, but the Ledare LEDs claim an impressive score of 87. That puts them just south of high-end bulbs like the  Cree TW Series LED  and the  GE Reveal LED, which both claim CRI scores in the low 90s.

If you look back to the four-way comparison shot above, you can definitely see that the Ikea LED's color quality looks a little more natural and less yellow than either of the Cree bulbs, and more in line with what you'll get from an incandescent.

Taking a closer look at the bulb's color rendering capabilities confirms that it offers a legitimate upgrade over much of the competition. Putting a bowl of peanut M&Ms under the Ikea light produces color accuracy that falls almost directly in between what you'll get with a standard LED and what you'll see if you use a high-end light like the GE Reveal that promises an especially high CRI score.

In addition to testing out the Ledare's color-rendering capabilities, we took a close look at its color temperature, a term which refers to the specific tone of the light itself. Both the frosted and clear versions of the Ledare LED are rated at 2,700 K, which puts it squarely on the warm, yellow end of the spectrum.

Interestingly, the frosted version gets a lot closer to the target, with a measured color temperature of 2,632 K. The clear version was barely able to register above 2,500 K, though the high CRI seems to keep the yellows in check.

Our final piece of performance testing looked to examine the bulb's light output over time. Reading up on the bulb, I had seen some comments that suggested the Ledare seemed to grow dimmer while in use. This isn't unusual -- all LEDs will see a very slight downtick in brightness during the initial 30 to 45 minutes after being switched on, which is exactly what you get with the Ledare LEDs.

The reason for this slight drop in brightness has to do with the heat produced by the bulb, which affects the performance of the hardware inside. Just like with a phone or a laptop, the hotter things get, the more performance suffers.

The initial drop in brightness is just the bulb responding to the initial rise in heat. Once the temperature stabilizes after that first half hour or so, the brightness will stabilize, too, which is why you don't see a brightness change from 45 minutes to two hours in the timelapse GIF posted above. It's also worth noting that Energy Star requires lighting manufacturers to measure and rate the light output of their bulbs in the""steady state"" after the initial dropoff, so you shouldn't ever get shortchanged from the number of lumens printed on the box.

At less than $5 per bulb, the Ikea Ledare LEDs represent a very solid value option in the ever-evolving lighting landscape. I'm not a fan of the diminished light output or the lack of a warranty, but given that the bulbs cost less then half of what you'll spend for a quality competitor like the Cree 60W Replacement LED, it's hard to take Ikea to task. Factor in the focus on color rendering, and you've got a low-cost lighting option that doesn't quite feel cheap. If that's not Ikea's MO, I don't know what is."
Low-cost Clime sensors bring home automation to the masses|"

Krakow, Poland-based duo Bart Zimny and Andrzej Pawlikowski are developing mini battery-powered sensors called Clime. These gizmos are supposed to be able to measure things like temperature, humidity, light, motion, CO2, pressure, and color. And setup appears to be as simple as sticking a Clime sensor to a surface and letting it communicate all of its handy environmental readings to the related app via Bluetooth 4.0.

Here's their vision: Leave a sensor outside and let it adjust your thermostat when it detects temperature changes. Add a motion-sensing Clime to your washing machine and receive an alert on your phone when the cleaning cycle is complete. Let a Clime sensor keep track of ambient light and trigger your fixtures to turn on when it gets dark outside. Each sensor should last for up to 1.5  years before needing a new battery.

The team clearly has big plans for Clime -- including third-party integrations and IFTTT compatibility -- but they aren't quite there yet.

Zimny and Pawlikowski have launched their own pre-order/crowd-funding campaign where you can contribute anything from $1 to $7,000. They focused on affordable home automation with Clime and expect to start shipping their sensors in early 2015 -- one temperature and motion sensor costs $26.

That's a good price, but I'm fairly certain that scattering several of these small sensors around my house would end badly. I'm a little foggy on how these devices stick to things and how well they stay in place.  At least at $26 a pop, I wouldn't feel too bad if my dog eats one -- or several.

Clime sensors remind me of Dropcam's $29  Tabs sensors  designed to measure both movement and motion -- just with more potential applications. They also offer a lot of the extra features that come with  Piper  -- a $199 all-in-one security system that monitors both environmental and security triggers. But it's probably most similar to the $180  Netatmo Weather Station , an IFTTT-compatible product that can track everything from humidity to ambient noise. I've asked for a Clime sensor to review, so stay tuned to see if it can deliver a Netatmo level of information at a fraction of the price."
Novi brings a new level of simplicity to DIY security|"

Apartment dwellers, listen up. The Novi by Novi Security is a portable $199 (about £116 or AU$362.70) battery-powered monitor that can sense smoke and motion and send you picture notifications when something's amiss. Basically, Novi Security took what looks like a plain ol' smoke detector and hid an HD camera, a motion sensor, and a siren inside too.

While there are several DIY security systems that offer great features and incredible design, the Novi presents an intriguing, pared-down alternative. Not everyone wants a  design-oriented DIY security system  that might pique the curiosity of potential intruders rather than deter them. The Novi might be preferable for others, since it's a modern, app-enabled system that's also largely camouflaged by its nondescript smoke detector exterior.

This may not make the Novi the sleekest DIY home security system we've seen, but it might just end up being one of the smartest.

The Novi system consists of a base station, a ceiling-mounted monitor, and an app. When it detects motion or smoke activity, the following is supposed to happen: an alarm will sound, the monitor will send three images to the base station, and the base station will transmit the photos to the Novi app. Once you receive the alert, you have several options that you can access directly from the app: call 911, call home, disarm, or request another image.

While a lot of DIY systems are essentially fee-free, they have  optional fee-based plans  for video storage and professional monitoring. Since the Novi is strictly photo-based, there aren't any monthly fees. It's limited for sure, but it's also one of the most straightforward systems we've come across -- one that could appeal to folks who move around a lot and still want the basics of DIY home security.

Still, the Novi has some drawbacks that border on deal breakers. The base station doesn't have a backup battery and the monitor doesn't have cellular backup, so you're totally out of luck if your home temporarily loses power or Internet access. But, if Novi Security reaches its $150,000 stretch goal on Kickstarter (its original goal was $80,000 and it has already raised $111,014), the startup plans to add additional features that might turn the Novi into a solid entry-level home security option.

You can get your own Novi kit with a minimum pledge of $199 (about £116 or AU$362.70). Units are expected to ship in January 2015; add $40 (about £23.30, AU$42.40) to ship outside the United States."
Cree 60W Replacement LED review:|"

Being that you're a reader of light bulb reviews, I'm going to assume that this likely isn't the first you've seen of the Cree 60W Replacement LED. By most accounts, the bulb was the rookie of the year in 2013, with impressive specs, a generous warranty, and a low price point that forced the rest of the field to play catch up.

Cree's been building off of that success in 2014 with an expanded lineup of residential LEDs for North American consumers, including  brighter bulbs ,  new shapes and designs , and even a long clamored-for  three-way LED . As for the 60W replacement that started it all, Cree cut its price even further, down to $10. Even now, with more options -- and more legitimate competition -- than ever before, Cree's original LED remains one of the top standard bearers of the lighting aisle.

The Cree 60W Replacement LED features a design that's focused on familiarity, which puts it right in line with the rest of Cree's residential lighting lineup. Cree isn't trying to rock the boat with an outside-the-box bulb design like the one you'll get with the Philips SlimStyle, and that might help the 60W replacement seem more accessible to fans of incandescents -- if not slightly disappointing to to design-minded amateur futurists.

Still, it's obvious from looking at this LED that it isn't an incandescent. The conspicuous collar of heat sinks around the neck of the bulb is arguably an eyesore when compared with other bulbs that sport more modern, more streamlined designs.

The look of the bulb is likely a moot point if you're going to use it behind a lamp shade, but if you're looking for an LED that'll fit into an exposed bulb aesthetic, something like the  Philips Clear LED  might be a better choice.

That said, there's a lot more to light bulb design than aesthetics. Removing the Cree's rubbery globe reveals a tower-like fixture, with the yellow diodes serving as the windows. This is a design departure from much of the competition. The standard  Philips 60W Equivalent LED  keeps its diodes flat against the bottom of the bulb, for instance.

This tower approach might help the Cree LED achieve its omnidirectional light output, although competitors who keep their diodes in bed at the bottom don't seem to have much trouble with directionality, if any. The more likely benefit is a cosmetic one -- with the diodes extended up into the center of the globe, the light source more closely resembles an incandescent filament.

Another cosmetic concern involves dimming performance. Most bulbs -- incandescents included -- will flicker and buzz to a certain extent when used with in-wall dimmer switches. Cree's LED is no exception. While not nearly as bad as some of the worst offenders we discovered in  our recent roundup, there's still a faint, noticeable buzz, along with a small amount of flicker when you dim the Cree LED down past 50 percent brightness.

The Cree 60W Replacement LED puts out 800 lumens using 9.5 watts, giving it a very impressive efficiency rating of 84.21 lumens per watt. That's better than any other 60W replacement bulb that we've tested.

The light that Cree's LED puts out is rated at 2,700 K -- the same low, warm color temperature as you'll get with a standard incandescent. When we put that figure to the test in front of our spectrometer, we got a reading of 2,669 K, which is closer to the mark than any of Cree's closest competitors. Shining the Cree LED over a piece of paper for a quick eye test confirms that the color temperature is more or less spot on.

For those who like their light more on the hot end of the spectrum, Cree also sells a ""Daylight"" version of the 60W replacement that costs a dollar more and carries a color temperature of 5,000 K. This gives the light a bright white appearance that borders on bluish. If you aren't a fan of that sort of hot, white light, then you'll want to be sure and shop carefully -- the two bear packaging that's nearly identical, and typically sit right next to one another on the shelf at Home Depot.

In addition to color temperature, we also make sure to test the color rendering capabilities of each bulb that we review. Unlike color temperature, which indicates the tone of the light itself, color rendering refers to the light's ability to accurately illuminate the natural colors of other objects. A bulb with a high color-rendering score should be able to make reds look red and blues look blue better than one with a low color-rendering score would.

This ""color rendering index,"" or CRI score, is actually an average of several different scores for several different tones. Incandescent light scores very well across the board, and pure sunlight scores a perfect 100.

LEDs, however, tend to have more difficulty getting that sort of universal color quality. The weak point is almost always red tones, and that's certainly the case with Cree's LED, which put up the worst red numbers from any of the bulbs we've examined. In the graph above, column number 9 represents its score with pure red, and as you can see, it's pretty abysmal.

This isn't to say that a bowl of red delicious apples illuminated by the Cree bulb would suddenly look blue, but their particular shade of red likely wouldn't look quite as vivid or accurate as it would under a bulb with a better CRI score.

For some, this is likely a minor, unnoticeable quibble, but for those concerned with color quality, it could be a reason to go with another bulb. The  GE Reveal LED boasts especially strong CRI performance, as does  Cree's own TW Series LED  -- both score in the 90s, and might merit consideration.

Like the majority of LEDs on the market, the Cree bulb promises a lifespan of 25,000 hours -- well over 20 years if used for an average of 3 hours a day. Cree takes things a step further, however, by backing that lifespan up with a 10-year warranty. That's twice as long as what you'll get from Philips or GE -- both of which make 60W replacements that cost more than Cree's does.

Overall, the Cree 60W Replacement LED offers outstanding value, and lives up to its reputation as a lighting aisle best buy. At $10 each (or lower, if you live in an area that offers energy rebates), you'll be getting a reliable, high quality light that's designed to last decades and warrantied accordingly. The value grows exponentially if you're upgrading from incandescents -- swap out just a few bulbs, and you'll make a noticeable dent in your monthly energy bill.

All that said, Cree's original LED isn't in quite as dominant a position as it was in last year, when the lack of affordable competition made it all but a no-brainer. Since then, prices have fallen faster than anticipated, and the emergence of bulbs like the low-cost Philips SlimStyle (and even $5 LEDs at Ikea) have given consumers more options worth considering, not to mention new, design-minded LEDs like the  Philips Clear , which seem to hold some distinct appeal of their own. Cree is still a pack leader -- but the race is getting increasingly tight."
Honeywell Lyric Thermostat review:|"

I really liked the $249  Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat  I reviewed last year, but its utilitarian design doesn't appeal to the same category of consumer as the  Nest Learning Thermostat  (also $249), even though it was very similar in terms of features and performance.

Nest fans are looking for solid performance, innovative features, and statement-making design, which is a tough combination to find in the thermostat industry. But unlike Honeywell's previous Wi-Fi thermostats, the $279 Lyric matches the precedent set by Nest, giving it the potential to pose a very real threat to this still-niche market -- at least someday.

While the geofencing feature promises the utmost convenience for those of you with impossible-to-predict schedules, the thermostat would occasionally and inexplicably revert back to Away mode, even when I was at home. I also found the iOS app glitchy (an Android app is also available) and the setup challenging. I'd hold off on the Lyric for now, but a few key tweaks could change everything in its favor.

Honeywell's Lyric thermostat is a white, circular thermostat that comes with two screws, a AAA lithium battery, and a round baseplate. The baseplate is optional, depending on your need to strategically cover any holes or mismatched paint. The Lyric measures three inches in diameter and one inch deep.

Unlike Honeywell's other Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats, the Lyric doesn't require a C, or ""common,"" wire to operate. Instead, you can install the Lyric using the same wire configuration as the Nest, which worked out well for me because my system doesn't have a C wire.

So, I turned off the AC and furnace at my circuit breaker, removed my old thermostat, noted the wiring, and made sure everything was correctly labeled -- I have G, W, Y, and Rh wires, but my Y wire is light blue rather than yellow so it's nice to have that information recorded somewhere. I fed the wires through the baseplate and the base of the thermostat and screwed them into the wall.

The Lyric app walks you through the entire setup process, including everything from removing your old thermostat to connecting your new Lyric to your home Wi-Fi. Here's where I started running through the app instructions as a guide and ran into something confusing. The app asks you to list your wires and then shows you how to install them.

Interestingly, the app told me to hook up the G, W, and Y wires only. I know that the Rh wire, which can double as the R wire, was needed to power the system, so I hooked all four wires up anyway. This was my first usability snag with the Lyric. When in doubt, double-check your wiring setup with a knowledgeable friend -- in this case, the app was actually wrong.

Then, I snapped the faceplate on and turned the AC and furnace back on at the breaker. The thermostat began to power up, showing the Lyric product name on the display and a ring of lights around it that illuminated slowly over two to three minutes as the thermostat turned on fully.

Next came the configuration process, which is simple if you know basic info about your heating and cooling system -- fuel source, cooling stages, and so on. Connecting the thermostat is the next step, and this gave me the most trouble by far. I followed the steps exactly to add the Honeywell Lyric network to the Wi-Fi and then input the details for my home Wi-Fi, but I kept getting the same error: ""I can't connect. Make sure DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is enabled on your router.""

Now, DHCP is required for this setup, but I logged into my Netgear router and confirmed that it was already enabled. I tried a couple of other fixes to no avail and eventually decided to try a different brand router after reading this forum, which discusses networking issues between certain routers and Honeywell thermostats (although no one named the Lyric specifically).

I was able to connect immediately after that, but at what point does this stop being a simple DIY installation? Most people would have to pay an expert to try to fix the router issue, buy a new router, or give up on the install completely. Installing and setting up the Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat was much easier than this, even though I didn't have the required C wire. I asked Honeywell about this networking issue and was told that ""it should work with most routers."" Hm.

Around this time, I also got a low-battery notification and searched around my house for AAA batteries. I tried a few that were half-used from remotes and other small gadgets, but none of them worked -- it still said ""low battery."" Turns out, you really do need a AAA lithium battery for the Lyric, which are more expensive but last longer. I bought a pack and it began to work again.

Registering your address for the geofencing feature and giving your thermostat a name is the final step in the setup process. The geofencing feature autodefaults to a 7-mile radius, but that's not helpful if you live in an urban area and have a 1-mile commute, so you can go into your phone's settings, find the Lyric app, and enable ""small geofences."" That changes the radius to 500 feet. Now you're ready to start using your thermostat.

The functionality on the thermostat itself is fairly simple. A cloud button on the left will give you the daily forecast, and the house button on the right will switch your thermostat to Away mode. You can also use the smaller display on the top to switch between Off, Heating, and Cooling. Use the radial dial to adjust the temperature to a new set point and the larger display will update as the temperature changes to match the new setting.

You can set all of the basics on the app, but there are also a lot of other features worth exploring. You can set ""shortcuts"" on the app, which is the same as establishing custom settings for your heating and cooling system. You can ask it to trigger a response based on a handful of useful options: when you press a shortcut, when it's a specific time, when your house is empty, or when someone is at home, something else happens. For example, ""When someone is at home, use Home setting."" This shortcut uses the geofencing feature to track the location of your phone and from there, to determine if you're home or away.

Depending on the default you use for geofencing -- either 500 feet or 7 miles -- your thermostat will automatically change to Away mode when you leave. The same goes for returning home. Once you cross that distance threshold, it will begin heating or cooling your house to your preferred Home mode settings.

While this feature generally worked, I did experience some anomalies that left me puzzled. Occasionally, the thermostat would switch back to ""away"" mode after I had returned home. I also enabled notifications for both geofencing and manual shortcuts, but never received a message. Instead, I got a lot of error messages like the one above. I tried uninstalling the app and starting over, but nothing seemed to help.

So, I had to pay very close attention to the Away and Home temperature settings to confirm that they had, in fact switched to the correct mode. Even more confusingly, I couldn't find that the app labels your Home or Away settings at all when it's initiated via geofencing. That's yet another failed line of defense that makes it tough to tell if your thermostat is actually in fact set to the desired setting.

While the $279 Lyric is a welcome addition to the smart thermostat market -- and the closest we've seen to a true Nest competitor -- a few performance and usability quirks make it hard to recommend today. But, if Honeywell can fix the networking incompatibility issues (or at least provide more information on its site so you can check your router's compatibility in advance), fix the messaging errors, and solve the odd geofencing wishy-washiness, the Lyric has a ton of potential.

If you're set on a Honeywell product and plan to purchase soon, I'd stick with the $249  Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat  -- it may be lacking in design, but it was reliable and accurate. And if you prefer the geofencing feature over the learning algorithm, the Lyric can do the trick, but you might experience some of the same annoying inconsistencies I encountered along the way."
Philips 60W Equivalent LED review:|"

For $15, the Philips 60W equivalent LED offers American consumers massive boosts in efficiency and longevity over the incandescents it was designed to replace. Of course, the same can be said of just about any LED you'll find sitting on the shelf of your local lighting aisle.

If you want to know what makes the Philips LED (or any LED) stand out, you need to know what you'll have to compromise in exchange for that extra efficiency. With some bulbs, it's color quality or brightness; with others, it's things like dimmability or directionality. With the Philips LED, there's very little compromising to be done. You might wish that it cost a few dollars less, but the Philips LED is about as well-rounded a bulb as you'll find, and well worth it if you plan on dimming your lights.

Philips has been making flat-topped household LEDs for a while now, and the current bulb (model number 9290002268) doesn't deviate much from what Philips has already done. Along with the previous generations, the bulb shares its shape with the app-enabled, color-changing  Philips Hue LEDs , along with the upcoming  Philips Hue Lux LEDs . If you're looking for a bulb that's designed to stand out, you'll want to check out the Philips SlimStyle and  Philips Clear LEDs , which both put a strong emphasis on unique, eye-catching looks.

The Philips LED sports a build that's slightly heavier than some of the other LEDs we've looked at. At 4.55 ounces, it's almost a full ounce heavier than  the comparable 60W replacement from Cree , and more than twice as weighty as the ping pong paddle-esque Philips SlimStyle. All but the flimsiest of flex lamps should be able to support its weight without issue, but it still might be something worth consideration.

In terms of of intangibles, this is a bulb that checks off all the boxes you'll likely be looking for. It's Energy Star certified. It's omnidirectional. It's fully dimmable. This last point is an especially strong one for Philips, as its LED not only works with common in-wall dimmer switches, but also works well with them. In all of our tests, it produced little to no detectable buzz or flicker -- even with older switches that weren't designed with LEDs in mind.

This lack of buzz speaks well to the bulb's construction. Wall dimmers will generate electromagnetic resistance as they dim the light, which can cause bulb components to vibrate and buzz (a fairly common problem, as  our recent testing showed). Philips came out on top in our buzz tests, with near-silent performance that's indicative of tight, thoughtful engineering inside the bulb.

Our LED performance tests involve a mix of everyday use scenarios and lab-based data collection using equipment like a spectrometer and a variac transformer. The latter half obviously gets a bit wonky, but the short of it is that we work to get an objective look at things like brightness, color quality, and efficiency.

Philips calls their bulb a 60W equivalent, and rightly so, considering that it puts out 830 lumens' worth of light. This is a small bump up from the amount of brightness that you'll get with most 60W replacements, where 800 lumens is the popular benchmark. Compared to the standard 60W replacements from brands like Cree and GE, Philips can claim to be the brightest, albeit just slightly so.

We can also take a nice, close look at color temperature, and how accurately each bulb hits the tone that it's rated for. With the Philips LED, that color temperature is 2,700K, a very popular tone that's often referred to as ""soft white."" Lots of bulbs aim for this warm, incandescent-esque color temperature.

Philips overshoots things just a bit, with a color temperature that's lower and noticeably warmer than 2,700K. To be specific, we clocked the Philips LED at 2,584K, which is still close enough to look ""right,"" but not as close as Cree, which comes in at 2,669K.

The performance distinction between the two bulbs is a pretty fine one, but if you want the light that will mimic the specific warmth of incandescent lighting the best, you might want to consider Cree. Then again, if you enjoy that incandescent warmth and want even more of it, then the lower color temperature of the Philips LED might actually be a plus in your book.

In addition to color temperature we make sure to test for color quality, too. What's the difference? Color temperature describes the color of the light itself, color quality tells us how accurately a light will render the specific colors of the objects its illuminating. Color quality is measured using the color rendering index (CRI), which is an average of scores for each color. A higher CRI number means more vivid, accurate looking colors in your living room.

The Philips LED is rated with a CRI of 81 out of 100, which is pretty average for an LED. We tested the bulb out in front of our own spectrometer to take a closer look at its color rendering capabilities, the results of which you can see pretty plainly in that color-coded graph up above.

As you can see, performance plummets with reds, a problem that's fairly universal with LEDs (Cree's bulb scored even worse, posting a red score of -1). This isn't to say that an apple sitting under a Philips LED won't look red -- it just won't look as red as an apple sitting in direct sunlight, where the CRI is a perfect 100. (For more about LEDs and CRI scores, be sure and check out our  recent face-off between the Cree TW Series and GE Reveal LEDs, both of which promise CRI scores up in the 90s.)

All things considered, the Philips 60W Equivalent LED is a very well-rounded light, and one that merits consideration right up alongside the comparable  Cree 60W Replacement LED  as a potential best buy. The Philips LED is the brighter of the two, and it performs better with built-in dimmer switches, which I imagine for many consumers will rightly tip the scales in its favor.

Still, the Philips' LED isn't quite as efficient as Cree, its warranty is half as long, and it costs $5 more, which is far from insignificant, especially if you're replacing an entire home's worth of bulbs. Bargain shoppers might want to keep their eye on the Philips SlimStyle, which currently retails for $9, but overall, unless I'm looking for a bulb to use with a dimmer switch, I'm sticking with Cree as my standard LED of choice."
Archos aims its arrow at home automation|"

Archos  is the company behind one of the very first Android-run tablets. It also sells app-enabled gadgets like this Bluetooth scale. Now, it's taking home automation to the next level with a preorderable $250 Smart Home starter pack, which is also available for preorder in the UK for £199.99.

This kit includes a tablet, two small cameras, two movement sensor ""tags,"" and two environmental sensors designed to track temperature and humidity. There's no need for a separate hub since the hardware is paired to the tablet and the related Archos Smart Home Android and iOS apps via Bluetooth 4.0. And, you will be able to buy individual add-on devices starting at $25 -- a smart plug, a siren, and a movement sensor ""ball"" are slated to be released soon.

The $3 Tasker app is also compatible with this system, allowing Android users to do more advanced customization. This Archos Smart Home system is also supposed to work with select 433MHz radio frequency products. That way, you can work your garage door opener and other devices into Archos' central hub and operate everything from the same place.

While this starter pack sounds somewhat similar to the  Sentri ,  Piper , and  Canary  systems in terms of features, the Archos system feels much less accessible. $250 isn't unreasonable, but how much more affordable would it be without the tablet? Sentri offers a screen interface as well, but its camera, motion sensor, and environmental sensors are also built into the unit, making it a logical, centralized hub.

If the Archos mobile app displays the same information, I'd rather skip the tablet altogether. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be an option with Archos' Smart Home starter pack, making the kit feel somewhat overpriced. Still, there might be a market for a tablet-centric home automation system. Android users: Is this the kit you've been waiting for?"
Sentri review:|"

Kronosight, a startup composed of Asus, Acer and HTC alums, launched a Kickstarter campaign in June of 2014 for Sentri, a $299 DIY home security system with a distinct Apple vibe.  By the end of its funding period, the tablet-security system hybrid had nearly doubled its original $200,000 goal. A year and a half later and we finally have a Sentri in-house to test out.

It's clear what Sentri is trying to achieve here -- it's a DIY Wi-Fi-enabled home security system and an at-a-glance access point to the indoor temperature, humidity and air quality, as well as local weather. The touchscreen doesn't have full tablet functionality -- you can't browse the internet or download your favorite app -- but it does present basic security and environmental details in an entirely new way. No app required (although yes, it has one).

The problem is that even though Sentri boasts a unique design, the pricey touchscreen tablet display doesn't actually add much value. Security systems like Icontrol's Piper Classic and Piper NV are also equipped with environmental sensors and other advanced features, but their sleek aesthetics err on the side of discretion, rather than Sentri's comparatively clunky tablet touchscreen; it's the kind of device that could be more of a beacon for potential intruders than a true deterrent.

Yes, Sentri looks neat and it works fairly well, but I'd stick with something a bit more streamlined for home security.

Sentri doesn't look like a security system, but it has a lot of the same features as  Icontrol's Piper Classic and Piper NV, two highly rated all-in-one home security cameras  and  Canary, a less effective Piper-competitor. The main difference between them and Sentri lies in design execution.

Where Piper and Canary are controlled entirely on their related apps, Sentri adds a home screen interface where you can access details directly, like the current temperature, humidity, weather and air quality. Each Sentri also has a built-in 720p HD camera, siren, motion detector, microphone and speaker, as well as night-vision capabilities, but you can access even more from the Sentri Android or iOS app, including live streaming. Sentri is also compatible with the Nest Learning Thermostat, Philips Hue LEDs and Belkin WeMo products.

Specifically, Sentri is a 10-inch tall by 10-inch wide tabletesque device with a 120-degree camera at the top and a smaller, banner-style touchscreen display in the middle (think older-gen iPhones that had a lot of ""dead space"" above and below the display). It's made of white and gray plastic and has a built-in stand for sticking your Sentri on a flat surface -- and slots for mounting it to a wall.

It would look a little weird to mount this thing to a wall, though, since it has to be connected to its power adapter to function properly. To avoid having a cord hanging down the wall, I relied on the included stand and simply stuck Sentri on a table.

""Installing"" Sentri is as simple as connecting the power adapter, entering your Wi-Fi details and registering your device with your email address and a password. You'll receive a verification email to confirm your set up. After that, you can download the Sentri app on your Android or iOS device and use the same email and password you used to register the device as your log-in.

Sentri's tablet offers roughly the same features and functionality as the app and both are easy to navigate -- the main difference is that you can only access live streaming from the app.

From the Sentri device you can swipe left or right to scroll between the ""home screen"" and other settings. In particular, you can manually opt-in or -out of Away (alerts enabled) and Home modes (alerts disabled), make general adjustments to the brightness of the screen, choose whether you want to view temperature readings in Fahrenheit or Celsius, change the background wallpaper, connect to a different Wi-Fi network and switch to a different cloud storage plan. Sentri users have free access to cloud-stored photos, videos and alert logs for one month. After that, you have the option to upgrade to a ""premium plan.""

There are four premium options -- 7 days of storage for $10 per month; 30 days for $20 per month; one year for $100 per month; and $300 per month to keep your photos, videos and alert logs forever. (Icontrol offers free cloud storage.)

The main ""home screen"" provides the current time, indoor temperature, humidity and air quality (in parts per million) and the current forecast. And, two shortcuts in the top right corner direct you to settings or to the activity log.  The activity log shows a rundown of the activity Sentri has detected, including time-stamped alerts, saved video clips and more.

A final screen in the app lets you add a new device, including Nest, Belkin WeMo and Philips Hue products.

It is relatively simple to swipe through the various screens and access settings, the home screen, the activity log and the ""add a device"" section. But, the touchscreen does have a slight delay -- it just doesn't have the same responsiveness that you'll find with a standard smartphone or tablet. For that reason, I preferred to use the app. There's also the added bonus of the app offering remote access wherever your phone has either a Wi-Fi or a cellular connection.

While the touchscreen works fine, it's pretty redundant -- unless you want a connected security device without having to rely entirely on an app.

Overall, Sentri performed fine. Whenever I triggered the motion detector, I received a prompt alert on my phone that said, ""Activity detected at CNET Sentri."" Then you can view the activity log in the app or on Sentri itself and review saved clips. It also lets you know when it has been unplugged or moved.

It's also easy to access the live stream in the app -- but, the video quality was disappointing. The Sentri team claims 720p HD quality, but that wasn't my experience during testing. In fact, pixelation and overexposure at close range seriously hurt its performance.

Also, while Sentri has a siren, there aren't any rules in place that you can opt into that would automatically turn on the siren. Comparable models, like Icontrol's Piper NV has custom rules that you can set, such as, ""If Piper is armed and detects motion, then sound alarm.""

Icontrol's approach is pretty intuitive, but you have to manually press Sentri's ""Siren"" button in the app to turn on the alarm. Even though the alarm does work, it isn't very loud and the lack of custom rules majorly limit its functionality.

The Sentri team also says that its units can work as hubs for integration with third-party smart lights, outlets and thermostats. Right now, it lists Nest, Belkin WeMo and Philips Hue as its partnered integrations.

Since we had some Philips Hue bulbs handy at the office, I followed the steps on the Sentri touchscreen to connect them.

This process was very simple -- select add a new device, select Philips Hue, and press the button in the center of the Philips Hue hub. It connected quickly and I was able to control the LEDs in the office from both the Sentri app and the device itself.

However, when I returned to the app for testing the next day, the Hue LEDs were no longer listed as paired products and I had to connect the bulbs to Sentri all over again.

That's what Sentri offers right now in terms of third-party integrations. But, it is supposed to be able to recognize any device with an open API/SDK, so there's potential to add more official partners over time.

Sentri is a decent DIY security system, but it's disappointing HD video quality, counter-intuitive siren feature, lack of rules and glitchy third-party integrations make Icontrol's Piper Classic and Piper NV more appealing options overall.

There's a question of value with Sentri, too. Sure, it sort of looks like an older-gen iPad, but I can actually buy an actual older-gen iPad for less than the $299 Sentri. In that case, maybe it would make even more sense to get the iPad, download the free Manything iOS app and use it in combination with IFTTT to watch over your home instead. Either way, Sentri still has some kinks to work out before I can recommend it."
Lutron Smart Bridge review:|"

The $150 Lutron Smart Bridge turns Lutron's un-smart dimmer products into Wi-Fi-enabled home automation pros. While the Smart Bridge and corresponding app work incredibly well, $150 feels excessive for light-dimming capabilities. Tack on an additional $55 for a single, two-outlet dimmer plug and you've spent over $200 to control a maximum of two lamps.

Yes, $205 is a ridiculous sum to pay for a smart plug-in lamp dimmer, but Lutron is one of the only companies offering this functionality. Right now, the hub is only compatible with Caseta Wireless dimmers and Serena battery-powered window shades, but Lutron has plans to add  Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostats , and a new line of GE LEDs to its cache of integrated products. As this list expands, it will be much easier to recommend the Lutron Smart Bridge.

The Lutron Smart Bridge is a small square gizmo that you connect directly to your router using the included Ethernet cable. There's also a power adapter that you plug into a regular two-prong outlet and into the micro-USB port on the Smart Bridge hub. A ring of LEDs around the perimeter of the hub will let you know when it's powered on. Press the button on the hub to add new devices to the app.

The app won't be available until June 30, so I used a beta version on an  iPhone 5  and a first-generation Asus Nexus 7 tablet. Even in beta, the app was very thoughtfully designed. Download the app on your Android or iOS device and follow the instructions to connect your Lutron-enabled devices. Lutron sent me two Caseta Wireless plug-in lamp dimmers, one Pico remote, and the Smart Bridge for testing.

The plug-in dimmers have four buttons. The top button turns the lamp on, the bottom button turns it off, and the two arrow buttons in the middle allow you to set the level of light for dimming. The Pico remote has the same exact design, except for a ""favorite"" button in the middle that lets you program a frequently used light level.

First, I had to install the lamp dimmer. This plug-in module has two outlets, one on either side, and works with LEDS, CFLs, incandescents, and halogens; I focused on LEDs and tested six different dimmable brands during the review. To install, simply switch the lamp you want to control to the ""on"" position and unplug it. Then plug the lamp or lamps into the dimmer and then into the wall outlet.

I connected two table lamps to one of the modules and one floor lamp to the other. Then, since I also had a Pico remote, I paired the dimmers with the remotes by holding the off button for 6 seconds until the LED started blinking. Then I pressed and held the same button on the remote control for 6 seconds until it flashed three times, meaning it was successfully paired. To adjust the favorite setting (its default is a 50 percent light level) you set the desired level of light on the dimmer and then hold down the favorite button for 6 seconds until it blinks twice.

Once that was set up, I was able to go back to the app and complete the setup process. I created a username and password for the app, plugged the Ethernet cord and power adapter into the Smart Bridge, and paired the single floor lamp and the two table lamps with the app. Then, I sent the Pico remote to control all three lamps at the same time.

From there, you can start playing around with light levels and setting schedules based on your preferences. Setup takes roughly 30 minutes, but is very simple. I like that you can adjust the lamp via the plug-in module itself, on the Pico remote, or on the app. The app has the most features, though, since you can set several different schedules.

I tested it out by adjusting light levels, switching out different LEDs from brands including Switch, Utilitech, Cree, Philips, and GE, and setting a variety of schedules. It consistently performed well, but a couple of potential usage problems did stand out. If you plan to control more than one lamp at the same time, they might not all turn on, off, or dim at the same rate. Also, one out of the six dimmable LEDs I tested (the Switch Infinia bulb) had a noticeable flicker when it transitioned away from off on the dimmer scale, although that's more a function of the LED than the dimmer.

While it did a fantastic job overall, the $150 price for the hub, plus an additional $55 for a single dimmer or $60 for a single dimmer plus one Pico remote, is too high. For $200-plus I think it should have more features and more third-party integration. And I'd like to see the ability to opt into scheduling notifications. That way, you could receive an alert when your light turns on at a certain time.

An alarm feature would also be quite useful. If you can program a lamp and a battery-powered window shade to turn on and open at a certain time, an alarm seems like a logical addition to round out the whole morning routine.  IFTTT compatibility might make sense here, too, since you could set custom recipes that adjust lights and blinds based on weather reports or other useful triggers.

Excluding smart LEDs like  Philips Hue  bulbs that incorporate dimmer features, there aren't many smart dimmers available today (particularly of  the plug-in or wall-mounted variety). A startup called Plum is now accepting preorders for $89 Wi-Fi Lightpad dimmers, $89 Wi-Fi smart plugs, and $89 Wi-Fi duplex electrical outlets. The dimmers are more expensive than Lutron's, but Plum's products don't need a hub to work. The same goes for  Belkin's WeMo switches  and the  D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug , but none of them offer dimmer functionality.

Lutron is one of the only big-name brands offering a smart dimmer solution that goes beyond a bulb with built-in tech. It's also making a clear effort to move toward a more comprehensive home automation package. So, if you want a smart-home setup complete with dimmers, battery-powered window shades, smart thermostats, and LED bulbs, Lutron is working toward that goal. But it isn't there yet.

Once that happens, this $150 Smart Bridge will be a lot easier to justify. The Smart Bridge isn't even available until September 1, so I'd suggest buying a $60 plug-in dimmer and a Pico remote kit (you can also buy the dimmer and remote separately for $55 and $15) to see how you like the functionality and then consider adding the Smart Bridge later if you want more advanced scheduling features and the option of adding other Lutron-compatible devices."
Samsung gets into the smart lighting game with a Bluetooth-enabled LED bulb|"

We heard whispers back at CES that Samsung would be making some smart-lighting moves in 2014, and in March, the tech giant made things official by announcing a new Bluetooth-enabled smart LED. We learned a little more last week at Lightfair International, where Samsung showcased the new bulb as part of its expanded lighting lineup, shining a spotlight on the ""industry-first mesh Bluetooth network"" that powers its smarts.

That Bluetooth connection also means that the new smart bulb won't require a hub, but instead will connect directly with your phone. Samsung claims you'll be able to control up to 64 of them from one device at a range of up to 2,000 feet (a little over 600 meters). In theory, a mesh network would also get stronger and more robust with every bulb added, making for an appealingly scalable smart-home option.

Another highlight of the bulbs is their ability to change color temperature on demand. Whether it's a warm, incandescent-like 2,700K or a hot, bluish 6,000K that you're after, you'll be able to dial right in directly from the app.

Samsung calls this ""color tuning,"" and it's similar to what Philips is offering with its new  Hue Lux LEDs , which also change color temperatures. Other manufacturers seem to be interested in these sorts of white-light-only, color-changing smarts, too, since they provide an appealing middle ground between standard smart bulbs like the ones you'll find in the  Connected by TCP kit  and more expensive RGB color-changers, like  Lifx , the  Lumen LED , and  Philips Hue LEDs .

There's no word yet on the bulb's wattage or how many lumens it puts out, but Samsung claims it'll last 15,000 hours (about 13 years at the industry-standard rate of 3 hours a day). That would put it behind other LEDs and even other smart LEDs, where 25,000 hours is the more common standard.

We're also waiting on pricing info for Samsung's smart bulb, but given that the Hue Lux will sell for $40 a bulb, and that  LG's recently announced smart bulbs will sell for just above $30, I'd expect it to land somewhere in that range. (International pricing has yet to be announced, too, but these bulbs are expected to be available in countries beyond just the US.)"
Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor review:|"

The Swiss company Koubachi AG hopes to use its scientific prowess to craft new innovation for the smart home. It began by targeting plants and developing a free application to help you care for your household garden.  Now, they have a connected plant sensor to go along with the app.  You can purchase the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor as either an indoor unit or a hardier outdoor version for $99 or $129 (£80/AU$150), respectively.  Other than the price tag and some added rain resistance, both models are exactly the same.  They measure moisture, light, and temperature from the soil near your plant, and use that information along with the compiled knowledge of their Plant Care Engine to tell you exactly how to make your garden flourish.

Given that the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor measures almost as many categories of data as the  Parrot Flower Power  and boasts a range similar to  Oso Technologies' PlantLink , I had high hopes that it would be the perfect plant guardian.  It even has the most helpful database of the three, and since it's the most expensive, the high expectations felt warranted.  Unfortunately, lack of specificity when it comes to data, extremely slow recommendations, and a smaller upgrade from its free app than the price point should warrant keep the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor from reaching its full potential.  Patient gardeners looking for the most hands-off care on the market should consider the Koubachi.  However, there are plenty of cheaper options that require just a little more effort.  For instance, the PlantLink offers comparable monitoring for only $79, and Koubachi's own app, with just a little more time invested at setup, will freely offer care recommendations that are just as helpful as those you'd get by paying for the sensor.

The Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor requires no separate hub hardware to connect to your Wi-Fi network.  Both the indoor and the outdoor versions have a sleek, white head wrapped in a black stripe with a long gray tail.  A single black button dots the top of its dome.  Stick the tail in the soil by your plant and hold the button down to start the configuration.  A light above the button glows orange, signaling that it's ready, after which you can use Koubachi's iOS app or any Internet-enabled device to sync your sensor with any Wi-Fi router in range.  Koubachi has an Android app as well, but it can't help you configure your sensor yet.

You can purchase either version of the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor on Amazon or on Koubachi's website.  For an extra $30, the outdoor version buffs up its rain resistance, but both can stand a splash or two as you water your plants.

The online capabilities that go along with the physical device are quite user-friendly.  Koubachi uses pictures and step-by-step instructions to guide you through the initial process of getting your sensor to talk with your router.  The directions are simple and Koubachi makes them easy to follow.  The Koubachi database will even sense an error should something go wrong, and will walk you through troubleshooting automatically.  All told, to remove the sensor from the box, insert the two included AA batteries (which Koubachi claims will last for more than a year), and sync it with my Wi-Fi, I needed about 5 minutes.

Of course, you'll also need to tell Koubachi about the plant you're monitoring.  You can search Koubachi's database for a match in a number of ways.  On iOS apps, it has introduced a beta program called Plant Finder.  This fantastic guide walks you through identifying your plant one question at a time.  If you have no idea what kind of plant you're dealing with, this is the most user-friendly plant identification software I've come across.  Plant Finder will offer options about the shape of the leaves, the position of the stem, even the location of purchase, and you can pick from the provided pictures whenever you see a match or skip the question when you're stumped.  The database will use any responses you give it to make a guess at your plant type, and will show you pictures to help you decide if it has the right one.  If not, you can keep right on going through the questions.

Plant Finder is awesome.  Unfortunately, it's not yet available for the Android app.  You'll have to search this version of the app for the common or scientific name of your plant.  The website provides a little more guidance, as you have stem and leaf criteria to help you narrow the options if you want to scroll through pictures.

All versions of the database, even Android's, best the competition when it comes to how helpful they are at finding your plant.  However, Koubachi's number of plants to pick from comes in dead last by a wide margin compared with the databases of Parrot and Oso Technologies. Koubachi has around 800 plants to pick from, whereas Parrot and Oso have thousands.

With Plant Finder, Koubachi almost makes identifying your plant fun.  I felt like a detective, using questions and pictures as clues as I drew closer and closer to finding my suspect.  But if your plant is at all unusual, the database won't have it, and you'll be stuck with the letdown of an unsolved mystery.

Given Koubachi AG's pedigree, this lack of depth puzzles me. It has been developing the Plant Care Engine at the heart of its database since it launched its app more than three years ago.  The information it uses comes from the prestigious Swiss university, ETH Zurich.  Perhaps the amount of detail it gathers for each plant it adds slows its progress, but Parrot's database is just as detailed and much deeper.

If you don't find your plant, Koubachi will offer alternatives to pick from that have similar criteria, but you'll want to use an outside resource to make sure the care advice you're getting for this alternate plant is similar to what your actual plant needs.  Koubachi's price point is high, but its database is free, so your best bet is to check if it has your plant before you make your purchase.

To ease the cost, you can scale Koubachi's system by using the same sensor on multiple plants, but if you want live monitoring in multiple places, Koubachi lacks a way to cheaply add units.  The PlantLink, by Oso Technologies, makes scaling your system with additional Links easy.  Initially, at $79, it costs almost as much as Koubachi's $99 indoor version, since you have to purchase a Basestation to connect your Links.  However, you can purchase additional Links for $35 and add them to the same system.  Here, Koubachi's standalone nature works against it. Thus, if you want to monitor a variety of plants simultaneously, Koubachi's price necessitates that you look elsewhere.

The appearance of the device also sticks out more than the competitors.  Parrot's aesthetic is the most appealing.  Its branchlike shape can fit into almost any garden decor.  PlantLink's small, white sensor is easy to hide.  The Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor looks like a one-eyed robot.  It's distracting, and because it needs to be placed outside of the shade of the branches of your plant so it can accurately judge light conditions, the Koubachi sensor is impossible to hide.  Make sure you take a close look at the pictures before you make your purchase.  If you decide on the Koubachi, every time you look at your plant, you'll see this cyclops of a sensor looking back.

Once the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor is keeping its watchful eye on your garden, it will begin gathering information on soil moisture, ambient temperature, and ambient light.  It sends that information to the cloud, where Koubachi's Plant Care Engine interprets the readings and gives you advice to best care for your specific plant.

The recommendations are specific without being precise.  After Koubachi's cloud processes the readings from your sensor, you'll be told you need to water your plant, or that your plant has enough water.  You might be told to find a sunnier spot or a warmer spot for it.  The Plant Care Engine will even give you advice about fertilizer and misting, simply based on its knowledge of your plant.

Koubachi will also tell you exactly how to water, in great detail.  For my plant, I needed to use room temperature water and add enough so that it dripped through to the saucer.  After 15 minutes, I removed the excess from the saucer.  I found Koubachi's recommendations to be the easiest to follow of the smart sensors I've tested.

However, the sensor doesn't provide precise data.  It won't tell you how much sunlight or water your plant needs.  That said, nothing on the market will, and Koubachi gives you enough information so that you can easily figure it out.  The watering recommendations give a fairly good idea of how much to water and when to stop.

For sunlight and temperature, you can compare the advice to the information on your plant in Koubachi's database.  The sensor told me my cactus had too much shade.  I could see on the graph that over the course of the week, my cactus only had partial shade during the sunniest times of the day.  Unfortunately, the graph itself won't show the ideal range by comparison, but at least it uses the same language as the database.  Since the database revealed that my cactus preferred full sunlight, I was able to figure out exactly what ""a sunnier spot"" meant for my plant.  Knowing your plant's preferences as far as temperature range and sunlight makes it easy to use the recommendations and the collected information to figure out exactly what you need to do to care for your plant.

You can also see live data by pressing the button on the sensor.  This handy feature lets you see immediate readings for moisture, sunlight, and temperature.  Thus, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor does take exact measurements, so I'm not sure why it doesn't let you see them on the long-term charts as well.

If you're studying the conditions of your garden over time, you'll want to look elsewhere.  Koubachi's storage is only temporary, you can't see exact points on the collected data graphs, they don't show up on the apps, and there's no way to download them and collect the data yourself.

Koubachi has promised this increased precision in its upcoming ""pro"" version. Given that the Parrot Flower Power already tracks and stores data well, Koubachi has some catching up to do, and no price info is available yet for this upgraded model.

Though it's not the device for dataphiles or citizen scientists, Koubachi's easy-to-understand recommendations across all important plant care categories make it a great all-in-one garden guardian for those who need help keeping their plants alive long-term.

Again, it tracks moisture, sunlight, and temperature, and makes recommendations for each of those as well as fertilizer and misting.  Additionally, a single sensor can give advice for multiple plants.  Leave it with a plant long enough, and it will learn the moisture cycle and continue giving you advice after you've moved your sensor to another spot.  In this way, it is possible to cheaply scale the Koubachi system, but it takes a while.

In fact, just about everything with Koubachi takes a while; even the live readings are slow to react to spikes.  For instance, when I watered my plant or put it in the fridge to shift the temperature, the sensor would take hours to fully update to the new conditions.

The recommendations, though thorough and helpful, take even longer.  You'll have to wait a day for watering recommendations, three days for temperature recommendations, and seven for lighting recommendations.  This pace might be deliberate, but it still requires patience to operate.  That said, by the time it bestows its advice, it understands the cycles of your plant's environment better than any other plant sensor out there.

Therefore, if you want the Koubachi to help you plan the watering cycle of several household plants, plan for it to take weeks for each one.  It needs to process a full watering cycle before it'll remember enough to give you advice about when to water in the future.  Thus, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor functions more like a wise old sage than a nimble and reactive protector.

Once it knows, though, it can send you fully customizable reminders and alerts.  I let one of my plants dry out, and sure enough, the email came through, reminding me that I needed to water the bamboo I affectionately named ""Planty.""  The emails are cut and dried, but they serve the purpose, and as I continued to let the pot dry out, they kept coming.  They arrived daily until I watered Planty, counting up with each passing day to politely add a level of urgency to the task as the number grew.

The slowness of the readings meant I still received a reminder email a few hours after I watered my plant, so you'll need to be careful with communication if you have multiple people responsible for taking care of your garden.  The sensor's lack of responsiveness will make it easy to get wires crossed, but you can help avoid confusion by simply telling the system after you've given your plant water.

Of course, once you've placed the sensor elsewhere, you'll need to tell the database when you've watered the plants not currently being monitored so it can stay up to date on the moisture cycle, and as long as you do that, you'll keep getting accurate reminder emails from unmonitored plants as well.

In fact, with just a little extra effort, you can get moisture, fertilizer, and misting recommendations without the sensor at all.  The fertilizer and misting recommendations are automatic.  To add moisture recommendations for an unmonitored plant, you'll go through the same process of telling the application about your plant, naming it, and telling it the location.  Then, you'll water it, and follow the system's instructions for checking on the soil moisture daily.  Each day during this initial calibration, you'll report back on whether the soil has dried out yet.  Once it does, Koubachi will remember that time frame and will send you reminders to help keep that unmonitored plant alive as well.

Koubachi's ability to help with unmonitored plants puts the usefulness of its app well ahead of the competition.  The information it keeps on the plants in its database is specific and helpful.  It's easy to understand which plants will survive best in the conditions of your home just from looking through the available choices and what helps them flourish.  You can view all of your plants, monitored or not, from a single, aesthetically pleasing screen, where you can check on the recommendations for each.

The Koubachi system takes awhile to get up and running, but once it does, this day to day functionality is fantastic.  The Plant Care Engine and the app it runs is so good, actually, that it calls into question the need for the device at all.

Again, the free app comes with all of Koubachi's Plant Care Engine information.  The Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor costs $129 for the outdoor version and $99 for the less water-resistant indoor version.  Since it doesn't track long-term data that well, the sensor is only useful as a plant guardian.  Without the sensor, the app will tell you about fertilizer and misting, and you can configure moisture recommendations yourself.  The sensor monitors moisture for you, and adds temperature and light readings.

However, you'll need to compare the temperature and light readings to the database anyway to make sure you're correctly following the recommendations, and the database will tell you the temperature range and sunlight preferences of your plant, with or without the sensor.  Thus, by calibrating the moisture and checking the sunlight and temperature yourself, you can use Koubachi's free app to figure out all of the recommendations offered by the $129 sensor.

Not to mention, if you're monitoring an outdoor space, you might not be able to control the temperature or ambient light.  Meaning, the two primary functions added by the sensor will be giving you recommendations for things beyond your control.

Again, if you want to be hands-off with your plant care and are willing to pay for that privilege, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor is a great garden guardian.  However, there are many options out there that can monitor your plants as effectively in exchange for a little extra effort on your part, and one of those options is Koubachi's own Web-based application.

Fortunately, in our performance tests, Koubachi's sensor proved accurate enough to be helpful.  Again, this is not a precise collector of data, and its readings reflect that, but it always stays within a close enough margin of error so it can make viable recommendations to keep your plants alive.

To test the accuracy of the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor, we placed it in a pot with a ponytail palm and compared its readings over the course of a month with those of a separate, calibrated meter.

Here are the results:

Across all categories, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor was obviously detecting the same spikes and dips as our calibrated meter. Part of the reason it lacks precision is due to the way it measures. For instance, most moisture meters check the percent of soil moisture with 0 percent indicating dry and 100 percent indicating completely saturated. Koubachi measures on a plant-by-plant scale. 0 percent is still dry, but 100 percent indicates your plant has all of the water it needs. It's a smaller scale, since your plant will inevitably register Koubachi's 100 percent rating sooner than complete saturation. We converted the units for the sake of the comparison, but Koubachi's broad-stroke approach still left it lacking in accuracy. As a result, in tests comparing this measurement to the other plant sensors we've tested, Koubachi performs the worst.

However, Koubachi does it this way to increase the helpfulness of its recommendations. Instead of looking at an independent percentage, it's showing you exactly how close you are to your plant's sweet spot. Its dedication to being user-friendly does cost its accuracy. The range it's working with is smaller, so it's going to be less precise, but it does stay within a reasonable margin of error for keeping your plant alive.  Thus, Koubachi's performance maintains its status as a lousy data collector and a fine garden advisor.

If you're interested in bringing Smart Home connectivity to the garden, Koubachi AG can help you do it.  For $129 and $99 for the respective outdoor and indoor varieties, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor is the most expensive and most comprehensive device you can use to give your plant a voice.  Though the database this sensor connects to is limited in number of plants, if it has yours, you can expect to be guided through the most thorough and helpful online experience available as well.  Whether you want to check on your plants with your computer, your Android device, or your iOS device, Koubachi has you covered.

That said, if you're interested in rescuing a plant or collecting data, the  Parrot Flower Power  is faster, cheaper, and more precise.  If you simply need to monitor moisture levels and want a long range and easily scalable system to help you do that, go with  Oso Technologies' PlantLink .  Nevertheless, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor has a longer range than Parrot, and advises on everything, unlike PlantLink.  Thus, if you want the most hands-off and comprehensive device and are willing to pay for it, consider the Koubachi.  To help make your decision, start off with their free application.  That'll do most of the work for you anyway, and if you like it, but wish the process was a little more automated, the sensor might be worth your while."
Netatmo Urban Weather Station review:|"

The $180 Netatmo Weather Station wants to take armchair meteorology to a whole new level. Its two modules are capable of monitoring things like temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and even noise levels both inside and outside of the home. A Wi-Fi connection means that you'll be able to monitor all of it on your phone, tablet, or computer. Throw in the  full-scale integration with the popular online automation service IFTTT, and the fact that Netatmo was recently included during the announcement of Apple's HomeKit smart home platform, and you're suddenly looking at one of the most well-connected weather trackers available to consumers.

If you're a hardcore hobbyist or a longtime weather geek, I've probably got your attention, but if not, I might have lost you at ""armchair meteorology."" That's kind of the problem here, as the average consumer is likely content with any of the numerous free weather apps they probably already have. If you live in a rural area, where location-specific weather information can be hard to come by, or if you need to monitor the conditions in something specific, like a wine cellar a greenhouse, or maybe a second home, I think the Netatmo makes sense. Otherwise, you'd probably need to consider yourself one of those full-fledged weather geeks in order to justify spending this much money.

Each Netatmo module is a rather sparse-looking aluminum cylinder that's packed with sensors. The indoor module is the taller of the two at 6 inches high (155mm), while the outdoor module comes in at 4 inches (105mm). You won't find any dials, buttons, or display screens on either of them, although you do have the option of tapping the top of the indoor module to force it to take a reading.

You will find a Micro-USB port on the back of the indoor module, which is how you'll keep the thing powered. The outdoor module runs on two AAA batteries (included), which Netatmo claims will keep things powered for a year.

To get your system up and running, you'll plug in the indoor module and pop the batteries into the outdoor module, then log onto Netatmo's servers. I did this by downloading the Netatmo app (available on most recent iOS and Android devices), but you can use the Netatmo website, too.

Like most of the smart home gadgets I've tested out, the Netatmo app does a good job of walking you through the setup process with clear, step-by-step instructions. With Netatmo, the system simply asks if it can copy your phone's Wi-Fi settings, so you won't even need to pick a network or punch in a password.

Once you do, that vertical slit on the indoor module will glow green to let you know that everything's synced up. That's a nice little feature -- but I never caught the module lighting up again throughout all of my testing, which seems like a bit of a waste of a perfectly good LED. I would have enjoyed the option to customize that light a bit, and perhaps set it to glow if certain criteria were met, like if the CO2 level was rising too high. A helpful feature like that would alert you to take action and open some windows without ever needing to pull your phone out of your pocket.

At any rate, within a minute or two of starting the setup process, I was up and running and ready to start tracking the local climate. What this really means is that I suddenly found myself staring at a melange of information on my phone, wondering ""what now?"" The Netatmo app told me the temperature and humidity, that there was 370 parts per million (ppm) worth of CO2 circulating around the office air, and also that the noise levels were a quiet 52 decibels. It did not, however, tell me what I was supposed to do with this information.

Things became clearer as time went on. Turn your phone into the horizontal position, and the app will switch over into a graph mode, where you can track how things have changed over time. That's a feature I found myself wishing for as I reviewed the  Quirky Spotter , which also tracks environmental changes, but which lacks graphs or timelines of any kind.

With Netatmo, I finally got to see what I had been missing with the Spotter. The graphs are easy to navigate with swipe and pinch gestures, and surprisingly fun to examine. Looking at the noise levels for instance, I could discern the point at which I had left at the end of the day, and the point at which the evening cleaning crew had arrived. I don't know why that seemed neat to me, but it did.

The Netatmo app also offers full 7-day forecasts provided by MeteoGroup, a private weather tracking service based in Europe. Aside from the basic day-by-day summary, you can look at the specific temperature projections and even estimated rainfall amounts. True, this is stuff that you can get for free from other apps, but it makes sense for Netatmo to include it in theirs.

Still, the huge amount of data makes for a slightly cluttered presentation on smart phone screens, especially the iPhone. Unlike the tablet version of the app, the smart phone version can't fit the information for both the indoor and outdoor module on one screen, so you'll need to swipe up and down to change between them. On my iPhone, I often found myself swiping up from the bottom to pull up my indoor module's screen, and pulling up the iOS Control Center instead.

Overall, Netatmo impressed me with its performance. The indoor module's temperature readings always stayed right in line with our office thermostat. The noise sensor seemed accurate too, and was able to differentiate between loud, quiet, and silent.

Netatmo factors this noise data into an overall comfort score. I'm not sure how useful or scientific it actually is, but I suppose it'd be nice to have the numbers back you up when telling a roommate to turn his TV down at night.

The outdoor sensor is water-resistant, which is something Netatmo claims to have have improved upon from the product's original design. I tested this out by spraying the module with a little bit of makeshift condensation -- the readings didn't seem to be affected, and the module continued working just fine.

I wanted to be sure and play around with the Netatmo's IFTTT channel, too. Right off the bat, I was impressed with the fact that you're able to use fourteen different measurements as recipe triggers. Temperature, humidity, CO2, noise, air pressure, rainfall... if Netatmo can monitor it, IFTTT can trigger a recipe with it.

That puts Netatmo well ahead of the Quirky Spotter, which, despite having multiple sensors, currently only offers two IFTTT trigger options: one for when the temperature gets too hot, and another for when the temperature gets too cold.

The Netatmo's 14 triggers get especially interesting once you start thinking about the wide range of services and devices that IFTTT brings to the table. With IFTTT, I could sync the Netatmo up with something like a  WeMo Switch , for instance, and automatically turn a fan or air conditioner on whenever things got too hot.

To put the Netatmo triggers to the test, I decided to track the temperature at CNET Appliances HQ. From my previous day of testing, I knew that the overnight office temperature would drop to 70 degrees Farenheit (20 degrees Celsius), then warm back up to 73 degrees F or 74 degrees F (about 22 to 23 C) the next morning. So, I crafted an IFTTT recipe that would alert me of that change. If my indoor module recorded a temperature above 72 degrees F (about 22 C), then IFTTT would kick in and send me an iOS notification alerting me to the fact.

That's a pretty subtle temperature increase, and I was worried that Netatmo might be slow to catch it, or that IFTTT would fail to report the change. Fortunately, just a minute or so after recording a temperature of 72.1 degrees Farenheit (22.3 degrees Celsius) , my phone buzzed with the alert. The Netatmo and IFTTT had passed the test with flying colors, and did so again and again as I repeated the test.

The results were reassuring, and they help to justify the fact that Netatmo essentially outsourced notification duties to IFTTT. Still, some users might find it frustrating that they need to download a second app in order to set and receive those sorts of custom alerts.

Netatmo will, however, automatically send you alerts in the case of a ""Special Weather Event."" During the time I spent testing the system out, we had a storm system pass through Louisville that brought a tornado watch with it. Sure enough, Netamo let me know about it, and let me know when it had ended, too.

I can't say that the Netatmo Weather Station has made me any more of a weather geek, but if I were one, I think that I'd be pretty happy with it. Setting it up was a cinch, and it proved to be an accurate, reliable performer in all of my tests. I'd feel comfortable trusting it to keep tabs on a greenhouse or a wine cellar. Plus, IFTTT integration opens up a whole range of new possibilities -- for instance, automatically sending that aforementioned roommate a text telling him to turn the TV down.

Still, if all you want is an app that'll help you keep a casual eye on the local skies, you don't need to spend $179. You probably don't need to spend anything, not even for IFTTT integration (the Yahoo! Weather IFTTT channel works for basic purposes, and doesn't cost a dime). There's a lot to like about Netatmo, but unless you're more of a weather geek than I am, you're probably better off saving that money for something that isn't such a niche product."
D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug review:|"

The $50 D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug is a decent option if you're interested in basic home automation. Pair the plug with a lamp or other small appliance and use D-Link's free Android or iOS app to turn it on and off, set custom schedules, and monitor its energy usage. It's very similar to the $60  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch  and the $50  Belkin WeMo Switch , except for one key difference: D-Link's version isn't compatible with IFTTT.

On the performance side, D-Link's Wi-Fi Smart Plug and app were both periodically glitchy during testing. While D-Link's Wi-Fi Smart Plug is OK at performing its functions, it doesn't seem like it can compete with the thoughtful dependability of Belkin's WeMo switches.  I'd stick with Belkin even if IFTTT compatibility isn't on the top of your connected-home wish list.

This white, single-outlet plug measures 3.5 inches tall by 2.4 inches  wide by 1.4 inches deep. It weighs 4.4 ounces and has a rectangular  shape with rounded-off edges. It's rated for 100 to 125 volts of  alternating current (VAC). That means that the outlet should be used to  power lamps or other small appliances (large appliances have higher VAC  requirements).

The Mydlink Smart Plug app  works with Android 4.0 or higher and iOS 6 or higher on  tablets and  smartphones, and on Wi-Fi and cellular connections. It operates on a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi frequency and  you can control  up to 10 different Wi-Fi Smart Plugs at the same time  using the app.



The $50 D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug fits into any three-prong electrical outlet on a wall or a power strip. Like a standard outlet, D-Link's plug is more functional than it is aesthetically compelling -- it probably won't be winning design awards anytime soon. It does blend into a two-outlet wall unit fairly seamlessly, and I'm guessing that was the intention.

But just when I was about to blame the blandness of traditional outlets  for the blandness of this smart outlet, I started thinking about  Dyson's vacuum cleaners and  Nest's thermostats . Both companies have  managed to make household objects into design statements rather than  something you try to hide in a dark corner. They weren't satisfied with  the uninspired design that dominates their appliance categories, so why should D-Link's plug look so plain?

D-Link isn't alone, though. Its Wi-Fi Smart Plug  is similar in style to the $50  Belkin WeMo Switch , the $60  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch , and the $49  SAM plug . Still, Belkin definitely improved on its plug design between the WeMo Switch and its more recently introduced Insight Switch, so I'm not quite ready to let D-Link off the hook.

D-Link's Wi-Fi Smart Plug has a power on/off button with LED indicator underneath that lights up green when your connected appliance is on. There's also a status LED that will glow red when it's powering on, trying to reset, or broken. It will blink orange during its initial setup or if it isn't correctly connected to the Wi-Fi network. It will blink green when the Wi-Fi is connecting and it will display solid green when it's successfully connected.

You can press the power button manually on the switch if you want to power your connected device directly. There's also a Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) button. Pressing it and the WPS button on your router, if your router has one, will initiate a connection between the plug and the router. If your router doesn't have a WPS button, there's another set of steps you can follow during setup, but you might end up using the Smart Plug's WPS button anyway; pressing and holding the WPS button until the LED status light turns red will reset your plug to factory settings.

Early setup is about as simple as possible. Find a three-prong outlet that's in a convenient spot for the gadget you want to operate and plug in the Smart Plug. Then, download the app and follow the steps -- this is where things got more complicated.

I had a really hard time actually finding the Mydlink Smart Plug app in  both the iOS and Android app stores. In the Google Play store it's called Mydlink WiFi Smart Plug and in iTunes it's called Smart Plug.

Once I found and downloaded both apps, setup got easier, but there were still a couple of confusing parts. For example, the setup menu  gives you the option of a WPS setup or a manual setup. If you have a  router with WPS, then this is fairly straightforward. If you don't, you have  to go the manual setup route. That's the option I chose and you have to  use a six-digit pin code located on a small card that's included in the box  (it's also on the back of your plug, but that's plugged in at this point,  so that's no help). After I entered the code, I selected the office Wi-Fi network and it connected.

After setup, I plugged a nearby lamp into the Wi-Fi Smart Plug and was able to control it via the app. I created schedules, checked the lamp's wattage, and monitored its temperature readings from both Wi-Fi and cellular connections on my  iPhone 5  and a  Motorola Droid Maxx .

Things were going well, but then I ran into a curious problem while using the iOS app. You're supposed to be able to receive reminders based on the schedules you set. However, the enable button for this function was grayed out and I couldn't slide it over to ""on."" I didn't have the same problem in the Android app.

The biggest issue I encountered, though, happened when I unplugged the Smart Plug. Even if it had only been disconnected for a few minutes, it didn't always remember the product I had just successfully set up. This happened often enough that I kept the small card with my six-digit code handy, knowing that I would have to start the setup process all over again.

Now, a lot of you will probably pick the  product you want to control and leave it plugged in. Just be aware that if you did  decide to remove it temporarily (no matter how briefly), the app might not reflect all those steps you completed earlier. I have three different  Belkin WeMo products set up in my WeMo app and at various times certain ones are plugged in and connected and others aren't. Still, every time I reconnect them, they always dutifully reappear in the list of products as if they had been there all along.

While I was initially intrigued by a device that costs the same as Belkin's standard WeMo Switch, but offers energy usage information similar to Belkin's more expensive $60 WeMo Insight Switch, D-Link's Wi-Fi Smart Plug disappointed at almost every turn. Simply put, it has too many inconsistencies to recommend. Consider one of the Belkin smart switches if you want something that actually remembers the products you set up and has the added bonus of IFTTT compatibility."
Don't let the name fool you -- this is one classy fan|"

The name might be funny, but Lexington, Ky.-based manufacturer Big Ass Fans wants to be a serious smart home contender, with a connected ceiling fan that claims first-of-its-kind features.

The product is the Haiku Ceiling Fan with SenseMe, and it features built-in Wi-Fi, motion detection, and sensors for things like heat and humidity. Using a free smartphone app, you'll be able to control and schedule the Haiku to your heart's content, or just set it to learn what temperatures you like, then cool accordingly all on its own. Those are all great features -- but they won't come close to cheap. The Haiku with SenseMe rings in at a head-spinning $1,045 (international pricing and availability won't be released until early 2015, but currently that converts to £620, or AU$1,120).

That's obviously an awful lot to pay for a smart ceiling fan -- enough to make $250 (or £250)  Nest Learning Thermostat  and $300  Quirky+GE Aros Smart Air Conditioner  (US-only), both of which offer similar smart climate control features, seem like absolute steals by comparison.

Still, the price point has less to do with smarts than it does with the specific ceiling fan we're talking about. The first generation of the Haiku (sans smarts) made its debut in 2012, and was the first residential appliance produced by Big Ass Fans, who until then, had specialized primarily in eponymous large-sized industrial fans.

Marketed as an ultra-high-end ceiling fan, each $895 Haiku boasts top of the line energy efficiency (up to four times more efficient than Energy Star requires), is individually hand-balanced for wobble-free performance, includes a handy remote, runs whisper quiet, and comes crafted from materials like glossy, glass-infused matrix composite or sustainable Moso bamboo.

Big Ass Fans claims that the lightweight, compressed bamboo they use is as strong as steel. The engineering team behind the Haiku was so so confident in this claim during our site visit that they invited our own Colin West McDonald to slam one of their airfoils against the corner of a thick table to try and damage it. Despite giving it all he's got, McDonald couldn't even make a dent in the thing. Chalk a big one up for the Haiku's build quality.

In reality, the new Haiku is just that same, old, ooh-and-ahh-worthy Haiku from 2012 with the SenseMe smarts added in for an extra $150. If you're already committed to splurging on a Haiku, spending an additional $150 for a full suite of connected smarts actually seems reasonable.

Those smarts include the aforementioned motion- and temperature-sensing capabilities, along with the kind of learning capability that allows the Haiku to adapt to your cooling needs over time -- similar to what the Nest offers.

Like a smart thermostat system such as the Nest, the Haiku knows how to respond to temperature changes in your home. Aside from monitoring the temperature levels at the ceiling, it uses laser-based infrared sensors to monitor the temperature at floor level, too. This gives it an accurate overall sense of the climate situation in a given room (the engineers at Big Ass Fans call them ""microenvironments"").

From there, the Haiku will do its best to keep temperatures where you want them. If things get too hot, it'll automatically start spinning its airfoils faster. If you leave it on overnight, it'll recognize when the temperature drops and turn off automatically -- which means you won't have to worry about waking up with the shivers.

There's also the option of integrating an 800-lumen LED light into the fan for an additional $95. For those keeping score, that would bring the total price up to $1,140, and would bring some added smart features into the picture. For instance, you could schedule that light to turn on randomly while you're away on vacation to simulate occupancy, or to slowly fade on in the morning to help make 6 a.m. less unbearable. The Haiku with SenseMe is also capable of waking you up using its built-in alarm, or by simply spinning the blades at a gradually increasing intensity.

Another unique feature that I'm a fan of is called ""Whoosh."" Turn it on, and the Haiku will begin randomly adjusting its speed using smooth, subtle gradients in order to simulate a pleasant, ever-changing breeze. That's a nice, creative touch, as far as features go, and one that gives the impression that the team at Big Ass Fans put a lot of thought into making this product as worthwhile as possible.

All of the smart features are packed into the Haiku's iOS app, which I got the chance to play with in the Big Ass Fans lab. I came away impressed with the intuitive, easy-to-use controls, and with how responsive things seemed. I also liked the sheer scope of control you get over the Haiku -- from the fan to the light to the beeps to the blue LEDs that shine in the center to indicate speed, you're able to customize all of it to your exact liking, making for smarts at their most luxurious.

Of course, this will mean little to Android users, as the Android version of Haiku's app won't be ready for the product's launch, currently scheduled for the end of July. The team at Big Ass Fans tells me that the Android app is still 6 to 12 months from completion -- though they also insist that it's closer to six. I can just hear a collective ""Gee, thanks"" from Android users now, and I can't say that I blame them.

The very idea of a connected ceiling fan seems obvious in hindsight -- after all, Aros was an instant best-seller on Amazon when it debuted this spring, and Google figured Nest's value at  just north of $3 billion. The demand for smart climate control is clearly there, so sure, why not add smart ceiling fans into the mix? As the first one out there, the Haiku with SenseMe merits attention -- and as the ones to build it, Big Ass Fans deserves credit.

Still, that price point bucks the trend of an increasingly accessible smart home. At $1,045, this particular smart fan won't ever be a mainstream hit, but instead, a high-end status symbol for upper-crust ceilings. There's nothing wrong with that, but I know that I'll likely be waiting for Big Ass Fans to pack that SenseMe technology into a more affordable model -- or, for the competition to take notice and do the job for them."
Cree brings three-way LEDs center stage (hands-on)|"

When Apple unveiled HomeKit for iOS 8 at WWDC 2014 earlier this week, Cree was among a handful of companies already compatible with the smart home, Siri-integrated platform. Now, Cree is generating even more buzz with today's announcement of a three-way 30W, 60W, and 100W replacement LED bulb.

This new bulb is available for $25 (£15, AU$27) at Home Depot online and in stores in the US, but UK and Australian availability have yet to be announced.

This is a pretty big deal for the LED industry. A quick online search will tell you that there aren't a ton of three-way LED bulbs available. That's especially true among big-name manufacturers, but Cree is making a clear effort to bring more versatility to its lineup. I wouldn't mind being able to transition from accent to reading light without needing to move to a different lamp with a different bulb.

While this specific bulb is new territory for Cree, it does share similarities with the brand's more basic LEDs.  It retains the same 2,700K color temperature, 25,000-hour lifespan, and 10-year warranty as Cree's single  60W  and  100W replacement LEDs . Not only that, but I couldn't tell a big difference between the three-way bulb's ""60W"" 820 lumens and the regular ""60W"" LED's 800 lumens. The same goes for the three-way bulb's ""100W"" 1,620 lumens and the regular ""100W"" LED's 1,600 lumens.

Upon closer inspection, you can see some subtle differences, but the main takeaway is that the three-way 60W and 100W replacement settings aren't dramatically different from what we observed in Cree's standard 60W and 100W bulbs. Of course, we'll have a more detailed analysis of the specs in the upcoming review, complete with spectrometer readings and all other sorts of LED bulb goodness."
Parrot Flower Power review:|"

Parrot, the maker of the  AR Drone and a multitude of hands-free  communication devices for cars , brings its connectivity prowess to the world of plants with the $60 Parrot Flower Power.  A standalone sensor, Flower Power is battery-operated and Bluetooth-enabled.  You place it in the soil next to your plant, pick your plant from the Parrot plant database, and it will diagnose any issues and help you monitor your plant's needs for long-term care.  Flower Power monitors and collects data on soil moisture, sunlight, temperature, and fertilizer.  With all of that capability in tow, Flower Power hopes to be the all-purpose garden guardian.

As a plant rescuer, Parrot's product works well, if a bit slowly.  If you have a plant that's suffering and you're having trouble figuring out why, Parrot can help.  However, as a plant monitor, Parrot's offering doesn't stack up to the competition.  Oso Technologies' PlantLink  is faster and monitors moisture levels more efficiently, and Koubachi monitors the same conditions as the Flower Power and offers better connectivity for long-term care. I can't broadly recommend the Flower Power, since most consumers will find a better fit for their garden care  elsewhere.





Available on Amazon, the Apple Store online, and on Parrot's website, the Flower Power is an unobtrusive, twig-shaped sensor available in blue, green, or brown. You insert the included AAA battery into the short stem.  Put the cap on to hold it in place and the light on the long stem will blink as it looks to establish a connection.

Insert Flower Power into the soil next to your plant and and it will collect and store data on moisture levels, sunlight, temperature, and even fertilizer.  It communicates that information to your phone or tablet via Bluetooth Low Energy.  You'll need to have the app installed to receive the data, and currently the app is only available on iOS, though Parrot has promised an Android version soon.  Your phone or tablet will also need to be compatible with Bluetooth LE, meaning you'll need at least the iPhone 4S, the iPad 3, or a fifth-generation iPod touch.

You'll finish the setup by connecting the Flower Power with Parrot's free app.  Through the app, you'll tell Parrot about the plant you're monitoring, identifying the type of plant via the extensive plant database, then filling in the location and a nickname.  Flower Power works both indoors and outdoors, and can use the GPS of your connected device to find the exact location of your plant.

The initial setup is quick, but you'll need to wait 24 to 48 hours for Flower Power to read the conditions before it can make its first plant-specific recommendations.  It does have a Live Mode which you can use to see data immediately for moisture, light, and temperature (fertilizer doesn't work with this mode), but you'll need to be patient for it to start interpreting what you're seeing.

After the initial adjustment, Flower Power will chart data over time, and make recommendations on all four categories that it tracks.  For instance, it might tell you that your plant doesn't have enough water or sunlight, but has plenty of fertilizer and is in comfortable temperature conditions. The app will then add anything you need to change to a convenient To Do list.  Once you check things off, it'll read the new conditions and give you an updated recommendation 24 hours later.

Additionally, Flower Power gathers and stores all of the data between check-ins.  Once you're up and running, you can move within range of the plant and pull up the app.  The Flower Power will use your app to update the cloud-based database with all of the new information it gathered since you were last in range, and you'll then be able to see all four categories graphed over time on both your phone and on any internet capable device.  Give it a couple of weeks, and it'll even start to make long-term recommendations about when you need to water and fertilize, and it'll update your To Do list on both your phone and browser with that information as well.

If you have a passion for gardening, and have run into a situation where a plant keeps wilting despite your best efforts and you're stumped, the Flower Power can come to your rescue thanks to its recommendation function.

The specific data will also be useful if you're a budding citizen scientist looking to study the conditions of your garden.  Unfortunately, anyone simply looking to add convenience to plant care will be disappointed by the Parrot Flower Power.

To start, the Flower Power doesn't add that much convenience.  The PlantLink, by Oso Technologies, uses a Zigbee radio signal to consistently send updates about your plant's moisture to the cloud, without any additional effort on your part.  The Koubachi Wi-Fi Sensor functions similarly, and can communicate directly with the cloud as long as it's in range of your router.  For the Parrot to get any info, you need to be within Bluetooth range of your sensor and update the information manually.

If, like me, you tend to kill plants with accidental negligence, this lack of automation will result in just as many garden-based fatalities; I won't be any more likely to remember to check on my plant with my phone in hand, than I would be to water it.

You'll also need to go back and forth from the app to your browser to get all of the information you want.  You can manage and add plants, and also get updates via the app.  However, the browser is the only way to check specific data points.  You can see charts on the app, but if you want to know a specific moisture percentage at a specific time, the full Web page is the only way to do it.

This strange disconnect carries over to the recommendations as well.  Parrot has a great plant database.  It's the most functional that I've tested.  It only has 6,000 entries compared to the 50,000 PlantLink boasts, but that 6,000 feels much more useful.  The search software works well, and the accompanying pictures and information make it easy to not only find your plant but to learn about it.  All of that information comes from Parrot's research in conjunction with Dutch university Wageningen UR, and is used to make those recommendations on how to care for your plant.

Yet it keeps you in the dark about how it arrives at its recommendations, or how the data from your plant compares to the ideals it needs.  Without this specificity, you're left to guess what exactly ""Water Your Plant"" means.  How much water should you give it?  The charts will tell you how much moisture it has in terms of a percent -- 0 percent is completely dry, 100 percent is soaking wet -- but the chart won't show you how much moisture your plant likes. The database will give you this info in broader terms, but how does the fact that your plant likes two drops (out of a possible five) translate to soil moisture percentage?  Parrot never helps you take that leap.  The database must talk to the data to create the recommendations it gives you, but you're certainly not privy to the conversation.

Live Mode would be a great way to make sure you're giving your plant exactly the right amount of water or sun.  It's a feature of the app that shows a moving graph with current conditions, and it's quite cool to watch the soil moisture increase instantly as you pour more and more water into the soil by your plant.  Again, though, without knowing what percentage to aim for, this feature is much less useful than it could be.

Your To Do list, though handy and simple, won't even automatically update after you've completed a task. Live Mode is clearly picking up the extra water you're giving your plant, but ""water"" remains on your list unchecked.  You'll have to mark it completed yourself, and only then will the Flower Power get back to work and check on updated recommendations.

These, like the initial recommendations, will take about 24 hours to populate.  This is much slower than the turnaround for PlantLink, and you'll need to head back out to your plant and get in Bluetooth range to get the update.  Occasionally, the initial time window had passed, I checked on the plant, and it still needed a couple more hours.  Walking back inside and back out again after another waiting period probably brought me some much needed exercise, but I wouldn't call it a convenience.

From the extensive and informative plant database to the very specific charts it compiles, to the number of facets it measures and the Live Mode, Flower Power is loaded with features.  But because those features don't talk to each other in any kind of understandable fashion, many of them are  much less useful than they could be.

Flower Power is even compatible with  IFTTT , a website which allows you to connect  smart devices to the Internet of Things and even have them communicate with each other.  For Flower Power, this means you can establish triggers for any of the four parameters measured by the device, and IFTTT can send you push notifications or alerts.  The possibilities of  IFTTT compatibility are nearly infinite.  For example, you can teach IFTTT to turn your lights on or off if the light level alert for your plant triggers.  You'd need the light to be attached to another smart device like a  WeMo Switch  or a  SmartThings hub , but it's possible.

Unfortunately, like the rest of Flower Power's features, this IFTTT compatibility ends up being much cooler in theory than in practice because of its Bluetooth-restricted connectivity. To get an alert based on current readings from your plant, you'll need to be close to your plant with the app open.  It'll update, and you'll see the most current charts on the app you have open anyway so it can do so.  Then, you'll get your push notification...with info you just saw.

Once, I received a text after the 24-hour waiting period for recommendations.  It told me my plant needed more light.  This was the first time Flower Power showed me its potential as a connected device.  I was getting an alert based on newly processed information I had gathered yesterday; the IFTTT compatibility meant something!  However, even this was based on day-old information, and I still had to go to the plant to get the updated readings and see the status of the other parameters. This was the only alert I ever received that wasn't in immediate proximity to checking my plant.  I did everything I could to cross the alert thresholds in the other categories -- I let the pot dry out for days, I drenched it, I put it in the fridge -- and nothing else ever came.

All told, Flower Power's limited and inconsistent communication features means it is an unreliable garden sentinel.  It knows when there is trouble, but it has no way to reach out and tell you.  It gives your plant a voice, but limits that voice to a whisper.

Thankfully that whisper is accurate.  The Parrot Flower Power doesn't function well as a connected plant sensor, but it's adequate as a diligent gatherer of data.

We placed the Flower Power in a pot with a ponytail palm and checked its readings over the course of a month against those from a separate calibrated meter.  Parrot's measurements for soil moisture, ambient temperature, and ambient light were all within the expected margin of error.

For soil moisture, ambient temperature, and ambient light, the Parrot Flower Power does a great job of reliably collecting data. Its measurements for fertilizer disappoint.

Parrot's device nailed the soil moisture test.  Similar to PlantLink's performance, it started out with a small variance that decreased over the course of the month.  The small variance is to be expected at first, since the Flower Power and calibrated meter weren't in the exact same spot and the soil was porous.  The fact that the reading grew closer and closer to the one from the VG-200 over time, as the soil settled, is a great sign, and on par with PlantLink.  The Flower Power even bests the more expensive Koubachi on this test.

The ambient temperature and ambient light tests were similarly successful.  In both cases, the Flower Power was slow to react to spikes, but always within an acceptable range of error.

The fertilizer test was not as accurate.  Flower Power tracks the amount of fertilizer in the soil by measuring electrical connectivity.  Since moisture is a big factor in conductivity, the meter will only take readings shortly after you've watered your plant.  On the positive side, this allows the system to avoid overreacting to drops in conductivity due to decreasing moisture levels.  Flower Power won't tell you to fertilize every time you need to water; that would be disastrous.  This is also why fertilizer isn't available for Live Mode. The downside is this results in slow, stagnant readings that seem more like guesses.

In the chart above, we fertilized and watered on the second day, and you can see the spike created by these actions above.  The Flower Power didn't react to the change until after the weekend passed, and only then by jumping to a seemingly random high point.  It's guessing. Again, if you looked at the chart and thought you needed to fertilize again when it got back to it's initial point, you'd be giving it more fertilizer two days later and would be badly overdoing it for almost any plant.  Thus, Parrot's device is smart to only take readings at certain times, but it's fertilizer readings are still an unreliable measurement.

Because of its mostly accurate readings, and helpful database, the Parrot Flower Power serves a few functions well.  Its recommendations for care are broad, but if you're trying to figure out how to help a suffering plant, ""move to a sunnier spot"" might be exactly what you need to hear.  It's Bluetooth range is also comparatively small, but will serve you just fine if you have a compatible Apple device and are checking on plants in adjacent rooms of your home.  Finally, it stores and charts data long term, providing a valuable service to those looking to study changes in their garden over time.

Nevertheless, it lacks automation and specificity.  If, like me, you have a black thumb and need help keeping plants alive,  Oso Technologies' PlantLink  will serve you much better.  If you need more advanced monitoring for long-term care, it might be worth the extra money for the $130 Koubachi sensor. Parrot's Flower Power has trouble with communication, and thus, doesn't quite stack up to these other connected garden sensors."
Control your house with Apple's Siri-enabled software platform|"

Apple teased its HomeKit software platform for iOS 8 at the 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference. Its basic premise: Today's smart home is a bit disorganized. So many different products and protocols exist that you're spending most of your time trying to manage multiple apps rather than enjoying the convenience of automation that's truly hands-free.

The tech giant kept things pretty vague back then, but what it did share really piqued our interest. It referenced a ""common network protocol,"" the potential for individual and multi-device automation, secure pairing and Siri integration.

But the HomeKit rollout has been disjointed at best. While the first batch of HomeKit-compatible products hit retail just days before WWDC 2015 (about a year after the original announcement), the annual developers conference came and went with only  a brief mention of HomeKit and it didn't come up at all at the September 9 event where the  iPhone 6S, the iPad Pro and the new Apple TV debuted. So, where does Apple's smart home platform stand today?

HomeKit works with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocols and it integrates with Siri when your phone is connected to your local network. You will need a third-generation Apple TV if you want to use Siri when your phone is connected to a cellular or a remote Wi-Fi network, though.

An Apple support page provides further details: ""If you have an Apple TV (third generation or later) with software version 7.0 or later, you can control your HomeKit-enabled accessories when you're away from home using your iOS device. Sign in with the same Apple ID on your iOS device and Apple TV, and you'll be able to use Siri commands to remotely control your accessories.""

You can also add your Apple Watch into the HomeKit mix, provided the product has a watch-supported app. And you can use Siri, but getting it to work is pretty tedious right now. Although the Apple Watch version of Siri can answer basic questions and perform simple commands, some queries are too complex for it to handle.

Instead, those questions have to be passed to an iPhone via a feature called ""Handoff."" So, if you ask Siri to turn off a light -- or another complex HomeKit-related command -- it will reply with, ""I can help you control your home when you use Handoff on your iPhone."" Basically, that means that you'll have to grab your iPhone and swipe up from the small Siri icon that will appear on the lock screen. It isn't hard, but it's an extra step that I wish wasn't there.

The tech giant had already secured various HomeKit partnerships from the  August Smart Lock to Honeywell's line of  Wi-Fi Smart Thermostats ,  Ecobee's Ecobee3 thermostat ,  Philips Hue LEDs and more (some of these products are available for purchase now, while others are en route soon). And, even though Apple hasn't committed to an official HomeKit product launch, we've already tested a few products that work with this iOS-based software platform, including  Lutron's new HomeKit-enabled Smart Bridge , the  Elgato Eve Room air quality sensor  and the  iHome iSP5 SmartPlug .

But, the smart home is growing fast and the fledgling HomeKit is already facing a serious challenge from  Google's Brillo and Wave Android-based smart home operating system, announced in May. Amazon is also becoming a major player with its Echo wireless voice control speaker, compatible with  a growing number of connected devices.

Apple needs to pick up the pace to stay competitive in the smart home arena, but it does seem to be plugging away at its HomeKit-enabled product releases, with connected window shades, carbon monoxide detectors and motion sensors slated for upcoming integration. We'll keep an eye out for these and other announcements, so stay tuned for updates."
This voice-activated smart hub feels Homey|"

Homey is a voice-activated home automation hub created by Netherlands-based startup Athom. Athom recently launched Homey on Kickstarter with a €100,000 (roughly $136,000, £81,350, or AU$146,700) goal. There are 27 days left on the campaign and the project has already surpassed its funding expectations (last I checked, it had raised almost €116,000 -- about $158,200, £94,350, or AU$170,000 -- from over 560 backers).

Not only is that a sign that smart home stuff is alive and well in crowdsourcing-land, it also shows that folks are interested in seeing something a bit different. Where classic hubs like  Revolv  simply have an app and a bunch of wireless radios, Homey adds voice control. Yes, Homey still comes with an Android and iOS app and it can still communicate with a bunch of differently-configured gadgets at once via Raspberry Pi-enabled Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, ZigBee, Z-Wave, 433.92 MHz, nRF24l01+, and infrared, but you can also talk to it.

It's multi-lingual, too. So far, Homey understands English, Dutch, Spanish, and French (with plans to expand based on the success of the Kickstarter campaign). Plus, Homey is already compatible with a bunch of app-enabled smart home products and expects to add more over time.

Homey isn't the first home automation hub that responds to voice commands, though. CastleOS has been around since late 2012, but its central hub and Kinect voice control app can only operate on a Windows computer. HouseLogix's VoicePod is another such voice-activated hub. We've also seen similar functionality show up on single products, like the  Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat with Voice Control , but we weren't particularly impressed with its limited range of commands.

While there's a fine line between true convenience and novelty with voice control, I'm still curious to see what Homey can do and its many backers seem to agree. When the Kickstarter campaign first launched, you had to pledge at least €179 (about $244, £145, AU$263) to get a Homey unit of your very own. That contribution level sold out fast, so you have to spend at least €229 (about $312, £186, AU$336) to reserve one now. With the funding goal already met, Athom expects to be able to ship Homey to backers in the first half of 2015."
Oso Technologies PlantLink review:|"

Oso Technologies' PlantLink is hoping to usher your garden into the Internet of things.  The $79 package consists of a ""Basestation"" that you can attach to your Wi-Fi router, and a moisture sensor called a ""Link"" that you insert in the soil next to the plant you want to monitor.  Additional Links are available for $35 each and connect to the same Basestation.

The idea is that the sensors will pick up readings from the soil and pass that information up to the cloud. Just like that...your plants can now tell you when you need to take care of them.

Quick, accurate recommendations and a charming dose of personality give PlantLink its appeal. The recommendations lack specificity, but the signal range from Link sensor to Basestation is great, and since additional sensors are so cheap, the system is easily scalable.  Whether you're a black-thumbed beginner who needs help keeping multiple houseplants alive or a gardener who wants basic monitoring throughout your yard, PlantLink is worth considering.

Basestations and Links are available to buy now from the company's website, with additional Links shipping from late June.

The best feature of the PlantLink system is its ability to monitor multiple plants simultaneously.  The $35 cost for each extra sensor makes them among the cheapest available, and Oso claims each Basestation can connect with up to 64 sensors.  The sensors work inside and outside, and held up well under our simulated rainfall (spritzing with a spray bottle).  They connect to the Basestation via a dedicated ZigBee radio signal, and the long range and low energy of the frequency make it possible to monitor the plants throughout a house and small yard.

That signal transmits the moisture level of the soil near your plant to the Basestation, and the system compares it with your plant's ideal moisture level. Since the Basestation is attached to your Wi-Fi router, you can see all of this information from any Internet-enabled device with a Web browser. Oso is also promising dedicated PlantLink iOS and Android apps soon.

I found the simple white look of the PlantLink sensor and matching base station understated and attractive.  Placing the sensor next to your plant does little to distract the eye; the plant is still the star of its pot.

The package includes an Ethernet cable, a USB cable, and a power adapter.  The box itself is cardboard and the instructions simply direct you to the company website for a walk-through.  The recyclable packaging and paperless directions are an eco-friendly touch.

The physical setup is easy, and the website guides you through it with step-by-step pictures.  You need to plug the base station into your router.  The light on the front turns green so you know you have a connection.  Then, you push a button under the casing of the sensor to link it to the base.  The base station light changes colors so you know when the process is complete.  Stick the sensor in the soil by your plant and the physical setup is done.

It only took me a few minutes to go from opening the box to inserting the Link in the soil, and the PlantLink was ready to get started trying to stop my herbicidal ways.

Once the physical pieces are in place, you tell the PlantLink system about the plant you're monitoring, so it can provide you with tailored recommendations.  Registration on the website is quick; it only asks for the name of the plant and the type of soil.

You'll give your plant a nickname too, so you can readily identify which one is which if you have multiple sensors.  The nickname option begins to reveal PlantLink's charm, and I really appreciated being able to view my plants by the quirky names I gave them.  By personalizing my plants, PlantLink took a smart, subtle step toward inspiring me to keep them alive.

Other plant sensors on the market ask for more specifics.  They check whether the plant is indoors or outside, and some can even use dedicated mobile applications and Bluetooth signals to track the specific location of the plant.

Competitors also have databases that are significantly more helpful in terms of identifying your plant.  If you know the scientific name of the plant you want to monitor, this won't concern you, but if you don't, the PlantLink's database won't be of much help.  There are no pictures or descriptions to browse.  Occasionally, even knowing the colloquial name of the plant isn't enough, as its poor search software won't recognize even minor deviations in your search.

This isn't a deal breaker, as there are plenty of  	 	websites capable of helping you out.  Still, it's certainly an inconvenience to have to look elsewhere, especially since Oso boasts of the PlantLink's 50,000-plant database as a major selling point.  Compared with  competitors that only catalog 6,000 or 7,000 plants, PlantLink's database is certainly impressive -- but it's handcuffed by its own software. It fails to offer a way for novices to successfully navigate or gather information from it.

Identifying your soil type isn't any easier.  You can't just say ""topsoil"" or ""soil with fertilizer"" and leave it at that.  Instead, you're forced to pick from options like loam or silt.  For experienced gardeners, this might not matter, but it places another complication in front of the earnest amateur. A visual guide, or a ""don't know"" option would be useful here.

Get through these hoops, and the PlantLink will start gathering moisture readings.  It calculates the soil moisture level in terms of percentage: 100 percent is completely saturated, 0 percent is dry.  Within an hour, the PlantLink Basestation will display the current percentage on a chart, along with the ideal percentage range of your plant.

This is where the system finally puts that database to use, providing you with your plant's specific sweet spot between ""Too Dry"" and ""Too Wet.""  Follow PlantLink's recommendations and keep the soil's moisture level in the middle, and your plant should stay healthy -- well, as far as watering goes.

With my plant, the recommendation simply read, ""Water Today!""  The lack of specificity worried me.  I've managed to drown almost as many plants as I've forgotten to water, and if the PlantLink is trying to end my reign of garden-based terror, it needs to give me a little more information here to stop me from going overboard with the watering.  The range and percentages on the chart will be more than enough for any caretaker with experience, but it again forces those of us without a green thumb to seek outside information or do a little guesswork.

Nevertheless, given that it would be hard to kill most plants in one instance of overwatering, taking a wild guess, then adapting next time based on where the chart ended up is a fine, if imprecise, approach. The PlantLink will even help out with its refreshed readings.  If you've watered enough, it will estimate the next date you should water.  If not, it'll ask for more.  The timeliness of these recommendations puts them miles ahead of the competition.  Other smart sensors can take several hours or even a full day just for an initial reading. From there, they generally take at least a week for that first plant-specific recommendation.

The PlantLink adjusts its recommendations based on the readings of the sensor as the conditions of the soil change over time.  By the time you need to water again, it will be ready to predict a long-term watering schedule, with the days marked on a pull-up calendar.  With no location settings, it can't take weather into account for outdoor plants like the other systems can, but again, you will have a customized schedule to look at in about the same amount of time it takes the other guys to craft their initial recommendation.

Finally, you can even customize the desired ranges for your plant's moisture, and the PlantLink will track just as readily within your new parameters.  This flexibility for experts causes me to doubt how certain Oso feels about its own recommendations.  It could be a result of Oso having to do a little stipulation for house plants not explicitly covered by the USDA database they use, but the ones I checked were fine. There are chefs that like to play with every recipe, and Oso might simply be trying to accommodate that.

Since it only measures moisture, the PlantLink system is more limited than the other smart sensors we're testing.  Some of these can measure temperature, ambient light, and even fertilizer and make recommendations accordingly.  The  Parrot Flower Power covers all of this for only $60.  Again, the PlantLink package starts at $79 and gives you less.  Regular, non-Internet-connected moisture sensors can even be obtained from any hardware store for as little as $10.

Given all of this, the PlantLink looks expensive.  But it makes up the cost quickly as you add units to your system. With the Parrot, you'll need to pay another $60 for each unit, while the $129  Koubachi Wi-Fi plant monitor is even more expensive. Since additional units for the PlantLink are only $35, you'll already be saving money over the Parrot after your second sensor.  With its excellent connection range, the PlantLink makes it possible to cheaply spread coverage throughout a moderately sized yard.

The ZigBee frequency used by PlantLink sensors is precisely aimed, meaning it can stretch farther than either a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signal. The stated range is 10 to 100 meters, which will vary based on how many walls are in the way, but I was impressed with how well it transmitted in a variety of less-than-ideal locations.  Our router is in an electronics closet behind thick walls. I took the pot with the link past several more walls, outside to the company parking lot, and placed it 90 meters away.  It still sent updates at 10- to 15-minute intervals.

The low energy of the signal also results in great battery life.  You can monitor the status of the included AAAA batteries (yep, that's a quadruple A) via your computer along with everything else, and the percentage didn't move for days.  Oso claims they'll last for more than a year, and I'm inclined to believe that.

The charm PlantLink establishes with those nicknames really started to shine through for me after the range test.  It might not be the smartest gadget, but it only claims to help with one thing, and after an initial adjustment period, it'll help you do that one thing quite well.  It's an honest and constant sentry, monitoring your plant and guarding it both from unpredictable changes and predictable negligence. When your plant gets thirsty, PlantLink gives it the voice it needs to let you know.

As you create your ""myplantlink"" account, you can also set a variety of options for alerts and reminders.  Wanting to see what kind of notifications I would get, I let the plant dry out.  Sure enough, the notifications came through, along with more of PlantLink's distinct charm.

The email reminder is great.  It gets to the point quickly with a bit of humor in tow, and my cold, plant-killing heart melted at the idea of my plant begging for its life.  It shows restraint when it comes to bombarding you.  Even with all four time settings turned on, it didn't keep pestering me over and over with the same reminder.

You'll still get reminders about once a day if you forget, but it knows enough not to send you the same email every couple of hours, lest it cause you to lose that feeling of mercy and launch your plant out of the window.  It reminds you of the task, but does so gently.

Disappointingly, the text was missing the same humor, and the email reminder doesn't vary.  The initial humor vanishes quickly over the course of a few emails.  Still, it's a nice touch at first, and it helps cement the impression that this is a simple but very dedicated robot.  Once the calendar is set, it's even polite enough to send reminders the day before your scheduled watering, and the status page will thank you after you've given your plant what it needs.

You'll still have to go through the trouble of actually watering the plant yourself.  Some  	 	 competing systems include valves you can attach to your irrigation system.  If you have automatic sprinklers, these valves can turn them on when your plants need water and adjust the schedule accordingly.  Oso has promised this for PlantLink soon.

The smart features it does have would mean little if the PlantLink couldn't accurately measure moisture.  It certainly is a fun garden guardian, but all goodwill it builds with its diligence and humor would vanish quickly if it were giving me bad advice.

Fortunately, the PlantLink nails the accuracy tests.  We set a Link up in a pot with a ponytail palm and a separate calibrated meter for moisture levels.  Over the course of a month, the PlantLink showed readings consistent with our control meter.

The deviation at first is an acceptable range of error.  The soil we used was porous and the meters weren't in the exact same spot, so small differences in data were expected.  The fact that the PlantLink's data gets closer and closer to the control data over time as the soil settles and the watering schedule gains consistency is exactly what we were hoping for.  All smart sensors we tested sensed accurately, but the PlantLink edges them out and gets better as it goes.

And since it held up well under our simulated rainfall and temperature variations, you can confidently place the PlantLink sensors throughout your yard and rely on them to accurately keep you posted.

Oso's PlantLink isn't the smartest sensor system around, but it works hard with what it has, and does so accurately and with some humor.  A few of its setup shortcomings might turn off the most casual of gardeners though. And without any advice on sunlight or fertilizer, for instance, you might be forced to consult additional resources for long-term plant care.

Other smart sensors can do all of this for you.  A single  	 	 Parrot Flower Power costs less and measures more, and cheap devices from any hardware store can help you check moisture readings.  Additionally, professionals who need more detailed information (and are willing to pay a little extra to get it) will find a better fit in the  Koubachi sensor.

Still, for quick, accurate readings and recommendations, top-of-the-line range, and ease and cost of scalability, PlantLink is hard to beat.  If you're ready to become a dedicated amateur, and need something to help you monitor the water level of a few household plants, or if you like gardening in your free time and need help checking on a large area of your yard, PlantLink will do the job perfectly well, and give your plants the voice -- and the personality -- that you never knew they needed."
An intelligent, sneaky, wireless camera for the ultra-connected home|"

According to startup Butterfleye, traditional Web and IP cameras are just not smart enough. The company's new battery-powered camera, also called Butterfleye, will supposedly change all that. Envisioned to merge Nest thermostat-style intelligence with Dropcam-esque capabilities, the $199/£125/AU$275 Butterfleye, available for preorder now on Indiegogo, has eyes and ears trained on happenings in the home. And, thanks to a built-in Bluetooth sensor and thermal-mapping tech, it should be able to differentiate among family members, unregistered strangers and even pets.

Equipped with a microphone, camera, along with an IR heat-mapping eye, the Butterfleye pays close attention to activity around the house.

The idea here is for the camera to function only when it needs to, which not only saves power but won't trigger false alarms for intruders (when serving as a home sentry) or record continuously for no good reason. Of course you can tweak what criteria will make the device leap into action via a companion Android and iOS mobile app.

Additionally Butterfleye says users can manually fire up the camera remotely and tap into its sensors through smartphones and tablets. It also features HD video quality (1,920x1080) and a rechargeable battery that's designed to last for up to 2 weeks in heavily-trafficked areas and for up to 1 month in areas that are visited less frequently.

That sounds pretty good, but Butterfleye isn't the only brand with this sort of functionality. The $150  Homeboy camera  doesn't offer live streaming or HD video quality, but its built-in siren, auto-arming mode via your phone's GPS location and long-lasting rechargeable battery make it an appealing DIY option. It also offers night-vision functionality and an IFTTT channel, which Butterfleye doesn't currently support.

The $199  Nest Cam , the $189  Samsung SmartCam HD Pro  and  IControl's Piper  are also appealing DIY security cameras, but all of them require constant power adapter connectivity to function properly.

Another concern, or plus depending on how you see it, will be the temptation to set up the Butterfleye in stealthy locations which raises all sorts of ethical concerns. Keeping tabs on when your kids are really going to sleep is one thing, but spying on unsuspecting third-parties of course also introduces its own ethical concerns.

The Butterfleye touts a lot of nifty capabilities and it is now available for preorder on Indiegogo for a minimum contribution of $199/£125/AU$275. The campaign just launched, but the team hopes to raise $100,000 toward its connected camera. Butterfleye offers international shipping and backers should receive their units as early as this December. We'll be sure to track down a review unit at that time."
Light Sentry oversees your home lighting needs|"

Light Sentry is a newly-launched Kickstarter campaign by Sonne Industries. The main components include a central hub, a natural light sensor, and a gizmo (called a portable power gate) that acts as an intermediary between your connected light fixture and the hub. This hardware is designed to help you automate and optimize your home lighting schedules.

Existing devices that turn your lights on or off on a set schedule don't necessarily account for power outages or changes in sunset/sunrise time. Light Sentry does. It relies on real-time lighting conditions and time to auto-adjust your lights based on rules you set. After that initial setup, you're supposedly done -- there's no need to worry about making adjustments based on seasonal changes like Daylight Savings Time, etc. The whole concept kind of reminds me of transitions lenses (You know, those glasses that change from clear indoors to sunglasses in full light?) or auto-headlights.

Sonne Industries claims that its Light Sentry setup is DIY. Simply plug the Light Sentry hub into an outlet, stick the natural light sensor anywhere (inside or outside) that has direct access to outdoor light, and the sensor is supposed to transmit light readings back to the hub. Then, connect your portable power gates to any lights you want to program.

The portable power gates can be set to dim incandescent, LED, or CFL bulbs at 25, 50, 75, or 100 percent brightness. They are designed to work with lamps and other gadgets up to 600W, and have an override option in case you want to temporarily stray from your established lighting schedule. You can use the Web-based interface to create custom commands for every portable power gate.

You can set commands (on, dim, or off) based on light, dark, time, or a combination of the three. In addition to the convenience of a fully automated lighting system that self-adjusts based on real-time cues, Light Sentry could also help with money and energy savings. And while it's currently only available for indoor use, outdoor portable power gates are in the works, contingent on the success of the Kickstarter campaign. The Light Sentry funding period started on May 14 with a $200,000 goal. The last time I checked, it had received $13,788 in funding, but there's still 28 days to go -- in case you want to back this project."
Look out, Belkin: SAM's upping the smart plug ante|"

We've seen plenty of competition emerge for Belkin's WeMo line of  simple home automation switches , but new challengers from Campbell, Calif.-based start-up SensePlug.io have me especially intrigued. Debuting today on Kickstarter, SensePlug.io's SAM devices promise smarter smart home management, with a WeMo-like plug for $49 and a connected power strip for $109 (or less, if you catch the limited early-bird discounts).

Like the WeMo Switch, both SAM products communicate with your phone via Wi-Fi and offer remote control and local automation through a dedicated app, along with the promise of integration with IFTTT, a popular automation service.

Where the SAM products set themselves apart is the addition of built-in environmental sensors capable of tracking motion, light, and temperature. With just one $49 SAM plug, you'll be able to turn a lamp on automatically when it gets dark, or turn an air conditioner on when it gets too hot. WeMo Switches can't do that -- at least not on their own.

On top of that, the SAM plug and power strip will both track energy consumption, allowing you to program your appliances to turn off once they've consumed a certain amount of energy. Belkin's  WeMo Insight Switch  offers the same power-tracking functionality -- but at $59, it's more expensive than SAM's Kickstarter price, and it doesn't have those extra sensors.

As for the $109 SAM power strip, it boasts three smart outlets and two smart USB ports capable of sending you notifications when your devices are fully charged. This puts it ahead of the less expensive  Quirky Pivot Power Genius , which only offers two smart outlets and zero USB ports, and way ahead of Belkin, which doesn't offer a connected power strip at all.

One thing to note -- like the recently-previewed  Orbnext color-changing LED cube , SensePlug.io might be jumping the gun by promising IFTTT support at this point. Products and services can't apply for dedicated IFTTT channels until they're available to the general public, and both SAM devices aren't expected to start shipping to backers until November.

Still, the team at SensePlug.io tells me that they're optimistic about their future with IFTTT, and, even beyond IFTTT integration, claim that they offer robust ""if-this-then-that"" style automation directly through their own app, thanks to those integrated environmental triggers.

Both SAM devices will be available to Kickstarter backers through June 15, when the campaign comes to a close. Given that Belkin's already facing new competition from companies like D-Link, it'll be interesting to see what comes next should SensePlug.io hit their funding goals -- and more importantly, deliver on the lofty promise of a better smart plug."
New LawnBott robo-mower gets smarter with an app|"

Most people will walk away when they find out the LawnBott LB85EL costs $2,799. If you don't want to spend your time mowing, that upfront cost is huge compared with what you'll pay a human to mow for you (especially if that human happens to be your financially dependent offspring).

And yet. Similar to the Roomba, there's something transfixing about the little LawnBott and the way it bops around your yard. During a demo here in Louisville, I found the LawnBott quiet and unobtrusive. The sculpted, cherry red cover has a Ferrari-style flair (Kyodo America only distributes LawnBott in the US, but the originating company is Italian firm Zucchetti Centro Sistemi). The fact that this new model gives you control via iOS or Andriod app rather than a clunky onboard LED screen makes programming LawnBott that much more convenient.

The move to app-based controls and scheduling in the new LB85EL is perhaps remarkable only because it happened in a robot lawn mower before it came to a robot vacuum, by far the more popular kind of home maintenance bot. New features beyond the app include three rows of the the cog-style wheels (up from two rows), which reduce slipping and let the LawnBott maintain traction on inclines up to 25 degrees. You can also assign the new LawnBott to cover up to four different zones in your yard, compared with three zones from last year's LB75DX.

LawnBott says the LB85EL will work for about 3 hours before it automatically heads back to the docking station to recharge. It can cut to heights ranging from 0.75 inches to 2.8 inches, thanks to a 12-inch replaceable cutting blade. A rain sensor will tell it to head for the charging station, where its water-resistant design will protect its electronics from moisture damage.

Buying any robot mower is still more involved than its robot vacuum counterpart. Similar to an electric dog fence, you need to bury a guidance wire around the perimeter of the area you want them to mow. And while the LB85EL is rated for lawns up to 24,000 square feet (2,230 square meters, or just over half  an acre), due to its 6.9 Ah Li-Ion battery, the LawnBott will take multiple runs, over multiple days for the bot to finish a yard that big once you account for the three-hour charging time.

Thankfully, the LawnBott is so quiet that you can run it at night without expecting guff from your neighbors. That multi-day scheduling also helps explain the benefit of the app-based interface. Now you can adjust the schedule on your phone instead of having to run outside to the unit itself to tell it to skip a day.

You can buy other units from LawnBott or elsewhere to handle larger  yards, but prices escalate quickly. The LawnBott LB300EL, rated to  64,000 square feet or about 1.5 acres, goes for around $5,200. At $2,800 to cover half an acre, the LB85EL sits at the top of the price scale as the other robomowers with similar range for sale in the US, namely the similarly app-enabled Friendly Robotics Robomow RS 622 ($1,700) and the Husqvarna Automower 230 ACX ($2,700).

Robot mowers are much more popular in Europe than in the US due to the aforementioned cost issues as compared with human labor. I suspect eliminating the guide wire and improving battery life so that it could finish a whole lawn in a single session might also speed wider American adoption. All of those hurdles might become smaller with increased competition here. According to the Kyodo American representative we spoke with, John Deere, Honda, and even iRobot are all exploring entry into the US market."
Cree's new T8 LED sets its sights on the commercial sector|"

LED lighting looks to be the emerging standard for the post-incandescent age -- but you wouldn't know it from looking at the commercial sector, where linear fluorescent lighting still reigns supreme. With over 2 billion fluorescent sockets running hot for business hours and beyond, these kinds of bulbs account for 42 percent of all lighting electricity consumed, per the US Department of Energy.

That's a lot of lights, and upstart LED manufacturer Cree wants to get in on the action with its new T8 LED, a tubular bulb designed to fit into 90 percent of existing T-8 fluorescent ballasts -- no rewiring necessary.

Cree's T8 LED uses 21 watts to produce 2,100 lumens' worth of light at a color temperature of 3,500K or 4,000K, and it's rated to last 50,000 hours. On top of all that, it boasts an impressive CRI (color rendering index) of 90. Compared with buzzy, flickering fluorescents -- which aren't as efficient and don't last as long -- Cree's LED looks like an obvious upgrade. Chuck Swoboda, Cree's chairman and CEO, goes as far as saying, ""There's no reason to install another linear fluorescent tube again.""

I'm betting that plenty of businesses will beg to differ. At $30 per bulb, Cree's T8 LED is dramatically more expensive than comparable T-8 fluorescents, which can retail for less than $2 each when bought in bulk. Even with the lower energy consumption, it would still take about a decade or more for Cree's T8 LED to make up that kind of price difference.

The real target of these LEDs might be business owners operating in regions that offer significant energy rebates for the adoption of high-efficiency lighting. The T8 LED was recently added to the DesignLights Consortium's list of qualified products, which rates commercial lighting in the same way that Energy Star rates residential lighting. That should qualify it for rebates ranging from $2 to $15 per bulb in participating regions, potentially making the T8 LED a much more appealing investment.

Rebates aside, business owners might still be drawn to Cree's T8 LED for its longer life span, as well as the fact that, unlike fluorescents, it contains no mercury. The T8 LED also promises to turn on instantly, and Cree claims it's compatible with most dimmable ballasts, too.

The T8 LED is available now in the US and Canada through Cree's distribution network, and comes with a 5-year warranty, which is a step down from the 10-year warranty found on Cree's residential bulbs, like its   popular 60W replacement LED . Consumers and business owners seeking more information on the specific energy rebates offered in their region can check out the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE)."
Cree adds floodlights to its LED lineup (hands-on)|"

Cree, the upstart LED lighting manufacturer headquartered in North Carolina, is again expanding its portfolio of bargain LED bulbs. The company's latest offering is a new line of 90W replacement PAR38 bulbs designed with spot, flood, and outdoor lighting applications in mind. The new LEDs will offer two beam angle options, output 1,500 lumens from 18W of power usage, and retail for $24.97 at Home Depot.

That price makes Cree's PAR38 LED more affordable than comparable LEDs from competing manufacturers, which typically cost at least $30 or more. While not a huge price drop, it's considerable news for anyone looking to replace a whole home's worth of the bulbs.

The ""PAR"" in PAR38 stands for parabolic aluminized reflector, which simply means that there's metal beneath the diode that catches any downward directed light and reflects it back up and out. This makes for a bulb that shines a bright, focused beam straight outward -- the same approach used by the headlights in your car. The 38 refers to the approximate diameter of the bulb, in eighths of an inch.

Cree's PAR38 comes in two varieties, each with its own beam angle. Consumers looking for track lighting and other types of focused, spot-style display lights will want to stick with the 27-degree-beam-angle model. For a broader pool of light that's better suited for general-purpose lighting and recessed fixtures, a bulb with a 47-degree beam angle is also available.

In addition to being UL Rated for dampness survival, Cree's new bulbs are wetness-rated, too. That means that they should be able to stand up to direct contact with water, making for a more dependable source of outdoor light.

Cree is also touting the bulb's lightweight design, which the company claims makes the PAR38 weigh less than similar bulbs thanks to a thermal management system that uses less metal. The bulb weighs 11.8 ounces, which is heavy when compared with bulbs that use a more traditional shape (almost twice as heavy as  Cree's own 100W replacement ).

Compared to the competition, Cree's PAR38 LED looks like a brighter option. A comparable 90W replacement PAR38 LED from Philips retails for $32.97 and only puts out a disappointing 950 lumens from 18W. Bulbs from TCP and EcoSmart also have significantly lower light outputs than Cree's bulb.

Like the rest of Cree's LEDs, the PAR38 bulbs promise 25,000-hour life spans and come with a 10-year warranty. Though they aren't expected to start showing up on store shelves for another few weeks, interested consumers can order them online starting today from HomeDepot.com."
Iro smart controller seeks to simplify your home sprinkler setup|"

Spring is here, homeowners, and that means that it's time to start thinking about your yard again. Lucky for you, lawn care startup Rachio wants to help. Its Iro smart sprinkler controller is designed to simplify scheduling and save you money.

Iro connects to your home Wi-Fi and can be controlled from anywhere via smartphone app. Prices start at $249 for an 8-zone controller and go up to $299 for a 16-zone controller. It looks a little like the  Nest Protect  smoke and carbon monoxide detector -- definitely an improvement on current sprinkler controller design.

Iro says that setup can be completed in just three steps. Remove your existing irrigation controller, install Iro in its place, and download the Iro app on your Android or iOS device. Not only will it schedule like your old system, it will also use Wi-Fi to monitor local weather and adjust itself accordingly. A 100 percent chance of rain? Iro won't let your sprinklers run. The idea is that you will save money without having to spend as much time tracking the forecast. What a beautiful thought.

Iro will even send you reports detailing your monthly water usage. And if you lose your Wi-Fi connection for any reason, Iro will notify you that it has lost its signal and continue to operate using the last schedule you programmed. It isn't equipped with a backup battery, though, so it won't work during a power outage. Iro units are available for pre-order now, and the first shipment is expected to go out in early May."
Samsung SmartCam HD Pro review:|"

Samsung's $189 SmartCam HD Pro was designed to compete directly with the $199  	 	 Dropcam Pro . As far as IP cameras go, both offer straightforward setup, an impressive array of app-related features, and 1080p resolution, but the Dropcam Pro still feels like a more-complete camera. The Dropcam Pro's camera is durable yet streamlined; both its Web and mobile apps are thoughtfully designed, and the video quality is particularly crisp. The SmartCam HD Pro is still a very good camera that offers appealing extras such as local SD storage, but I would still spend the additional $10 for the Dropcam Pro's superior app interface and video quality. And if you're looking for a more security-focused, wireless networked camera, consider the $239  Piper  all-in-one security system.

11 
Shining a spotlight on Samsung's Smartcam HD Pro (pictures)

The SmartCam HD Pro looks much more like a mini smoke detector than an IP camera. Its 10.3 ounces is definitely bordering on clunky compared to the 5.7-ounce Dropcam Pro. And while the Samsung's design is bigger, it doesn't feel nearly as durable as the Dropcam Pro. That's probably because Samsung's camera has  a lot of plastic components, while the Dropcam Pro is decked out in substantial-feeling metal parts. That also makes the $189 SmartCam HD Pro feel significantly cheaper than the $199 Dropcam Pro.

The SmartCam HD Pro is available in a glossy white finish that isn't exactly inconspicuous, but it isn't terribly offensive, either. Like the Dropcam Pro, you do have the option of mounting your camera on a wall or using the base to place it on a flat surface. Here's a comparison chart of major Samsung SmartCam HD Pro and Dropcam Pro features and capabilities:

While there are a lot of basic similarities between the two cameras, there are two glaring differences. Samsung's IP offers SD card storage (whereas the Dropcam Pro offers optional cloud-based recording starting at $9.95/month or $99/year) and the Dropcam Pro has additional home automation opportunities via Bluetooth low energy (BLE). Also, the SmartCam HD Pro's 128-degree field of view versus the Dropcam Pro's 130-degree field of view may not seem significant on paper, but there's a pretty noticeable difference between the two when you're watching live footage on the app.

Speaking of the app, Samsung makes sure that you have plenty of features to customize your experience. You can adjust the speaker and microphone for sensitivity, there's a night vision feature that you can turn on or off as needed, and there's also an optional wide dynamic range (WDR) feature. Strong light can cause other things inside your house to appear darker; opting into WDR will fix that. I found that it worked extremely well.

You can also turn on motion and/or audio detection and adjust the sensitivity of both, depending on your needs. Then you will receive notifications whenever an event is triggered. The Manual Recording option will send video (both recorded events and continuous recordings) to your microSD card, Capture saves video frames to your photo album, and Two-way Talk lets you speak to someone in your home directly from the camera.



Samsung also loaded a few lullabies into the app, so you can press the music notes icon for an instant baby monitor. Video brightness and the ability to select up to three zones inside your home for targeted motion detection are also features available to you on the app. A lot of options are packed into both the mobile and Web apps, but the design is underwhelming and utilitarian. The Dropcam apps, on the other hand, are both functional and visually appealing.



Setting up the camera was painless. Simply download the app on your connected device and follow the instructions.  I used an iPhone 5, and the whole process took me less than 10 minutes.

While the mobile app offers a lot of features, the layout wasn't as simple as I would have liked. For instance, some of the features are displayed on the live video feed, while others are located in a separate menu section. The options on the live feed are displayed as icons. Some, like the music notes, are obvious, while others, such as the image capture icon, aren't quite as intuitive. Still, it's pretty easy to use the app to interact with the camera (still, I prefer Dropcam's app over Samsung's).

I caught fellow CNET staffer Ry Crist walking back to his desk and took a screen shot from both apps for comparison. I noticed a clear difference in video quality between the SmartCam HD Pro and the Dropcam Pro. Both are good, but the Dropcam Pro is noticeably better -- that was consistent throughout testing.



You're going to notice different lag times across Wi-Fi connections, but I wanted to see if anything stood out, and in doing so found some interesting results. Using the Web app, the Dropcam Pro had a significant 5-second lag time, while the Samsung model was only about 1 to 2 seconds behind. Then, when I switched to the mobile app, they were much closer. Still, the Samsung model tended to have a shorter overall lag time.

I also set up motion and audio alerts to receive notifications whenever the camera sensed movement or noise in the area. At first, I received only sound alerts. I made a quick adjustment to the motion alert sensitivity and began to receive consistent movement notifications. Every time an event was triggered, I received an alert.

While I really like the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro, I still think the Dropcam Pro is a superior IP camera. Samsung's app could use a bit of work, the camera felt flimsy, and the video quality wasn't as sharp as the Dropcam Pro's. Still, if you're a devotee of SD cards, the SmartCam is the way to go. Overall, though, I'd spend the extra 10 bucks and get a Dropcam Pro instead."
Lifx review:|"

We've seen potential in the Lifx smart LED since first reviewing it in the spring of 2014. With 1,000 lumens to  Philips Hue's  600, Lifx claims to be the brighter, better color-changer -- and a more accessible one, too. Unlike Hue bulbs, which require you to plug a ZigBee bridge into your router, Lifx bulbs have Wi-Fi radios built right in. That makes each one usable right out of of the box, with no bridge or hub necessary.

The hardware is certainly sound with Lifx -- it's still one of the brightest and most powerful color-changing smart LEDs you can currently buy. The software, however, has always left a little to be desired. In my initial review, I was disappointed by the lack of key features like scheduling or custom color cycles. Compared with the well-developed Hue ecosystem, Lifx had a lot of catching up to do.

Now, after about a year on the market, Lifx has made up some of that ground. It was one of the first third-party products to  integrate directly with the Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Protect smoke detector, and as of last week, it has an IFTTT channel, too. There's also a new version of the app, although most of the features I've been waiting for still aren't there -- instead, they've been more or less outsourced to IFTTT.

All in all, Lifx has come a long way, and if you've been waiting for the brains to catch up with the brawn, that's welcome news. At $99 per bulb, it's definitely a bit of an investment -- though keep in mind, you'll need to spend a minimum of $199 to get started with Philips Hue.

The Lifx eschews the traditional, rounded bulb design in favor of a flat-top approach. Coupled with its coarse-grained plastic body (available in either black or light gray), the Lifx has an appropriately luxurious look and feel. Even before flipping it on, you can tell it isn't an ordinary light.

With 17 watts powering it (twice as many as the Philips Hue), the Lifx bulb promises to put out up to 1,000 lumens at peak brightness, which puts it in the ballpark of a 75-watt incandescent, which will typically put out 1,100 lumens.

Peak brightness typically applies to a color-changing bulb's white light, with the colored light coming in significantly dimmer. In the case of the Lifx, you're given the option of adding in white light on top of the colored light. Pick a color like green and dial it up to 50 percent, and you'll get pure green light -- anything higher than 50 percent will begin adding in the white diodes.

The result is that you get a full spectrum of ""tinted"" light to play with, which brings the bulb's colors up into the same range of brightness that you'll get with pure white. That's an interesting trick that you won't see with the Philips or  Tabu Lumen  bulbs, and one that makes those colors slightly less of a party night novelty. Those tinted tones actually look downright good when coupled with the right home decor.

Like most LEDs that claim equivalency with 75-watt incandescents, the Lifx is bigger and heavier than other bulbs, weighing in at 10.4 ounces. That bulk comes from the additional heat sinks necessary to regulate the heat from those extra diodes (the Lifx has almost three times as many diodes as a Philips Hue bulb does). Given the weight and size, it isn't an ideal bulb for small lamps. It also runs a bit hot for an LED, so you definitely won't want to use it in an enclosed fixture.



The Lifx will light up as soon as you screw it in and turn on your lamp, but to control your bulb you'll need to download the Lifx app, available now for Android and iOS devices. The Lifx team has demonstrated the app controlling 50 lights at once, so you'll have no problem managing multiple bulbs. We kept it a little simpler with out setup, testing out just a few bulbs in tandem.

As soon as you open the app, it walks you through the pairing process, which is about as easy and straightforward as it gets. When you first turn a Lifx bulb on, it broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal. Join this signal as you would any other Wi-Fi network, then return to the Lifx app and jump back to your home network. That's it.

The process took me about a minute, and was even easier than my experience pairing other devices that use a similar, Wi-Fi based approach, like  Belkin WeMo Switches . Heads up, though: the bulbs are only as secure as your Wi-Fi password. Anyone who has access to your home network can download the Lifx app and have access to your lights, too.

Once your bulbs are synced up with your home network, you'll be able to control them from your phone or tablet. After spending more time with the bulbs, I've encountered the occasional quirk and hiccup -- moreso than I've seen with Philips Hue. Still, I've never encountered anything that couldn't be solved with a little bit of fiddling, or by restarting the app.

Quirks aside, the app gets a lot of things right. The interface for selecting specific colors is especially well-designed. Instead of moving a tiny selector around a wide spectrum of colors (the approach that Philips and Tabu take), you'll simply rotate the spectrum itself. Tap a color, and it'll automatically rotate to the top.

In other apps, where you drag the selector around, your finger inevitably ends up covering the part of the spectrum that you're trying to see, and that makes hitting a precise shade a tedious trial-and-error process. There are no such headaches with Lifx. It's a subtle difference, but one that makes for a patently better user experience with the product's core function: changing colors.

Lifx offers a separate color wheel for white light tones, which range from orangey, warm white shades to hot, bluish-white variations on daylight. This is similar to the dedicated white-light spectrum that Philips offers directly above its full color spectrum. Again, rotating a wheel is a lot easier than navigating an ocean of pixels with your fingertip blocking the view.

In the center of the Lifx color wheel, you'll find a dial that dims the light up and down. As said earlier, in color mode, anything above 50 percent brightness will start adding white light to the color you've selected.

This definitely makes for brighter light, but it also decreases the saturation of the shade. For the types of bold, vivid colors you'd want from a party light, you'll want to stay at 50 percent. For a subtler (and perhaps more practical) color effect, go ahead and dial it up towards 100 percent.

Beyond color and white mode, you'll have access to a few basic Effects like a press-to-strobe mode and a candle-mimicking mode. Gone, however, are the Scenes of Lifx 1.0, which allowed you to save a certain set of colors and brightness levels, then return to it with just a tap. The Lifx team claims that this was one of the least-used features in the app, so they replaced it with a tab dubbed ""Smarts.""

As of now, these Smarts are two-fold. First, you get a selection of different Themes to play with. These themes are really just small thumbnail images of things like sunsets, mixed berries, and a crashing wave. Select one of them, and your lights will each randomly select a color from the image. There's a rainbow-esque theme that essentially works as a crapshoot -- other, more monochromatic themes offer effects that are a little more focused.

Below the Themes, you'll find a Services section that lists the bulb's third-party integrations. As of now, there are just three: the  Nest Learning Thermostat , the  Nest Protect Smoke Detector , and  IFTTT . Tapping any of the three options will send you to pairing instructions to help get you started.

I was a little curious as to why the Lifx team would get rid of its Scenes outright -- as it stood, the feature was about as close as the app got to any sort of scheduling functionality, one of its most head-scratching omissions. Since originally publishing this review, Lifx added a neat feature where you can drag your finger over a bulb's name and quickly set it to fade off over a specific period of time, but still, not any sort of full-fledged scheduling mechanism. Getting rid of the Scenes seems like a big step backward, even if the Lifx team says no one was using them.

The answer here is the new Lifx IFTTT channel, to which the bulb essentially outsources much of its missing functionality. With IFTTT's ""if-this-then-that"" style recipes, you can set your Lifx bulbs to come on at specific times, or when an IFTTT-compatible motion detector gets triggered, or when somebody mentions you in a tweet. It's a pretty colossal upgrade, and I'm kind of puzzled it took Lifx this long to make it happen.

Regardless, the important thing is that it's here now, and it's quite good. You have a good number of Lifx-based IFTTT Actions to choose from (the ""then-thats"" of your recipes) -- these include turning the bulb on or off, and also changing to a specific color. You can even tell the bulb to ""breathe"" out a series of light pulses in whatever color you like, perfect for an ambient notification. If you want three red pulses whenever the boss emails, it's easy to set up.



One caveat, though: you'll need to upgrade your bulb's firmware before you'll be able to take advantage of the new features. To do so, you'll need to download a separate ""Lifx Updater"" app, then follow its instructions.

The process is fairly painless, although it took me about 90 minutes and roughly 30 percent of my phone's battery to get through it. Once you're done, you'll be able to sync your bulbs up with the long-awaited Lifx Cloud, which is the key to unlocking all of the new features and integrations.

Smarts aside, we can't forget about the Lifx's core functionality. If you're paying $99 for a color-changing bulb, you're going to want those colors to be bold, vivid and accurate.

So, how well does the Lifx perform in terms of color quality? The answer is that it does an admirable job. I'd call it more accurate with its colors than the Philips Hue, which struggles with green, but not quite as accurate as the Lumen LED, which does the best job with blue, in spite of being a simpler, dimmer smart bulb.

However, like the Philips Hue, the Lifx has a distinct edge over the Lumen LED in terms of its natural tones. Both offer full spectrums of white light to choose from, while the Lumen LED only offers a single, 2,700K tone as a default.  	 When we put the Philips Hue to the test, we found that its range of natural light fell almost perfectly in line with what you'll get from incandescent lights of various color temperatures.

We got the same result when we put the Lifx through the same test. No matter which one of the Lifx app's 16 white light tones we selected, the color plotted perfectly along the same path that incandescents travel. That tells us that in terms of color, the Lifx is just as accurate a replacement for incandescent lighting as the Philips Hue is, and that's a legitimate selling point for each bulb.

For a closer look at our comparison shots, be sure and check out  	 our full gallery for the complete rundown.

As multicolor LEDs go, the Lifx is probably the best-looking one that I've seen, and certainly the brightest. With dozens of diodes and 1,000 lumens to its name, it's a muscular bulb, capable of producing bright, vivid light of any color you want. Like the  	 Philips Hue LED , it offers both a full color spectrum and a natural light spectrum, but by allowing you to combine the two simply by dialing a color's brightness up from 50 to 100 percent, it essentially offers you a third spectrum of tinted white light to play with -- and that makes a lot of sense for more practical household lighting scenarios.

Last year, I stopped short of recommending Lifx due to the key features that weren't in the app, most notably scheduling and automation capability. They still aren't there, which is less than reassuring, but the addition of a Lifx IFTTT channel at least makes that sort of functionality possible. That, coupled with the Nest integration, makes Lifx a dramatically more functional bulb than it was at launch, and it's a lot easier to justify spending $99 on it as a result."
Tabu LuMini LED review:|"

Tabu's LuMini LED is a pint-size follow-up to last year's color-changer, the  	 Lumen LED . We got a close look at it when we were at CES in January, and now, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, the LuMini is set to begin taking orders next week. Like its predecessor, it connects with your smartphone over Bluetooth 4.0, allowing you to change the color of your light on demand.

Color-shifting party tricks aside, the real headline here is the price. At $35 per bulb and usable straight out of the box, the LuMini costs just half of what you'll pay for the Lumen LED, and far,  	far less than what you'll spend to get set up with a  Philips Hue Starter Kit . While not as powerful as either of those options, the LuMini provides legitimate color-changing charm -- and it does so without breaking the bank.

The LuMini features a short, cylindrical, pencil eraser of a bulb that sits atop a white plastic body. As LEDs go, it blends in with the crowd a little more than its heavier, aluminum-bodied predecessor, the Lumen LED. With the generally unorthodox designs of LEDs becoming more and more orthodox, it's hard to tell that much is special about this little light from looks alone.

This can't be said once the light is actually flipped on, though. Connecting your bulb to the app is a quick and nearly automatic process, and once you're set up, you'll be treated to a wide array of vivid colors. Those come thanks to the LuMini's RGB diodes, the same ones we saw in the Lumen LED. The Lumen LED's white diodes, however, are notably absent in the LuMini. Tabu got rid of them with the smaller design, and without them, the LuMini is almost incapable of mimicking natural, incandescent-style tones.

Changing among colors is as easy as swiping your fingertip around on a color wheel. That color wheel can feel a little cramped on a phone screen, though. Hitting the boldest shades of each color is simple enough, but landing on the perfect, subtle mix of purple and red might take a little bit of fiddling before you feel satisfied.

For convenience, you'll be able to add up to six bulbs into a single group, and then control them all at once. I tried this out with a LuMini and a Lumen LED, and it worked great, with minimal lag separating the two as I darted my finger back and forth on the color wheel.

Like the Lumen LED before it, the LuMini uses Bluetooth 4.0 to connect with your device, so iOS users will need something newer than an iPhone 4 or an iPad 2 in order to control it. There's an Android app as well, but you'll want to be sure that your device uses both Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.3 (the Samsung Galaxy S4, the Nexus 7, and the Note 3 would all work).

Android users might want to consider holding out, though, as the Lumen's Android app is still playing catch-up with the iOS version. Key features, including the music sync mode, are notably absent, which is a definite disappointment.

Despite the LuMini's smaller size, Tabu hasn't compromised much, if anything, in terms of smarts. As you play with Tabu's app, you'll find that you can control the LuMini in all of the same ways that you're able to control the Lumen LED. There's a proximity sensor that automatically turns your light on to a specific color whenever the bulb detects your phone within range, along with four color cycling presets, a mode for scheduling the light to fade on in the mornings, an incoming call alert, and a music sync mode -- exactly the same options you'll get with the Lumen LED.

The proximity sensor worked like a charm in my tests, though you'll need to keep the app running in the background. I also appreciated the wake-up mode, which will gradually turn the light on at a time of your choice. I just wish Tabu had taken things a bit further and offered full scheduling, with off times as well. As it stands, the timed controls of the LuMini and the Lumen LED still feel underdeveloped, especially compared with brainier bulbs like Philips Hue LEDs and even non-color-changing smart options like the  	 Connected by TCP Wireless LED Kit .

The LuMini does manage to set itself apart with its music sync mode. Philips Hue still doesn't offer this directly through the Hue app, choosing instead to leave music syncing to  	third-party developers. Tabu's music syncing, on the other hand, is a marquee feature of the app, which feels appropriate given the bulb's obvious tilt toward fun and festivities.

The controls are a little simpler than I'd like -- you'll select a song from your device's library (or from an existing playlist), and the the light will begin flashing in rhythm with the music as best as it can, gradually shifting through a five-shade color cycle that you can customize with tones of your choice.

Music sync obviously works better with songs that have fairly obvious beats for the LuMini to catch onto, but I was still impressed with how well the bulb matched up to faster, more complicated rhythms. Plus, it was kind of fun going through my favorite songs and figuring out which ones synced up the best.

Not all of LuMini's smart features impressed me. The four cycles (two speeds of a strobing ""disco mode,"" along with two more calming cycles) were nice to have, but I hated that I couldn't customize them, or create my own preset. And that feature that flashes the light when you've got an incoming call? I couldn't get that to work at all.

The LuMini boasts vivid, accurate colors, just like the Lumen LED does. Whether it's magenta, chartreuse, or cerulean colored light that you're looking for, the LuMini can handle it. This gives it an edge over Philips Hue LEDs, which have overpowering yellow diodes, weak blue diodes, and no green diodes at all -- all of which contribute to compromised color quality in certain parts of the spectrum.

This distinction is most evident when you start comparing shades of green. The LuMini is fully capable of putting out a wide array of green tones, which is what you'd expect from an RGB bulb with dedicated, pure green diodes. The Hue LEDs, on the other hand, have to get to green by mixing blue and yellow. Since the blue diodes aren't nearly strong enough to match what the yellow diodes put out, the Hues throw a little bit of red into the mix, too. As a result, the closest thing to pure green that a Hue LED can muster is a yellowy, tennis-ball-toned shade that just barely qualifies as green at all.

Things get interesting when you compare blue shades, as well. The Lumen and LuMini LEDs do a great job at producing a deep, rich blue, while the Philips Hue comes across as more purple, or at least indigo. This is thanks again to those weak blue diodes. When you select blue light, Philips once again turns the red diodes on as well to give the light a brightness boost, but, again,  this compromises the trueness of the blue. Tabu's bulbs don't suffer from this problem.

Another interesting takeaway from the color comparisons is that the LuMini holds its own against the larger Lumen LED in terms of brightness. Yes, it's a dimmer bulb, which is to be expected, but not as noticeably so as I had expected.

This is due in part to the fact that the majority of the Lumen LED's brightness comes from those white diodes that allow it to replicate incandescent light. For colored light -- the light that we're comparing here -- it isn't using those diodes, and relies instead on a set of RGB diodes that aren't much different from what's packed into the LuMini. In terms of color brightness, the Lumen still comes out on top across the board, but it's a lot closer than you probably think.

Of course, the one caveat here is natural light, which the LuMini is terrible at. Using the color wheel to try and come up with something similar to the Lumen LED's default warm white, 2,700K tone, the best I got with the LuMini was a dim, ugly, brownish play on orange. The LuMini's default tone, a dim take on bluish white light, isn't a whole lot better, or a whole lot brighter.

With the LuMini, you'll want to stick to its strength: bold colors. If natural tones of soft white, warm white, or daylight are important to you in a color-changing LED, then you'll probably want to strongly consider splurging on a Philips Hue set, as  	 those bulbs do a wonderful job with natural tones.

The LuMini offers the same vivid, accurate colors and the same ease of use as last year's  	 Lumen LED . The Lumen app has also been upgraded to a slightly more fleshed out and feature-rich experience. Given all of this, I think Tabu might have a big winner here. At $35 -- half of what the Lumen LED costs -- the LuMini just makes sense as the kind of fun, frivolous novelty splurge that you don't have to feel all that guilty about. If I bought a $200 smart bulb set and didn't like it, I'd feel like an idiot. If I bought the LuMini and didn't like it, I'd shrug it off.

The LuMini isn't a perfect bulb, but at this price, it doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to be fun -- and it is. It's really as simple as that."
Philips shines a light on aesthetics with the new Clear LED (hands-on)|"

The frosted bulbs on today's LEDs aren't just there for softer light -- they also hide the unsightly hardware inside. But what if you're a fan of the exposed bulb aesthetic, and looking for a worthy replacement for those translucent incandescents lining your bathroom mirror?

Philips thinks it has just the thing with its new Clear LED, a 40W replacement bulb which the Dutch company promises will mimic the ""elegant shape and sparkling light"" of traditional incandescents. With its A60 shape, clear glass bulb, and inconspicuous heat sinks, this LED is designed to strike a more familiar tone with consumers than its often irregular-looking competition.

Like Philips' standard 40W replacement LED, the Philips Clear puts out 470 lumens at a color temperature of 2,700 K, claims full dimmability and omnidirectionality, and promises a lifespan of 25,000 hours. The Philips Clear is the slightly more efficient bulb, though, drawing 6 watts as opposed to 8 from the standard Philips LED. This puts it right in line with the Cree 40W replacement LED, which puts out 450 lumens at 2,700 K using 6 watts.

Still, it's the bulb's traditional appearance and ""sparkling"" light quality that Philips is focusing on, here -- not comparative performance claims. It isn't the first time Philips has marketed an LED's design as its chief selling point. The recently released Philips SlimStyle LED has an eyebrow-raising, flattened design that distributes the diodes around the perimeter of the bulb (if you can even call it a bulb).

The Philips Clear doesn't use quite as unusual an approach, but it does signal that manufacturers are starting to look beyond the usual performance claims and comparisons with incandescents when marketing their bulbs. Philips seems to think that bulb aesthetics might be the next LED battleground, while manufacturers like Cree and GE appear to be focusing more on  color quality.

At 2,700 K, the Philips Clear puts out the same, warm light as other LEDs with similar color temperatures. Like many consumers, I tend to prefer warmer tones from my lights, but with the Philips Clear, I wonder if a hotter, whiter color temperature would have done a better job of showing off the diamond-esque quality of the bulb's interior. Hot, white color temperatures also tend to work well in bathroom lights, which seems like an obvious place to put an exposed bulb like this to work.

Another important point of consideration as far as aesthetics are concerned is dimmability, and  like the standard line of Philips LEDs, the Philips Clear performs well in this regard. I was able to dim it using in-wall Lutron and Leviton dimmers designed for LEDs, along with a plain, inexpensive rotary model that's rated for incandescent use only.

There wasn't any buzzing that I could hear as I dimmed up and down on any of the switches -- though I did see a very noticeable flicker at certain points on the rotary dial. Still, a very good result that's reassuring for anyone looking to dim this light down low.

The Philips Clear LED is expected to arrive at European retailers sometime this summer, with a US rollout coming by the year's end. Philips isn't sharing the bulb's cost just yet, but with the SlimStyle selling for less than $10 (£6) and the Cree 40W replacement selling for less than $5 (£3), I'd expect the Clear to land somewhere in that ballpark."
Iris Home Management System review:|"

Most of today's home automation options come in the form of old-guard systems like  Insteon  or crowdfunded Internet startups like  SmartThings . The Iris Home Management System, a descendant of the UK-based AlertMe, is a little bit different, as it has the full backing of US retail giant Lowe's. You can order Iris online, or pick it up from one of the hundreds of Lowe's across the country that showcase the system, along with the multitude of compatible Z-Wave switches and sensors you can add to it.

As a system capable of working with such a wide range of devices, and with multiple kits available starting at just $179, Iris shows a lot of promise. It's a flexible system, too -- use it for home security, use it to track and lower your energy costs, or just use it for simple conveniences like motion activated lighting and smart lock controls. Whatever your automation needs, Iris should be able to get the job done.

However, that multifunctionality doesn't come without a price. In the case of Iris, that price is $9.99 a month, which is what you'll need to pay to unlock the full potential of your setup. You can go fee-free, but you'll be giving up the ability to set rules, schedules, and preset modes for your devices, along with countless other key features that would justify using Iris in the first place.

While not totally unreasonable (Iris starts you out with two months of full service for free), the fees are still a little hard to swallow given that worthy competitors like Insteon and SmartThings don't charge a thing. If you need a system that's capable of meeting several different home automation needs all at once, Iris probably deserves your consideration. For more focused automation needs, you can find a system that fits better into your home -- and into your budget.

With most home automation systems, the variety of starter kits available won't be terribly different from one another -- at least not in terms of functionality. You'll likely get extra sensors with certain options, or maybe the addition of a cool peripheral accessory, like a camera, but the way you'll use your system and the things that you'll use it for will remain largely the same.

This isn't the case with Iris. The $179 Safe and Secure Kit offers a motion detector, entry sensors, and an alarm control keypad, while the equally priced Care and Comfort Kit offers a smart plug module and a connected thermostat. As the names suggest, the former is intended for security-minded consumers, while the latter is intended more for budding hobbyists and for those looking for a higher level of convenience at home. The only common denominator between the two is that they both come with the Iris Hub used to control every Iris system. Your third option is to go with the $299 Smart Kit, which combines the other two options and adds in a range extender.

No matter which kit you go with, you'll have the option of adding additional sensors and devices to your system on a piece-by-piece basis, most of which are reasonably priced. These device options range from wireless IP cameras to leak detectors, smoke alarms, and everything in between. Your options also include many third-party smart-home products, things like  Schlage deadbolts  and  Honeywell thermostats .

If you want to automate it, chances are good that Iris can handle it, as both its Web site and app are designed to fully accommodate just about every smart-home scenario imaginable. In fact, Iris boasts compatibility with a greater number of sensor categories than any other system we've tested, making it a more expandable option than something like SmartThings or even another fee-based system like  Nexia Home Intelligence .

This is one of the system's true selling points, but it gives the Web site and app you'll use to control Iris a cluttered, confusing appearance. In both cases, the home screen has grayed-out sections for each type of device that Iris is capable of handling. Add a device to your system, and you'll activate that section. Unless you go hog wild with your setup, you probably won't be needing a majority of these sections -- and yet they remain locked into the home screens. In the case of the Web site, each one features a hyperlink that takes you to the online Iris Store so you can buy the associated device. That's a nice feature for shopaholics, but for the average user, it's as if Iris plastered cheap, repetitive ads all over your home screen.

Still, the Web site has a lot of features built into it, certainly more so than the app, which will really only let you arm or disarm your alarm, change between system presets (or Modes), or check device status. You won't be able to create or edit any automation rules (Iris refers to them as ""Magic""), and the only system setting you'll be able to tweak is whether or not you need a PIN to open the app.

The Web site, on the other hand, features plenty of system settings, but the problem is that they're scattered about the site. There's no dedicated section for them. If you want to tweak the way your entry sensors work, you'll have to check the ""Alarm Configuration"" -- unless you want the system to chime whenever the door opens: in that case, you'll need to go to the Devices section of the site (not the Devices subsection of the Alarm section, mind you), then click the Manage button next to your entry sensor. If all of that seems confusing, it's because it is.

Usability quirks aside, the Iris system works well, and it isn't terribly difficult to install. It isn't quite as idiot-proof as some of the other systems that we've looked at, but I was still able to get everything up and running in under an hour. After plugging in the Hub, the Iris Web site will walk you through the setup process device by device. Each system component that I tested paired with the Hub mere seconds after putting the batteries in -- from there, it's simply a matter of choosing where to place them.

Once you've got everything where you want it, you'll find that Iris is a reliable performer. In my tests, it never failed to work in the way that I had programmed it to work. This includes the aforementioned ""Magic"" rules that you'll create to form if/then relationships between your devices. I appreciated that the Iris Web site provided me with a lengthy, well-organized list of potential rules I could set up, with options like ""when a sensor is activated, then control a device."" Simply activate the rule, then customize how it works (which sensor, which device, etc.). Reading over the different options sparked my creativity, giving me plenty of ideas about new ways of controlling my system and making it more convenient. Best of all, each one that I tried worked perfectly.

But doing what you're supposed to do isn't the same thing as doing it well. This much is evident with the Iris Alarm Keypad. It does what it promises, but that doesn't mean it's great at it. Unlike the SimpliSafe keypad, there isn't a screen on the thing, so you won't receive any feedback from your alarm that doesn't come in the form of beeps. What's worse, those beeps aren't nearly loud enough when it really counts: when the alarm is actually going off. The thing sounds a bit like a slightly aggressive alarm clock -- maybe it would be enough to scare off a skittish intruder, but I doubt it'd spur the neighbors to call the police.

The keypad isn't as responsive as I'd like, either. If it isn't in the same room as the hub, it'll lag a little bit when you try and put your code in. I'd often find myself entering my code three or four times before the signal would finally go through. This was especially flustering when I was trying to cancel a pending alarm. Arming and disarming the system through the smartphone app worked much better, and there's an optional keychain fob accessory that you can use as well, but still, it's disappointing that the keypad -- a default component of the Safe and Secure Kit -- doesn't work as well as it ought to.

All of this is to say that if you're looking for a system designed to secure your home, I think that you've got better options. For a slightly higher monthly fee,  SimpliSafe  will give you a system that includes live monitoring, a cellular backup, and countless other features that give it a distinct edge. If live monitoring isn't important to you, then you can turn to a system like  iSmartAlarm  or  Viper Home , both of which do most of the same things as Iris, but do so without charging you a monthly fee.

It's hard not to be impressed with the scope of Iris' coverage. No matter what specific subsection of home automation interests you, Iris will have you covered, and this is especially nice if you're a smart-home multitasker with a variety of uses in mind for your system. I also appreciated some of Iris' unique features, things like ""Care,"" which is a mode within Iris designed specifically for caregivers and family members of the elderly.

The problem is that Iris just doesn't seem focused enough. It's a wide system, but not a particularly deep one. It does a lot of things, but it isn't the best at any of those things. Users who want a little bit of everything from their system will undoubtedly appreciate the wide approach that Iris employs, but I think that most consumers have at least one specific, primary function in mind for their home automation system, and that's where you want depth. That's where you want the best system for the job. As well-rounded a system as it is, there just aren't a lot of situations where Iris can say it's the best system for the job -- not in terms of performance, and not in terms of value, either."
Stand up or sit down with the PowerUp Series II desk (hands-on)|"



In today's always-on, super-connected workplace it's harder than ever to get out of that chair and simply take a break. Worse, sitting for hours at a stretch not only doesn't burn many calories, it might even be a serious health risk. The problem is standing all day at the office is a big commitment and frankly it's a relief to kick your feet up once in a while. Don't worry though, the $899 UpDesk PowerUps Series II motorized desk gives you the option to sit when you want and stand when you should.

Design and features Made by UpDesk which is based in Nashville, Tenn., the $899 PowerUps is certainly not an impulse buy. That said, this desk is no ordinary piece of office furniture. The PowerUps' two metal legs actually contain electric motors which raise or lower the desk's flat surface on command. Spanning a range of 25.5 inches to 50.5 inches, the PowerUps' height accommodates all degrees sitting and standing positions.

A control panel complete with a digital LED readout is located on the desk's right, bottom lip. The panel houses arrow buttons for raising and lowering the desk manually while the current height is listed in inches on the display. The feature I like best though is how you can save up to three different height values and map them to buttons on the control panel. For instance I was able to set personalized heights for sitting, standing, and one perfect for afternoon coffee time (slightly taller than standing mode).

UpDesk says that the twin motors of the PowerUp Series II can support up to 300 pounds. That'll cover the weight of normal office equipment just fine, but you might want to think twice about dropping old CRT monitors, console-style TVs, or engine blocks on the thing. Thankfully the desk uses a standard two-prong plug that connects to 120V AC outlets. There's also a cable management channel for guiding cords and reducing clutter (placed on the underside).

The basic model of the PowerUp, the small size (48x30 inches) I tested, starts at $899, but UpDesk sells a medium (60x30 inches) and large (72x30 inches) version for $949 and $999, respectively. You also have color options of Maple (shown here), Mahogany, Black, and Orange (medium size only, for $949).

Outlook I can say that I've definitely enjoyed the few weeks I've spent working with the UpDesk PowerUp Series II. Of course I'm not exactly sure if I'm experiencing powerful health benefits, though I have been standing much more than I am used to. I also can't deny that the quality of the desk itself is high and feels sturdier than my officially issued work surface.

To be entirely truthful, the PowerUp doesn't match the sleek modern styling of the Stir Kinetic Desk. Still, the Stir costs a whopping $3,890 and is packed with sophisticated body-sensing electronics plus an embedded touch screen. If you're looking for a complete, adjustable, and motorized standing desk solution, however, the PowerUp Series II beats the pants off cheap, static solutions from Ikea and the like."
Philips announces Energy Star certified 75- and 100-watt replacement LEDs|"



If you've been waiting for brighter and more affordable options in the LED aisle, then you're in luck.

Today, Philips announced Energy Star certification for their second-generation 75- and 100-watt replacement LEDs, along with exclusive discounts on both bulbs at Home Depots nationwide. Combined with the regional utility rebates that come with Energy Star certification, this means that consumers in some parts of the country will be able to purchase the 75-watt replacement for less than $10, with the 100-watt replacement going for just under $15. For the rest of us, the bulbs will retail for $19.97 and $24.97, respectively.

Both bulbs give off an impressive amount of light. The 75-watt replacement glows at 1,220 lumens, which is noticeably brighter than the 1,125 lumens or so that you'll get from a common 75-watt incandescent. As for Philips' 100-watt replacement LED, it gives off 1,680 lumens, an even more noticeable bump in brightness from the 1,500 lumens that a comparable 100-watt incandescent will put out.

Aside from the differences in price and brightness, there's not much separating the two bulbs from one another. Each one glows at a warm, soft white color temperature of 2,700K, and like most LEDs these days, both are rated to last 25,000 hours (just under 23 years at three hours a day). Both bulbs use a common A19 base, so you can expect them to fit into most standard household lamps and light fixtures.

The 75-watt replacement uses 15 watts, while the 100-watt replacement uses 19. This gives the 75-watt replacement an efficiency rating of 81.33 lumens/watt, with an even more impressive 88.42 lumens/watt for the 100-watt replacement. Compare that with the traditional 15 lumens/watt that you get from incandescent bulbs, and you can begin to see why Energy Star is on board with these LEDs.

Compare the two of them with Philips' own 60-watt replacement LED, however, and you'll notice a slightly different design, with the higher wattage bulbs separated into three sections for more efficient heat dissipation. I was curious to see if this design would lead to any issues with the omnidirectionality of the bulbs' light output, like the slight issue we saw with Philips' SlimStyle LED. In our light box, however, all we saw was bright, evenly dispersed light.

Looking at the bulbs, you'll also notice that both are noticeably longer than Philips' lower-wattage bulbs. If you want to use them in a fixture that doesn't offer a lot of vertical clearance, you may want to break out the measuring tape first.

I was also curious to see how Philips' LEDs would compare with some of the competition, particularly the Cree 75-watt replacement LED. Like the Philips 75-watt replacement LED, Cree's bulb can be found for $19.97 at Home Depot, but unlike Philips, it hasn't received Energy Star certification yet. Cree submitted that bulb for certification in December, and with a testing process that takes three to four months, it  should be hearing back sometime soon. With efficiency and lifespan stats similar to the Cree 60-watt replacement LED, which is Energy Star certified, Cree expects their 75-watt replacement to follow suit. For now though, Philips has the pricing edge in those regions that offer utility rebates.

As for the how the two bulbs perform, both are dimmable, and both claim a color temperature of 2,700K -- though Cree's take on 2,700K is a bit more yellow than Philips'. Also, the Philips LED is clearly the brighter of the two bulbs, which makes sense given that it claims 1,220 lumens compared to Cree's 1,100. Cree's bulb uses 13.5 watts while the Philips LED uses 15, so the Cree bulb will cost slightly less to use in the long run. Cree can also claim the longer warranty, with 10 years of coverage compared to 5 from Philips.

Philips 75- and 100-watt replacement LEDs are available now at Home Depot's newly discounted prices both in-store and online."
Staples Connect review:|"

There's little doubt that the popularity of ""smart home"" products is surging. Connected devices both large and small were everywhere at CES this year, and with Google buying Nest recently, it's clear that the titans of tech are paying attention.

But with all of these new devices comes a Babel-esque smattering of networking protocols -- the ""languages"" they use to receive and transmit data. Some speak to your router over Wi-Fi, others speak to your tablet over Bluetooth. Kwikset, Yale and Schlage make smart deadbolts that relay information using Z-Wave, while Philips Hue bulbs are fluent in ZigBee. There's Insteon's network, the Clear Connect protocol spoken by Lutron products, and countless other proprietary languages to keep track of. Try using multiple devices from different manufacturers and it'll become clear: a smart house divided cannot stand.

Enter Staples Connect, a system that promises to unite your devices behind a single hub and a single app capable of controlling all of them. With fluency in multiple protocols and partnerships with some of the most popular connected-device manufacturers, the smart-home singularity that Staples is offering seems enticing -- especially given that its $99 hub is $200 cheaper than the Revolv, a rival hub that offers exactly the same thing.

So, does Staples Connect deliver? The answer is yes -- to an extent. The system is simple enough to set up and use, and it works reliably. Plus, with key product partners like Honeywell, Philips, and GE, along with a hardware partnership with Linksys, Staples Connect is well positioned for future growth. We saw as much at CES, when Staples and Zonoff, its platform provider, announced new partnerships with Goji, Koubachi, and Radio Thermostat, along with upcoming support for Insteon, Bluetooth, and ZigBee.

However, the functionality that the Staples Connect ecosystem offers for each compatible device isn't always deep enough to justify replacing the existing app outright. What's more, with certain products, you'll still need to plug a separate control device into your router. The dream is total unification -- one hub, one app -- and the software in Staples Connect isn't deep enough to bring us there.

Of course, these are issues that every would-be master hub is currently facing, and as such, it might be best to wait before committing to anything. That said, if you need something now, Staples Connect is robust enough -- and affordable enough -- to justify the purchase.

Design and features

The Staples Connect hub isn't much to look at. Its boring, plain-white plastic body doesn't have any of the fun, futuristic design touches that you'll see in a product like the Revolv, and it lacks some of the Revolv's functional touches, too. For instance, while you can place the Revolv wherever you like, the Staples Connect Hub will need to remain plugged into your router at all times, and it can't pair with your phone simply by flashing a light at it, either.

Still, the Staples Connect hub is a successfully simple device. After plugging it in, you'll never need to mess with it again -- just download the free app to your Android or iOS device or pull up the Web interface to get started. In terms of design, Staples' app again falls a bit short of Revolv's, which offers a more stylish user interface as well as useful built-in features like geofencing -- but it still gets the job done.

The Staples app will walk you through the the initial setup process in just a few minutes. After everything's plugged in, you'll need to wait for a few lights to turn blue, then enter the hub's serial number into the app. That's it. From there, it's simply a matter of connecting your devices, which is equally pain-free. Through the app's device manager, you'll tell the system which specific device you're adding, then follow simple pairing instructions specific to that device. For my tests, I added Philips Hue bulbs, a Yale smart lock, a GE appliance control module, and Lutron light dimmers. I didn't have difficulty with any of them.

This is where those product partnerships come into play. Staples is forgoing the more open approach to third-party devices that we're seeing with Revolv as well as with systems like SmartThings, and choosing instead to focus only on integrating products made by manufacturers with whom it's able to form strong business partnerships. The upside to this approach is that using these products within the Staples ecosystem is a piece of cake. The downside is that you won't have much luck trying to integrate devices that aren't partnered with Staples, even if they use a protocol that Staples supports.

A good example of this is the Belkin WeMo line of products, which use Wi-Fi. The Staples Connect hub is perfectly capable of receiving Wi-Fi signals, so you might expect that it would be able to control WeMo devices. It can't, because Belkin isn't currently one of Staples Connect's partners. Belkin doesn't support formal integration with any platform provider, but that didn't stop Revolv from back-ending WeMo integration into its system all the same. Staples Connect could do the same thing if Staples wanted it to -- but it doesn't.

Performance and usability

As said before, getting up and running with Staples Connect is a breeze. Once you've got everything hooked up, you'll be all set to start automating. Staples calls its automations ""activities,"" and with a system capable of controlling hundreds of devices at once, you'll have room for plenty of them.

You'll choose between timed activities that occur -- you guessed it -- at a specific time of day, or triggered activities that happen on your command, or when certain conditions are met. I started my tests with a triggered activity labeled ""School Pride."" At the tap of a button on my smartphone app, the Philips Hue bulbs in our office would change to my alma mater's school colors. The hub would need to receive the signal from my smartphone over Wi-Fi, then send a Wi-Fi signal to the Philips bridge, telling it to send a ZigBee signal out to the bulbs, changing their color (yep, you still need the Philips bridge to use Hue bulbs with Staples Connect, at least for now). The activity worked like a charm each time, and never with any noticeable lag.

Next, I moved on to something a little more difficult: an activity involving two distinct protocols. After adding a Yale smart deadbolt to my system, I programmed the Hue bulbs to turn green whenever I unlocked the deadbolt and red whenever I locked it. Again, the activity worked perfectly, the lights changing almost instantly each time. I tried out some timed activities as well, with equally satisfying results.

One gripe, though: as of this writing, you can only create new activities from the iPad version of the app. iPhone and Android users can trigger existing activities, but will have to log on to the Web interface to add new ones. Zonoff tells me that an update to the iPhone app that includes support for activity creation is coming ""in the next week or two,"" and that users of all devices should expect updates on ""a pretty regular basis.""

Beyond the activities, you'll also have remote control of your devices within the app. If you want to unlock the deadbolt or change the color of the Hue bulbs, you're just a few taps away. My only complaint with these controls is that they're often a bit basic and not quite as extensive as you'd find in the device's native app or software. You won't be able to send your Hue bulbs into a preprogrammed party mode, for instance, and you won't be able to automate your deadbolt based on the specific user code that's being entered. For times like this, when you need more than a basic level of control, you'll probably find yourself back in the Philips Hue app, or punching settings directly into your lock. Consumers who expect a master hub to offer near-total control over their devices might find this a little bit disappointing.

Conclusion

Is Staples Connect the one device to rule them all? It could be at some point, but it isn't yet -- and neither is anything else. No system has locked down compatibility with enough products to claim a stranglehold on the market, and none of them offer anything near full, across-the-board functionality for everything in your system.

But Staples is off to a very solid start, with a strong variety of products, an easy-to-use app, and enough basic controls to merit early adoption. Its hardware partnership with Linksys is worth remembering, too, as we might be nearing a point where devices like these don't just plug into routers but replace them altogether. Most important is the price, which for most consumers will clearly be an easier sell than the $299 Revolv. Guessing exactly where the market is headed would be a gamble, but at $99, it's an affordable one."
Does the Switch Infinia LED outshine the competition? (hands-on)|"

Your LED options keep on expanding, with

new, forward-thinking designs

, an increasing number of

automatable smart lights

, and no shortage of bold claims about performance and longevity. In the end, however, the bulbs we've been most impressed with tend to be the ones from manufacturers willing to put their money where their mouth is by offering consumers long-term warranties. Cree's been a particular favorite of ours, as their variety of LED bulbs have all performed well in our tests, and all come packaged with a 10-year warranty.

But Cree might have some legitimate competition in Switch, a small Silicon Valley-based company founded by a team of engineers in 2007. At a price of $11.99 per bulb, the 60-watt replacement Switch Infinia LED is priced to compete with Cree's own 60-watt replacement, which costs about a buck more at $12.97. The two bulbs have quite a bit in common. Both are efficient enough to earn Energy Star certification, meaning that they'll cost a lot less if you live in a region that offers energy rebates. At 800 lumens and 2700K each, the bulbs offer a remarkably similar quality of light, and both are rated to last 25,000 hours (that's about 25 years if you run them for 3 hours a day.)

The biggest difference between the two comes with the warranty. Cree's got those 10 years of coverage -- but Switch warrants their Infinia LEDs for life. As long as you own one, they'll replace it free of charge if it fails, even past that projected 25-year lifespan.

There are other differences between the two as well. The Switch Infinia LED is a weighty bulb, coming in at 6 ounces -- the Cree LED weighs less than 4. The designs are also noticeably different, with a slightly bulky ring of heat sinks around the neck of the Cree bulb that you won't find on the Switch.

Switch claims that the lack of conspicuous heat sinks is thanks to the ""LQD Cooling System"" that bathes the Infinia's chips in a specially formulated liquid, allowing heat to dissipate evenly through the glass. According to Switch, this liquid-cooled design makes for 40 percent better thermal performance than standard, air-cooled LEDs. Sure enough, the Infinia did seem noticeably cooler to the touch than the Cree bulb after a few minutes of use. Switch also claims that their cooler-running bulb is safe for use in all recessed and enclosed lighting setups, where excess heat can sometimes cause trouble for electrical components.

The Switch Infinia LED comes in a 60-watt replacement variety as well as a 40-watt replacement variety. Both are available in select retailers nationwide, as well as online through Amazon and HomeDepot.com."
Bluetooth-enabled Lumen Mini lights up Vegas|"



Tabu, the folks behind the Lumen bulb, have added a new product to their LED offerings. It's called the Lumen Mini, and as you probably guessed, it's significantly smaller than the original. This compact little bulb is bluetooth-enabled and it's coming to Kickstarter later this month.

Aside from size, this bulb has a couple of other distinguishing characteristics. First, it's a color LED bulb, so you'll be disappointed if you're expecting the same ""warm white"" option offered on the original Lumen. That makes the Mini a bit more of a mood light and a bit less of a continuous use light. Of course, you can use it however you like, but it really is designed for a party atmosphere. Just download the free Android or iOS app and you can change the color to suit the specific atmosphere you want to create.

The Lumen Mini is available in two different bases; the E27 and the smaller E14. That makes it a bit more versatile if your fixtures support different socket sizes. Look for this LED on Kickstarter in late January -- it's expected to retail for $30."
Smart LED Bulbs join Belkin's WeMo lineup|"

Belkin is adding LED bulbs to their rapidly expanding WeMo family of smart devices, the company announced today at CES.

The Belkin WeMo Smart LED Bulb is an 800 lumen 60-watt replacement that you'll be able to control remotely on Android and iOS devices using the free WeMo app. Each bulb features a warm white color temperature of 3000K along with a lifespan of 25,000 hours. You'll be able to automate the bulbs to turn on and off at certain times, or trigger them with another WeMo device, like a motion detector.

Like the light switches and plug-in modules that already bear the WeMo name, the WeMo Smart LED Bulbs will be fully compatible with the free web service IFTTT, which allows them to be triggered using nifty things like iOS location and Foursquare check-ins.

Unlike other WeMo devices, however, you'll need a separate accessory -- the ""WeMo Link"" plug-in hub -- in order to use them. That means you can't simply buy a $39 bulb and start automating it right out of the box -- you'll need to purchase the two-bulb WeMo LED Lighting Starter Set for $129, which comes with the WeMo Link.

Still, the only other bulb that's directly automatable through IFTTT is the Philips Hue, with a starter kit that costs $199. If you're interested in IFTTT-controlled lighting (and not so interested in bulbs that change colors on demand), then the Belkin bulb is probably pretty intriguing. If IFTTT doesn't tempt you, and simple automations will do just fine, then you'll probably want to consider the Connected by TCP Wireless LED Lighting Kit, which offers three automatable LEDs, yet costs $20 less than Belkin's kit."
The Belkin WeMo Maker Kit makes its debut|"

The $80 Belkin WeMo Maker Kit, available for preorder starting today, was first announced at CES earlier this year. A bit of a departure from the rest of Belkin's home automation line, the Maker Kit isn't meant for DIY beginners.

Instead, it lets folks with significant electrical know-how monitor and control pretty much any low-voltage device -- from garage door openers to sprinkler systems, motors and more --  remotely. This gives more advanced tinkerers the tools they need to turn basic DC switch-powered products into smart home products that you can schedule and turn on or off on demand straight from Belkin's WeMo Android or iOS app.

In addition to wiring into low voltage devices, you can also use the WeMo Maker to keep an eye on 5V DC sensors on your compatible device. This includes light, motion, moisture, temperature, flame and carbon monoxide detectors so you can always see what's going on at home.

The WeMo Maker also works alongside other WeMo products and integrates with IFTTT for triggered recipes that make use of email, SMS, Facebook and Twitter.

Belkin's WeMo Maker Kit isn't the most glamorous smart home product we've ever seen, but it falls in line with  FirstBuild's $20 Green Bean  and other maker-based products that let particularly hands-on DIYers automate something aside from the more traditional lights and plug-in modules. The $80 Belkin WeMo Maker Kit is available for preorder now with shipping slated for  November 18."
Okidokeys Smart-Lock: Feature-packed, obtrusive|"

LAS VEGAS -- A spin-off project from hotel smart lock provider OpenWays, Okidokeys has what looks like a comprehensive line of smart-lock products on its hands. Not only will the company be selling its Bluetooth-enabled Smart-Lock, but it also has an in-home gateway to sync up control of multiple locks, an electronic gate/garage door opener, as well as a door-mountable reader you can use to swipe your way inside your home.

Where other smart-locks companies have pursued a home-decor-friendly aesthetic for their products, though, Okidokeys' hardware is big, features multiple components, and has some obtrusive design elements.

You can buy a snap-on cover for the smart-lock housing in one of a few color options, and there's even one you can paint yourself, but the color change won't mitigate the size, and the covers are only available for the lock, not Okidokeys' other components.

Get past the design, and Okidokeys Smart-Lock sounds pretty appealing. Like many other smart locks, this one works with your existing ANSI Grade 1 and Grade 2 deadbolt, and is designed to be user-installable.

The Smart-Lock will then let you lock and unlock your door via your Bluetooth 4.0-equipped smartphone, with a traditional key, or, with the optional Smart-Reader, via wristband, a wallet card, and key fob accessories, all equipped with RFID chips.

All those options can grant hands-free, proximity-based access. They also make it easy for you to distribute access to different people, including non-smartphone owners. And as with Okidokeys' competitors, you can restrict each credential to a certain time frame, and also log your users' comings and goings.

As standalone products, the Smart-Lock base kit costs a competitive $179. The Smart Gate/Garage opener will sell for $99, and the Smart-Reader and the Smart-Gateway will each retail for $79 by themselves. Okidokeys also sells various packages, of which the $269 Connect Pack seems to be the best deal. That gets you the lock, the reader and a handful of RFID accessories, and the gateway. The latter is especially important if you want to control and monitor your lock set up remotely over the Internet (the lock and reader have no Wi-Fi component) or use multiple locks.

If you can live with Okidokeys' looks and want to make a purchase, the company says it will start taking orders for its various Smart-Lock products this month, and it will ship in the US in the early spring, with a European version to follow soon thereafter."
Samsung seizes security opportunities at CES 2014 with SmartCam HD and SmartCam HD Outdoor|"



LAS VEGAS -- Samsung has just announced that two more Wi-Fi IP cameras will join its home security roster -- the $179 SmartCam HD and the $229 SmartCam HD Outdoor. Both cameras offer 1080p streaming and wide angle lenses with 128-degree fields of view. That should mean that you will get to view crisp, clear footage of your home and the surrounding outdoor area all from a Web browser or the free Android or iOS SmartCam app.

The $179 SmartCam HD sounds very similar to the $199 DropCam Pro and to a slightly lesser extent, the $229 all-in-one security system, Piper. That makes SmartCam HD an intriguing option, but I'm especially interested in the HD Outdoor. That's because we haven't seen any DIY security systems that offer an outdoor camera.

The SmartCam HD Outdoor seems to be pretty easy to install, too, since it relies on a network cable connection rather than an outside outlet. So, the Wi-Fi hub stays inside near the router and then communicates with the camera remotely. The indoor SmartCam HD can be placed on a flat surface or mounted on a wall for flexible installation.

Both cameras use a 2MP 1/2.8-inch CMOS sensor, an IR cut filter, and offer night-vision mode. That should allow for detailed footage regardless of the lighting conditions. The HD has a 16-foot range, while the HD Outdoor has a 50-foot range.

You can opt to record on an ongoing basis or only when a security event takes place. You can also customize your settings to receive notifications when motion or sound is detected. And, there are no storage or monitoring fees associated with SmartCam.

The SmartCam HD and SmartCam HD Outdoor use local storage so footage is recorded directly to the camera on a memory card (up to 32GB). That's kind of uncommon; these cameras don't rely on remote servers and use compression tech to keep bandwidth at bay (more or less). That's why Samsung claims that ""the SmartCam HD's and HD Outdoor's video is streamed using only 30 percent of the network bandwidth of other IP cameras."" Both will be available in March 2014."
Withings Aura active smart sleep system slips under your bed, lives on your table|"

The world of wearable tech has birthed a lot of wrist-worn devices with sleep trackers, with limited amounts of actual sensory input. Instead of joining the fray, Withings has opted for another direction at CES 2014: a smart device that lives near your bed.

Withings Aura Active Sleep System is completely dedicated to sleep: it leaves the wristband behind, and uses a combination of an under-the-mattress sensor and bedside clock device to both monitor and improve sleep patterns.

The under-the-mattress sensor pad measures motion, including heart rate, breathing, and body movement. The bedside device senses noise pollution, lighting, and room temperature. The bedside part also acts as a combination clock and audio/visual stimulation system, using colored light and sound programs to sync with anticipated sleep and awake cycles, reminiscent of previous sleep-aid devices by companies like Homedics.

The $299 Aura is expensive, and looks more elaborate than the typical sleep-tracker you'd get on a Jawbone Up or Fitbit Force, but the Aura's bedside device does triple-duty as a clock, ambient light, and Bluetooth speaker. The Aura pairs with your phone, working with Withings' connected app ecosystem of blood pressure monitors, scales, and fitness trackers.

The Aura will be available this spring. It certainly seems like a device you'd need to actually see and use before judging it."
iControl Networks Piper review:|"

Editor's note, June 25, 2014: Piper pricing has been reduced from $239 to $199 and units are now compatible with Z-Wave light dimmers. The company has also added a feature called Bedside mode that lets you turn on a siren during a security event. This review was previously updated February 20, 2014, to account for the new Android app and again on April 3, 2014, to account for the addition of two-way audio and multi-unit support.

Piper is a $239 Wi-Fi-enabled home security system with an intriguing all-in-one style that diverges from the DIY security system mainstream. Lately we've seen a lot of starter kits that come with motion and door/window sensors, but no camera. Examples include $199 iSmartAlarm, $199 Oplink Security TripleShield, $229 Viper Home, and $229 SimpliSafe. It's tempting to compare Piper with simpler IP-based cameras like the Dropcam Pro, but it does much more than that.

While these systems offer individual accessories, and therefore more installation flexibility, every Piper comes with a camera, a siren, a motion detector, environmental sensors, and optional Z-Wave integration. And it's only $10 more than our favorite a la carte system, SimpliSafe (which doesn't offer a camera at all, not even as an add-on), and $40 more than the Dropcam Pro. So, if you're already planning to splurge on a siren and other accessories, Piper is the absolute best value, particularly for an apartment or a small house. If you're shopping for a high-end Web cam, the choice is a little less clear.

Features Piper comes with a 180-degree glass lens and a 1080p video camera, a motion sensor with a 30-foot detection range, a microphone, two-way audio, and a 105-decibel siren (meaning it's very loud). It also has built-in sensors that track humidity and temperature, and ambient light and sound. In addition to these features, you get a backup battery, flash storage, and RGB LEDs that change color when you adjust the system status. Piper's most interesting feature, though, is its ability to act as a Z-Wave hub. That takes this product from a basic DIY security system to something that can function as an automation hub for your entire home. It's also what separates it from the Dropcam, which for now only functions as an advanced Web cam.

Piper communicates with your phone via your home Wi-Fi network (SimpliSafe relies on both Wi-Fi and a cellular connection). So, the better the connection, the more accurate and consistent your video feed and sensor results. The free Android or iOS Piper app has a lot to offer, but one core feature it its ability to send you customized alerts based on rules you establish, such as, ""In away mode, if motion is detected, record video, notify me via phone call, and sound siren.""

It's important to note that whatever e-mail address and phone number you provide during the set-up process will be the information Piper uses to contact you during a security breach. The app provides the current indoor and outdoor temperature and a list of recent activities under the ""status"" bar. It also has graphs that track outdoor temp, indoor temp, humidity, ambient light, ambient sound, and physical activity over the past 48 hours. I love this feature -- I just wish that I could click on each graph for an expanded view.

Like the Dropcam Pro, you can zoom in on Piper's video image -- both lenses are fixed, so there's no remote pan-tilt-zoom functionality. Piper's 180-degree fish-eye lens gives you a larger field of view than the 130-degree Dropcam Pro, but the Dropcam's video quality looks crisper, even though both claim to offer 1080p video quality.

The two have similar policies for watching and recording video. You can watch a live feed from both cameras for free on your local network and remotely on a mobile device. Both offer cloud-based storage for recorded video -- Piper will automatically upload a 25-second clip (that's 5 seconds before a security event takes place and 20 seconds after, and each recording uses about 3MB and you can store around 1,000 clips before needing to erase the old ones), Dropcam charges a fee, starting at $9.95 a month for seven days of continuous footage. Piper plans to offer a fee-based continuous storage option for business owners in spring 2014 and a network-attached option for home users with larger storage needs.

Unlike Dropcam Pro, Piper doesn't offer night vision. So, if you want superior recordings in dark rooms, Dropcam Pro is a better choice. And while Dropcam Pro will send alerts based on sound and motion, it's really more of a webcam or surveillance camera than a home security system or a home automation hub for now.

The situation might change because Dropcam Pro has Bluetooth LE connectivity, which has a lot of ""smart home"" potential. Dropcam also says it's working on expanding into other smart home devices that might work with that Bluetooth LE signal. At that point, I'd want to revisit its webcam versus security system-ness -- but not yet. And you would still have to purchase any additional security or automation products separately, while Piper comes with pretty much everything you need to monitor a single room. That's why I think $239 Piper offers the best value for a simple DIY home security system. We also have our eye on the Canary, due out next year.

Compared with more traditional ""hub and component"" security systems, the Piper isn't quite as robust in some cases, but it excels in others. There are no monthly fees associated with Piper, but that also means there is no remote monitoring. Piper only notifies you of a security event, not the police or any remote dispatch team. SimpliSafe offers live monitoring for $14.99 a month. So, if you don't like the whole Wi-Fi thing and want your system to notify a dispatch team when a security event takes place, SimpliSafe makes a lot of sense. Then again, you can't just plunk SimpliSafe down in a room like you can with Piper. Just remember that it doesn't have a video camera.

Piper doesn't come with a door/window sensor or any other accessories, but that's where Z-Wave saves the day.  I tested out the Aeon Labs Aeotec Z-Wave door/window sensor and smart switch (included in the review packaging so I could test Z-Wave capabilities, but sold separately). Both are available on Amazon, as are many other Z-Wave products. The door/window sensor costs $42.75 and the smart switch costs $47.95. I think Amazon is the best place to search for Z-Wave gadgets, but I also like the variety offered on Smarthome, although prices tend to be higher.

Piper claims to be able to manage a whopping 232 Z-Wave devices. Sadly, I didn't have that many Z-Wave gadgets laying around, so I was unable to test this claim. Right now, you can pair Piper with ""plug-in modules, wall switches, motion sensors, freeze sensors, and open/close sensors"" with plans for an expanded list in 2014. So in addition to the two Z-Wave gadgets Blacksumac sent, I also tried to link a GE Z-Wave wireless lighting control fluorescent light and appliance module we had in the lab. It worked without a hitch.

Design and Usability Blacksumac did a fantastic job on this design -- it's modern and the construction feels solid. You can get Piper in either black or white and a matching black or white power cord will accompany it. Piper weighs 9.8 ounces, and it is 6.5 inches tall with the stand and 3.5 inches wide.

You have the option of mounting Piper on a wall or using the included stand to rest it on a flat surface. While it does offer battery backup, it relies mainly on a 7.5W AC/DC wall adapter for power, so consider outlet location when you're deciding where your Piper should go. That, and make sure you find a spot that will optimize Piper's potential to get great video footage.

Set-up couldn't be more straightforward, particularly if you're just putting it on a table or a countertop. Connect the power cord to Piper and then to the outlet and then press the small button on the back of Piper once. The LED on the front will immediately turn yellow. After a short time the light will turn blue and Piper will chime so you know it's ready for the next step.

Now you're ready to download the free Piper app on your Android or iOS device, create your login info, and then link it to your home Wi-Fi. That's it -- you can start using Piper. The whole thing should take 5 to 10 minutes from start to finish.

The Z-Wave door/window sensor and smart switch Blacksumac sent me to test with Piper were extremely easy to set up on the app. You simply go to settings, select Z-Wave accessories, add, and then start. It will walk you through everything you need to get them running right away.

The app design is pretty intuitive. I think it could be a bit more streamlined, but it is fairly easy to navigate. The dashboard, particularly, is a little busy, but everything you need to interact with the various features and monitor your home remotely is right there. It might take a little time to get used to, but the number of features offered makes up for any app design clumsiness.

Performance I put Piper through the ringer in our small appliance testing room. I set it up as I would have at home, including the additional Z-Wave door/window sensor and smart switch, which I connected to a lamp.

Then, I set up various rules in stay, away, and vacation mode. There's also a notify mode that will simply let you know if it detects motion, sound, temp changes, or doors opening (if you have door/window sensors) rather than triggering a siren or other security-related response. It did not disappoint. I got e-mails, texts, and phone calls every time I triggered the system, using both the Android app on a Nexus 7 and the iOS app on an iPhone 5.

Since the door/window sensor and lamp-connected smart switch were added, a new rule option was available to me in each mode: ""If door opens, turn on/off lamp."" The app and Piper communicate extremely well and I never had a performance issue that would cause concern. If anything, it was too sensitive to sound -- I sneezed very near Piper at one point and actually triggered the ""loud sound"" notification.

Conclusion I think Piper is the absolute best value among the DIY home security offerings we've seen so far. For $239 you get a video camera, a motion sensor, a siren, a microphone to detect sound, and built-in sensors that monitor environmental triggers like temperature and humidity. And the app integration lets you monitor your home in real-time and control any Z-Wave appliances -- with no monthly fee. And it works extremely well.

No other system provides all of those things, especially not at that price. And, while it's geared toward renters or smaller homes, you can have up to five Pipers in one house. That would be suitable for a very large home for any mansion-dwellers reading this who prefer the DIY route.

So, if you like the idea of an all-in-one device that runs on Wi-Fi, I think Piper is a fantastic option, particularly for a smaller home. We will be reviewing the similar $199 Canary, too, but I don't think it can come close to matching Piper on features. Not interested in a Wi-Fi-powered system at all? You may prefer the very highly rated SimpliSafe, complete with cellular connection and remote monitoring for $14.99 a month."
Belkin WeMo Insight Switch review:|"

Belkin's WeMo Switch smart power plug is one of our favorite smart-home devices because it provides such a low-risk home automation entry point. The new model, the $59.99 Belkin WeMo Insight Switch, has the same capabilities as the $49.99 original -- remote device power control, programmability, IFTTT support -- along with a more compact design, and the surprisingly deep ability to track the energy consumption of any gadget you plug into it.

Are those extras worth the $10 price premium? The smaller housing is more visually appealing than the original. For many people that alone will be enough. The energy consumption tracking won't be useful for everyone, but thanks to IFTTT, I can see certain use cases, particularly for tech-savvy parents and roommates. Taken together, the updates in the Belkin WeMo Insight Switch justify the higher cost, but Belkin still has plenty of room to improve the WeMo user experience. I would recommend this product, even if it's not quite polished enough for mainstream adoption.

Design and features The most obvious draw for the WeMo Insight Switch is its improved plastic housing. About half the size of the original WeMo Switch, and with a cleaner-looking, whiter shell, the Insight version looks like a more modern piece of hardware. An ideal version of this product probably would look more like Apple's iPhone USB plug adapter. At the very least, it would be nice if it one day became small enough that it wouldn't block off an adjacent plug. Even though it's smaller, the new design doesn't offer any improvement in that respect.

Along with the new housing, Belkin also tweaked some of the external features on the Insight Switch. The power-on indicator is much larger than on the original, making it easier to see. The indicator light also shines green now, instead of blue.

Another interesting external change comes by way of the Micro-USB port. Belkin says the port currently has no function, but that eventually it might offer sensors or other accessories to plug into it. For now, the Switch powers on when you plug it in via USB, but that's all it does.

The power consumption tracking seems to be the only major difference between the WeMo Insight Switch and the vanilla model on the software side. The core functions remain the same. At its most basic, the WeMo Insight Switch lets you remotely power devices on or off via an Android or iOS app. The app also lets you set rules that trigger the power according to a preset time, by local sunrise and sunset, or through motion detection via Belkin's WeMo Motion detector (a $59.99 extra). You can also use the rules to notify you when the switch senses that a connected device has turned on, or when it detects movement via the motion sensor.

Usability For the power usage tracking, I will say that it's thorough. Through the app, Belkin presents you with quick-glance real-time and average data for power draw, usage time, and operating cost for whatever device you've plugged into the Switch. Dig deeper into the app settings and you can adjust the energy billing rate and the power draw threshold it uses to determine whether a device is on or in standby mode. Those who really want to track power usage over time can output the data from the app to a smartly organized CSV file.

The WeMo Insight Switch really shines when you integrate its programmability with that energy tracking, though. For that, you'll need to familiarize yourself with IFTTT (""if this then that"").

IFTTT is an app-based set of ""recipes"" you can use to tie behavior between different devices and online services. Many smart-home products, including this plug, and Belkin's earlier WeMo Switch, have dedicated channels in the IFTTT app with device-specific recipes. Simply select a recipe for a specific behavior (""Send me a text when someone turns the lights on,"" or ""Flash the lights when someone tags me on Facebook"") and subscribe to apply it.

The IFTTT channel for the WeMo Insight Switch gives you two recipes in particular that greatly extend the smarts of this plug. ""Turn a device off after it's been on for X minutes a day,"" and ""Turn a device off after its energy costs more than $X in a day."" With either of these recipes you can automatically regulate device usage.

Parents hoping to control TV or game console usage should see the obvious appeal here. It could also help the penny-conscious manage air conditioning or other power-hungry devices' usage. I can even imagine a small business tying the energy cost recipe into a pay-as-you-go service.

Those two recipes are so useful, and so obvious, it begs asking why Belkin didn't simply build them into its own WeMo app to begin with. It's easy enough to find the WeMo Insight Switch channel on IFTTT. The problem is there's no way to tell whether you have overlapping recipes between the Belkin and IFTTT apps, other than bouncing back and forth between the two.

Another flaw in the WeMo Insight Switch comes down to its setup, a holdover from the original WeMo Switch. To connect to the plug from the smartphone app, Belkin requires you to connect to a special WeMo Wi-Fi signal coming from the plug itself. Ideally, you connect your smartphone to that WeMo network, then use the app to sync your phone with the plug, and then you're free to hop back to your regular Wi-Fi network. Sounds simple enough, but it never worked out that way on the first try. Whether I was at home or at work, sometimes Belkin's Wi-Fi network wouldn't show up, or would drop off after I'd logged on for a second, or, if I managed to stay on it, the app couldn't find the plug.

It all came together eventually, but the reason why is a mystery. One day it didn't work at all. The next day, it did. I didn't change any settings or update any software in between. Of course something triggered the change, but I can't tell you what. The benefit of using Wi-Fi to make this connection is that it frees Belkin from requiring hub hardware to bridge its devices and your network. That's worth something, but the connection process should still be less frustrating.

Performance Once you conquer its setup, the WeMo Insight Switch works as expected. Either through the WeMo app or through IFTTT, any rule or notification request behaved the way it was programmed. You might need to tweak certain settings along the way. As a simple test, I asked the WeMo app to notify me every time it turned a device on. Turns out, the LED light bulb I'd installed in my test lamp only pulled 6 watts of power, putting it under the 8-watt threshold I had set for the switch to determine whether it was in power-on or standby mode. Once I fixed the setting, the rule kicked in.

The app does lag a lot. It often seems to need a second or two to recognize the Insight Switch. The power data display might also stall when you unplug or manually switch off a connected device. It's hard to know whether the lag came from our wireless network or from the Switch itself, but any delay resolved itself in a second or two. Not having lag would of course be preferable, but there's not enough frustration here to really be an issue.

Conclusion Even if the WeMo Insight Switch isn't perfect, the appeal of this product is still very high for those looking to ease into home automation. It has no fees, and you don't need to worry about setting up multiple sensors. For the most part, it lives up to the present-day ideal of accessible smart home hardware. For that reason, I have no problem recommending this to home automation newbies, or someone with a specific need for the power consumption data."
SmartThings review:|"

EDITOR'S NOTE: Since publishing this review, SmartThings has added support for third-party products including Belkin WeMo devices, TCP smart LEDs, Philips Hue color-changing bulbs, the Sonos home music system, and the Ecobee thermostat. Read the full story here.

Curious about home automation? If so, you'll want to be sure to consider SmartThings. With a variety of helpful, multifunctional sensors, wide product compatibility, and a slick-looking smartphone app to control it all, last year's Kickstarter-born startup is one of the most appealing smart-home offerings yet. At $99 for a standalone SmartThings Hub and with sensor-rich kits starting at $199, it's a relatively affordable option, too -- especially given the fact that SmartThings doesn't charge its users a monthly fee.

This is a system that takes full advantage of home automation's immense potential. The sensors are designed to be as useful and as usable as possible, and beyond those, you'll have the option to add a great number of different third-party devices to your system, since the hub at the heart of the SmartThings setup uses both Z-Wave and ZigBee. By supporting those two wireless standards, SmartThings is compatible with everything from Schlage deadbolts to Honeywell thermostats. You'll also enjoy full compatibility with IFTTT (If This Then That), meaning you'll be able to use your sensors to trigger other IFTTT-friendly smart devices like the Belkin WeMo Switch or Philips Hue bulbs (not to mention integration with apps like Twitter, Google Drive, and Foursquare).

I was eager to learn whether SmartThings delivers on its promise of making the Internet of Things more accessible, so I installed and tested out one of the kits for myself. Setup was a relative breeze, and for the most part, the sensors I tested worked extremely well, never failing to do whatever I automated them to do. The recently revamped SmartThings app (free on Android and iOS devices, but not available for BlackBerry or Windows Phone users) was a worthy little control center, though at times I found it a bit cluttered and confusing. Overall, I liked what I saw from SmartThings, and would have no hesitations recommending its products to just about anybody with an interest in home automation.



Each SmartThings accessory revolves around the SmartThings Hub. Using Z-Wave or ZigBee, the Hub will communicate with your smartphone over Wi-Fi, then relay your control to each of the sensors and devices in your system. The Hub features a simple design, with no buttons or switches to worry about -- just plug it in, connect it to your router using the included Ethernet cable, then log in to the SmartThings app.

It's a similar experience to installing an Insteon Hub or a Revolv Hub, though it's worth pointing out that the SmartThings Hub costs a little less than the Insteon Hub, and a lot less than the $299 Revolv Hub. It's also worth noting that SmartThings and Revolv do a much better job than Insteon does of guiding you through the setup process with their respective apps (Revolv's app goes even further, offering detailed, automated help for the installation of third-party devices).

The SmartThings app features a stylish and appealing new design that will walk you through each step of the setup process with clear instructions, handy illustrations, and even quick video clips that demonstrate exactly what you need to do. I had the Hub up and running within seconds, and from there, installing the additional sensors that came with the kit was just as easy. You'll tell the app which sensor you want to install, then pull a tab to activate that sensor's battery. In moments, the Hub will pair with your sensor, and you'll be able to to start automating with it.

SmartThings recommends keeping within 10 feet of the Hub while installing a sensor, which is a pretty tight radius. After your device is hooked up, you'll have more latitude with placement, but not as much as we've seen from other systems, like Nexia Home Intelligence. In my tests, I saw a slight decrease in reliability whenever I moved a sensor more than 50 feet away from the Hub.

Fortunately, the SmartThings motion detector that comes included in both kit options doubles as a range extender for the Hub. As soon as I added one to my setup, those performance quirks disappeared. Keep in mind, though, that in order to take full advantage of the range extension, you'll need to place the motion detector roughly in between the Hub and the sensor you're trying to accommodate, which can obviously limit your placement options.

Aside from boosting the Hub's range, the motion detector does a good job of its primary function: detecting motion. In my tests, I was never able to sneak by it without setting it off, and when I programmed it to notify me of changes in motion, or turn on a lamp when I entered the room, it always came through. Over multiple days of testing, I also never saw a single false positive from it, though it did seem a little bit too sensitive at times. When I set it to monitor motion in our conference room, for instance, it would occasionally catch people walking by the door. This would be less of an issue if SmartThings allowed you to customize the sensitivity of the device within the app, but it doesn't. As it stands, you'll probably just need to be prepared to play with the positioning a bit to get it to work exactly as you'd like.



The motion detector isn't the only sensor in the SmartThings lineup with multiple functions. The magnet-powered entry sensor is even more impressive, featuring a built-in temperature tracker and vibration detection, too. The latter is especially nice for security-minded automators. Place an entry sensor on your window, for instance, and you'll get an alert if it opens, plus you'll get notified if the window breaks -- even if the magnet doesn't move in the process.

The third core sensor of the SmartThings lineup is the presence sensor. Clip it to your key ring, your kid's book bag, or your pet's collar, or toss it into your car's glove compartment. You'll be able to track whenever it enters the Hub's range and whenever it leaves -- a useful way of automatically triggering your smart devices when you come and go, or an easy means of keeping track of loved ones and valuables. In our tests, they never failed to notify me when one of my guinea pigs co-workers arrived at the office or left -- although there were a few strange false alerts that came through while we were eating lunch together. Still, they're handy, inconspicuous little devices, and a great way to automatically manage your automatable lights, locks, and thermostats.

That said, you might want to think twice before adding a presence sensor to your system. Straight out of the box, the SmartThings Hub will already detect the location of the primary user's smartphone in the exact same way that it detects the presence sensors, so if you're buying a system for yourself, including a presence sensor for your keychain would be a waste of money.

Buying them for others might not make sense, either, given the fact that the popular Web service and key SmartThings partner IFTTT just announced iOS Location as a new trigger channel. This means that anyone with an iOS device can easily program IFTTT to track his or her iPhone's location and use it as a trigger (the ""If"" of If This Then That). All you'd need to do is set a SmartThings device as the IFTTT response in your recipe (the ""That""), and it would be doing exactly the same thing as the presence sensor.

You'll be able to track all of your sensors in real time from the SmartThings app. Just log in and head to the app's Dashboard to see what's going on with each one. Additionally, you can view a tiled list of all devices (or ""Things"") along with their current status. There's a third option, too: head to the app's newly introduced ""Hello Home"" mode, which is designed to look like an SMS conversation between you and your system. If it ever detects changes at home, it'll tell you about it with a new message. You can answer back by saying things like, ""I'm home,"" or, ""Good morning"" in order to trigger Actions -- these Actions serve as customized modes for the system, and will let it know when it is and isn't important to deliver these notifications. You can also associate things like lights turning on or doors locking with these Actions.

The app's new design looks great, and there's definitely a certain charm to texting back and forth with your system. Still, the approach seems slightly convoluted. An event log that you can interact with isn't a bad idea, but given the plethora of settings and controls already packed into the Dashboard and Things screens, it feels perhaps a little redundant and possibly overwhelming. I give the developers at SmartThings credit for trying to make their app as powerful and informative as possible, and I definitely prefer this approach to the sparse, underdeveloped designs of some of the other smart-home apps I've tested out, but I think that they'd be wise to refine their vision a little more.

If anything, SmartThings might want to look to IFTTT for inspiration, as the IFTTT smartphone app is about as elegantly designed as you'll find. Since you can use your SmartThings devices as both the ""Ifs"" and the ""Thats"" of your IFTTT recipes, you can essentially control your entire system through the IFTTT app if you want, and in many of my tests, I actually found this to be an easier approach than using the SmartThings app. If you're using smart devices like Belkin WeMo products or Philips Hue bulbs that are IFTTT-friendly but not automatable directly through the SmartThings Hub, then you'll probably want to control your system through IFTTT anyway, since you won't have access to those gadgets within the SmartThings app.

Who should buy it? If you're looking to get started with home automation, I think that you should move SmartThings to the top of your list. Aside from a few flukey-seeming false positives, its sensors performed very well in my tests, never failing to catch a trigger. This means that you'll be giving your smart home a very solid foundation with a SmartThings kit, and one that you can build upon however you like, since it's compatible with so many different Z-Wave and ZigBee devices (not to mention the compatibility with online services and additional smart devices through IFTTT). Security-minded consumers will likely be pleased, too, given the extra functionality packed into the system's entry sensors, along with the option to automate lights and locks or add a Z-Wave siren into your system.

Even if you're already automating with another system, switching to SmartThings might make sense if you'll be able to integrate enough of your existing devices into the SmartThings Hub. At a price of $99, you might be able to expand the functionality of your system and open it up to a greater number of potential devices (you'll want to check with the SmartThings Web site for a full list of recommended compatible devices -- you can also find these within the SmartThings app)."
SimpliSafe Home Security review:|"

Editor's note (2/11/2015): We've recently looked into RF interference jamming, and how it can affect wireless security systems like SimpliSafe. For more,click here.

Do-it-yourself home security options seem to be growing more numerous by the day, and we've tested a lot of them. None of them have left us quite as impressed as SimpliSafe. With its wide variety of easy-to-install sensors, SimpliSafe protects your home in a way that's comprehensive and yet also remarkably user-friendly. The system is totally wireless and designed to keep running even if the power gets cut, and unlike most other DIY security kits, SimpliSafe features both live monitoring and a cellular backup. If something's amiss at home, you can count on your system to keep you and the authorities notified, no matter what.

SimpliSafe offers five different packages with a varying assortments of sensors, ranging in price from $229.96 to $539.85. That's quite a bit compared with other DIY options like the iSmartAlarm Preferred Package or Oplink Security's AlarmShield package, both of which cost $199. Also, unlike iSmartAlarm or Viper Home, SimpliSafe charges monthly fees in order to unlock fairly basic features.

You'll need to pay $19.99 per month in order to receive SMS and e-mail alerts, and if you want to control your system from your smartphone, you'll need to increase that to $24.99 a month. Even if you aren't interested in any of that, you'll still be paying $14.99 a month for the live monitoring and the cellular backup (you also have the option of foregoing the cellular connection and live monitoring altogether for a fee-free local alarm, but that isn't an approach I would recommend).

With so many fee-free competitors, I was initially skeptical of SimpliSafe's value, but then I installed and tested a system for myself. The setup process was as easy as I've seen from any home security offering, and once I was up and running, each sensor aced my tests. The more I used the system, the more it impressed me with its thorough and thoughtful security coverage. By the time I was finished, SimpliSafe had me fully won over. It's an outstanding value, and a deserving winner of our Editors' Choice award.

First impressions SimpliSafe isn't likely to win you over on looks alone. Its array of sensors all have a dated, plasticky appearance that seems downright ugly when compared with the sleek, modern designs of iSmartAlarm and Viper Home. The effect is even more stark when you compare SimpliSafe to an all-in-one security device like Piper -- you'll swear the two were designed twenty years apart.

But there's more to this system than meets the eye. Start setting it up, and you'll undoubtedly come to appreciate just how idiot-proof it is. You'll start with the remote keychain, which cleverly doubles as a USB flash drive. Plug it into your computer, and a menu will pop up to guide you through the installation process with step-by-step illustrations.

The first step is to plug in the base station, which serves as the brains of the system. It's large, but unlike the core components of most other DIY kits, you won't need to plug it into your router, so you'll have some flexibility about where to stash it. Once the base station has power, the menu will show you how to set up each of the sensors in your kit. For each one, you'll simply need to pull a tab to activate the batteries, then choose a wall on which to stick it. As you set your sensors up, the menu will provide helpful pointers on placing them in the right spots. When you're done, you'll be able to customize your settings right on your computer -- afterward, you'll plug the USB into a port on the top of your base station to automatically transfer your settings into the system within seconds.

If the menu isn't enough, you can also go to SimpliSafe's Web site to view a five-minute installation video, as well as short, useful videos that demonstrate how to best use each sensor. One quick note, though -- don't make the same mistake I did and watch the video about the panic siren while wearing headphones. The video shows off all 105 of the alarm's decibels by setting it off at full volume, and with headphones in, it's a little like triggering the siren with your ear pressed up against it.

Aside from the ease of installation, the true strength of SimpliSafe's design is in its many built-in safeguards. The cellular backup, included with all packages, is the most obvious one, as it eliminates the wire-cutting vulnerability of hardwired systems. I also appreciate that SimpliSafe will continue working even if the power goes out (many other systems will not, including iSmartAlarm and Oplink). Each SimpliSafe sensor is wireless, and all of them run on batteries that will last multiple years. The base station is the exception, as it needs to be kept plugged in, but it has a battery backup, too. Unplug the thing, and it'll keep on running for up to four days. Once the power is restored, the battery will recharge automatically.

There's also the fact that SimpliSafe comes with 24/7 live monitoring, which most DIY kits don't currently offer. In the event that something triggers your alarm, the system will notify a dispatcher (SimpliSafe currently licenses its dispatchers from Amcest, a New Jersey company). They won't call the authorities right away, though -- first, they'll try and call you, and ask for an established safe word. If you don't answer, or if you don't give them the correct safe word, they'll send the cops. I like this setup, since it means that the occasional false alarm won't end up wasting the time of emergency responders.

Other safeguards are more subtle. The wireless keypad serves as a convenient spot for arming and disarming the system, but it also serves as a sort of decoy, as many burglars might assume that it, and not the base station you hid behind the sofa, is the thing that's alerting the authorities, and waste time trying to destroy it. To this end, you can program the base station to sound its built-in siren in the event of an alarm -- or program it to keep quiet.

If you're worried about false alarms, rest assured that SimpliSafe is flexible. You can program the system to delay the alarm for up to 250 seconds in the event that one of the sensors is triggered, giving you plenty of time to punch in your code or pull out your keychain remote before any sirens go off or any dispatchers are notified. You can also customize which sensors work on a delay and which don't. Say you want a delay when someone comes in the front door, but an instant alarm if the basement window gets opened -- SimpliSafe will let you protect your home the way you want.

Sensors galore  You'll get a different variety of sensors depending upon which package you choose -- if you want any extras, you'll be able to add them to your system a la carte. The base station is capable of managing up to 41 of them, and no matter how many you choose you won't see an increase in your monthly fee.

SimpliSafe's lowest-priced package, the Starter Package, comes with the base station and the keychain remote, along with one entry sensor, one motion detector, and one wireless keypad. The entry sensor is the same kind of magnetic, two-part device that we've seen in other DIY security kits -- you stick the sensor to your door or window frame, then stick the magnet to the door or window itself. Whenever that door or window opens, the magnet will separate from the sensor and trigger the alarm. You can also set the base station to chime whenever the door is opened, which would be useful for a small business or for anyone who just wants to keep track of when people are coming and going.

In my tests, the entry sensors worked perfectly, just as they have with the other systems I've tested. That said, I give SimpliSafe bonus points for charging a little less per sensor than its competitors. Each additional entry sensor will cost you $14.99, compared to $24.99 from iSmartAlarm or Viper Home, and $29.99 from Oplink. You can also upgrade from the Starter Package to the Economy Package for $30, which will give you three additional entry sensors.

The motion detector worked well, too, and I appreciated the fact that it's a bit smaller and less conspicuous than some of the competitors' offerings. Again, I appreciated that SimpliSafe doesn't charge as much if you want to pick up an additional one -- extras cost $29.99, compared to $34.99 from iSmartAlarm, $39.99 from Oplink, and $49.99 from Viper Home.

As for the keypad, I think it's definitely a bit of an eyesore, looking more like a calculator from 1983 than a security device from 2013. Still, it's smarter than it looks. Aside from easily allowing you to arm or disarm the system, you'll be able to enter your master code and access some of the system's basic settings. In addition to that master code, you can easily add up to four guest codes that will allow someone to arm or disarm the system, but not access the settings.

You can also program a special ""Duress Code,"" which is just what it sounds like. If an intruder ever tries to force you to shut the alarm off, just punch it in. The sirens will stop and the system will appear to be disarmed -- but the police will still be notified.

SimpliSafe doesn't stop with entry sensors and motion detectors, though. Upgrade to the package number three, the Classic Package, and you'll see that your system now includes the panic siren I mentioned earlier, along with a smoke detector. Like a regular smoke detector, it'll beep like crazy whenever it detects smoke, but unlike a regular smoke detector it'll also trigger your alarm, alert a dispatcher, and notify you over e-mail or SMS. If a fire breaks out while you're away, SimpliSafe can alert the fire department on your behalf within minutes. What's more, additional SimpliSafe smoke detectors only cost $29.99. That's a similar level of smart functionality to the Nest Protect, at a savings of $100.

Package number four, the $449.87 Master Package, comes with a dedicated panic button that you can stick anywhere you like. Upgrade your system to the top-priced Ultimate Package, and among the 17 sensors that come with it you'll find a carbon monoxide detector, a leak detector, and a freeze detector to help monitor your home's temperature and protect against burst pipes. You'll also be able to add glass-break sensors to your setup for $34.99 each. That's a whole lot of potential with a single system.

What's missing  As many different sensors as SimpliSafe boasts, it's a little surprising that you won't find cameras anywhere in their catalog, especially considering they're something almost every other DIY competitor offers. If you're hoping for a system that will allow you to keep an eye on things remotely, or one that will automatically take photos and video during a break-in, you'll need to look elsewhere. For what it's worth, we were impressed with the cameras in both Oplink and Viper Home's kits, and less so with iSmartAlarm. Piper has a built-in camera as well, and might be worth consideration.

Another omission from the SimpliSafe lineup is the presence of any sort of compatibility with common home automation networks, like Z-Wave or Zigbee. This is something that you'll need if you want to be able to connect your system with any external smart home devices you may own -- ideally a door lock, or your lights. Piper and Viper Home both offer this as an option, which is a really nice feature. I know that I'd like to be able to arm and disarm my system simply by locking or unlocking the front door, and if the alarm goes off in the middle of the night, I'd definitely prefer for my lights to come on.

If home automation intrigues you, you should consider those options over SimpliSafe, or perhaps take a look at SmartThings, which boasts a wide array of security-minded sensors, will work with hundreds of Zigbee and Z-Wave devices, features IFTTT compatibility, and charges absolutely no monthly fees. SimpliSafe tells us that it's exploring an IP-based camera and home automation functions, but the company wouldn't commit to any concrete details for adding them.

Remote controls You'll be able to log in at SimpliSafe's Web site in order to control your security system and adjust its settings. The site is simple and easy to navigate, with all the tools you'll need to take full control of your home security. You can rename system components, add or edit user codes, tweak which sensors will set off the alarm and when, change how long the system will delay whenever you arm or disarm it, and much more. None of it is difficult or confusing to work with -- if you can change your computer's screensaver, you'll be able to change your system's settings.

Keep in mind, though, that you'll need to subscribe to the most expensive service plan ($24.99 per month) in order to access these controls remotely. This is a little disappointing, but in my opinion, it's worth the extra cash. If you find that you don't need that level of control over your system, you can downgrade to a less expensive plan at any time with no penalty.

In addition, you have the option of downloading the free SimpliSafe app to your Android, iOS, or Windows Phone device, then arm or disarm your system remotely. You'll also be able to check the current status of your sensors, or view an event log. The app is pretty bare bones in appearance, and it won't let you edit any system settings the way the website will -- although in a pinch, you could always log in to SimpliSafe's Web site using your phone's browser to access those settings. Still, it's a little odd that SimpliSafe didn't include any of the most commonly used settings within the app.

Should I buy it?

If you're looking for a flexible, comprehensive home security option that won't lock you into a long-term contract, then SimpliSafe absolutely deserves your consideration. It offers easy-to-use protection that's wide and well thought out, and most importantly, it just works. If I had the system installed in my home, I'd have no problem relying on it to be there when I needed it, especially given the fact that it utilizes both a cellular connection and a full battery backup. The fact that SimpliSafe systems come with a three-year warranty and a 60-day money-back guarantee doesn't hurt, either.

If you can't afford SimpliSafe's monthly fees, I'd recommend the fee-free iSmartAlarm, which offers basic protection on a budget. If the lack of cameras or home automation compatibility is a deal breaker for you, then you'll want to take a look at some of the other systems we've reviewed, or maybe try and design your own system with the help of SmartThings. Aside from that, I really can't think of a good reason not to recommend SimpliSafe over just about any other home security system. It's as full-featured and well-designed as any system I've tested, making it well worth the price, and a worthy winner of our Editors' Choice."
Cree unveils 75W replacement LED (hands-on)|"

At the start of this year, rising efficiency standards mandated an end to the manufacture of 75W incandescent lights -- putting out less than 15 lumens per watt just doesn't cut it anymore. Fortunately, LED bulbs are looking brighter than ever, with many energy-efficient options offering light outputs comparable to their incandescent predecessors.

Cree's just-announced 75W replacement LED is the latest offering for homeowners looking for better brightness, and after spending some time with one, I'm convinced that Cree has yet another winner on its hands. The bulb carries the familiar design of other Cree lights, with a white plastic body, ridged heat sinks, and a tacky, rubbery-to-the-touch finish on the glass bulb. The difference comes when you flip the thing on. With 1,100 lumens -- an extra 300 lumens' worth of light output over Cree's 60W replacements -- this bulb helps put to rest any lingering concerns about LEDs being too dim.



However, those extra lumens don't come without a cost. At an MSRP of $23.97, the 75W replacement costs $11 more than Cree's 60W replacement, making it almost twice the price. If you're buying matching bulbs for an entire room or even an entire home, that isn't an insignificant expense, and unless the added brightness is truly necessary, you'd probably be perfectly happy saving your money and sticking with 60W replacements. Still, it's worth noting that Cree's greatest competition seems to be itself. A comparable 75W replacement LED from Philips, for instance, will cost upward of $30 -- and it won't come with anything close to the industry-leading 10-year warranty that Cree offers with all of its bulbs, including the new 75W replacement.

Uptick in pricing aside, I'm impressed that Cree has managed to up the light output without sacrificing very much in terms of efficiency. Its 60W replacement uses 9.5W to produce 800 lumens, meaning that it produces a very respectable 84 lumens per watt. The 75W replacement holds firm at about 81 lumens per watt, using just 13.5W to give off its 1,100 lumens. At an average of 3 hours of usage per day, your yearly energy cost per bulb would be just $1.63.

The fact that the 75W replacement is almost exactly as efficient as the 60W replacement is almost certainly no accident. In October, the 60W replacement earned Energy Star certification, qualifying it for consumer-friendly rebates in certain areas and driving the cost as low as $4.97 per light. With specs so similar to that bulb, it isn't hard to imagine the 75W replacement earning Energy Star certification, too. If that happens, expect prices to come down in regions that offer rebates, which would be a win for Cree and a win for consumers.

The introduction of the 75W replacement falls in line with Cree's strategy of covering its bases. After establishing a very solid baseline bulb for a very affordable price, the team at Cree have expanded light by light to offer different variations designed to appeal to different consumers. Want a less yellowy tone? Try one of Cree's daylight bulbs, with their cooler 5,000K color temperature (most other Cree bulbs, including the 75W replacement, sit on the low, warm end of the spectrum at 2,700 K). Want more vivid, accurately rendered colors? Go with the TW Series LED, which bumps Cree's standard color rendering index (CRI) up from 80 to 93. Now, with its 75W replacement and the 1,100 lumens that come with it, Cree's got a bulb that's sure to please consumers who simply want the most brightness for their buck.

Of course, the true feather in Cree's cap is that 10-year warranty, especially given the bold performance claims of its bulbs. Aside from being rated to last 25,000 hours (that's over 20 years at 3 hours a day), Cree bulbs are dampness-rated for indoor as well as outdoor use, and they're also fully compatible with almost all standard dimmers. That's quite a lot to warrant for a whole decade. Clearly, Cree has a great deal of confidence in the quality of its lights, and wants its customers to feel the same way, no matter which bulb appeals to them.

The lighting landscape is changing rapidly, and by releasing another high-quality, high-efficiency bulb that's more affordable than the competition, Cree remains ahead of the curve. The new 75W replacement LEDs are available online or in-store at Home Depot, although consumers in regions that offer energy rebates might want to hold off to see whether or not the bulb earns Energy Star certification before making a purchase."
Quirky Spotter Multipurpose Sensor review:|"

Editors' note: This review has been updated to reflect app and firmware upgrades, as well as the addition of a dedicated Spotter channel on IFTTT.

The Spotter is a small, puck-shaped device that's a result of the Quirky + GE partnership and jam-packed with tantalizing tech. There's an accelerometer for motion detection, as well as sensors for light, sound, temperature, and humidity. With the free Wink app downloaded to your iOS or Android device, you'll be able to set up alerts for all of it. Want to know if the front door opens while you're at work, or if the wine cellar is getting a few degrees too warm? Want an alert when the dryer stops spinning, or if the baby starts crying? For a retail price of just $50 -- comparable to competing sensors that track just one thing -- the Spotter promises to let you know.

After testing and reviewing the Spotter late last year, I came away disappointed with its spotty performance. As an environmental trigger capable of working with other Quirky products, like the Pivot Power Genius and the recently released Aros Smart Air Conditioner, it showed a lot of promise, but I still wondered if had perhaps been prematurely rushed to retail in order to catch the holiday shopping season.

Since then, however, the Spotter has seen a number of upgrades to its app and firmware, along with the exciting addition of a dedicated channel on the popular online automation service IFTTT. I called the Spotter a work in progress back in November -- now, in May, is it any closer to its full potential?

The short answer is yes, but it's still not quite as good as it needs to be. Overall sensor and alert accuracy is noticeably better than it was six months ago, but it's still too inconsistent, especially when it comes to detecting light. IFTTT integration is a great addition, allowing you to sync the Spotter up with products like Belkin WeMo Switches and Philips Hue LEDs, but your trigger options are too limited. With its relatively low price, interested consumers can likely afford to go ahead and pick the Spotter up and give it a try. Still, I wouldn't recommend relying on it for anything as important as monitoring a baby until the engineers at Quirky finally work out the rest of the Spotter's less endearing quirks.

The Spotter sports an efficient and thoughtful build. Aside from relying on the built-in magnet, you can also attach it to your wall or door with a pair of mounting screws, or with a sticky tab (as little as the Spotter weighs, you could probably get away with a loop of duct tape, too). At 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick, it's a compact, unobtrusive device -- and simple, too. You won't find a single button anywhere on it. This gives the Spotter a true sense of plug-and-play minimalism. Once you place it where you want it and plug the thing in, you'll be done fiddling with it.

This also means that the Wink app used to control the Spotter is hugely important, and fortunately, Quirky did an admirable job of putting it together. Unlike many of the other home automation control apps that we've come across, Wink has an elegant, well-designed user interface. It walks you through the initial setup process with step-by-step illustrations, and in our experience, helped us connect the Spotter to our Wi-Fi network in less than a minute.

To do so, you'll enter your local network information into the app, and then hold your phone's screen over the top of the Spotter. The app will count down from three, followed by a rapid series of bright flashes. The photocell built into the Spotter's light will ""read"" these flashes, and in a matter of seconds, your Spotter will be online. It's a pretty nifty way of connecting a device, and in our tests, it worked perfectly well each time (the Revolv Hub uses a similar trick that also tested well).

Once your Spotter is connected, you'll be able to use the Wink app to set alerts for each of the device's sensors. If your Spotter is plugged in, you'll be able to put all five sensors to work; in battery mode, it'll only track light and motion. Setting these alerts is easy. Just tap the icon for the sensor you want to track, define your trigger, and select the corresponding action.

For instance, if you select the light sensor, you can choose either a light trigger or a darkness trigger, then tell the Spotter to alert you when that happens via smart phone notification, or to send you an e-mail. If you also own a Quirky Pivot Power Genius, you'll have the option of setting the Spotter to toggle one of your smart outlets on or off, too.

There's really nothing in the app that I can find major fault with -- everything that's there is intuitive and easy to use. However, there are a few key features still missing from the Wink app six months after the Spotter's release. One example: you still won't find any sort of timeline of past notifications, a helpful feature that we've seen in a lot of other sensor-based apps, like the SmartThings app.

Here's an even greater omission: you still can't check the status of the Spotter's sensors in real time. Quirky has added in a status indicator for each sensor, but it only tells you what the Spotter sensed the last time it communicated with the app. You can't pull to refresh, or force the indicator to re-check. You're forced to wait until it updates on its own, and in my tests, this was often quite a long time. I found myself fully aware of what the temperature was fifteen minutes before, but unable to see what it was at that moment.

Another feature still missing from the Wink app is the ability to customize the sensitivity of each sensor. You can have the sound sensor alert you when it detects a loud noise, but you don't have the option of defining ""loud."" In some situations, you might want a supersensitive trigger, and in other situations, you might not, but right now, that isn't something that you can adjust.

Quirky's Spotter is clearly a pretty good idea, and the already strong Wink app has room to get even stronger. But the real question is whether or not the Spotter itself performs reliably. After all, it doesn't matter how slick the app is if you can't count on those sensors to deliver accurate and consistent results.

I started out with the Spotter's motion detection capabilities. The Spotter uses a built-in accelerometer -- the same as you'll find in the common smartphone -- to track whenever it's in motion. This means that motion detection is a bit of a misnomer. The Spotter will detect a door opening if it's mounted to the door, but if it's mounted to a wall on the other side of the room, it won't be able to ""see"" that door opening the way that a traditional motion detector would.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- accelerometer-based motion detectors have their own unique benefits, like vibration detection. Still, it's something to be aware of as you plan out how you might put your Spotter to use, and something that I wish Quirky was a bit clearer about.

The rest of the sensors are more straightforward. The light sensor will detect when lights go on or off. The sound sensor will detect loud noises, or when things suddenly get quiet. The temperature and humidity sensors will alert you if either gets too high or too low (although, again, they'd be much more useful if they consistently let you monitor conditions in real time. A ""pull to refresh"" option for each sensor seems like the obvious fix).

In my tests, I was able to get each sensor to work at one time or another -- but I was only able to get the temperature and motion sensors to work consistently. Noise detection alerts came through fairly regularly, but didn't seem as reliable as temperature and motion. Light detection was the problem child. I told the Spotter to alert me whenever it suddenly got light or dark, then placed it directly beneath a light bulb in a dark room. After flipping the switch every couple of minutes for about fifteen minutes, I had received exactly one alert. This was an even worse result than when I tested it out last November.

Simply put, the Spotter is still too temperamental. It will work fine for a short while, but then stop working after you move it to a new location, or unplug it and switch over to battery mode, or tweak a notification setting. Whenever performance drops out, your best bet is to power it down and then reboot it like a fussy old computer in order to get it working again.

It's perhaps my biggest complaint about the Spotter's performance: it isn't just inconsistent -- it's inconsistently inconsistent. It'll stop working at different times for seemingly different reasons. Motion detection seems to be the most reliable sensor, but only until it stops working altogether and the Spotter needs to be reset. Sound detection worked, but I could never quite figure out how loud a sound needed to be in order to trigger a notification. Shutting a door from 10 feet away would work, but not a loudly ringing phone just a few inches away.

The temperature sensor had its issues, too. At one point last November, I was able to detect subtle heating changes of a few degrees -- but then I set it to alert me if the temperature dropped below 50 degrees Fahrenheit and walked outside into 35-degree weather with it on an extension cord. Nothing happened.

I wanted to see if this was still an issue, so I took the Spotter outside on a warm, sunny day. It did a great job, reporting the correct temperature within about two minutes. From there, I brought it back inside and tossed the thing into the fridge. Suddenly, the results weren't so hot.

As I kept my eye on the Wink app, the temperature dropped painstakingly slow. Ten minutes later, the app was still telling me that the temperature was over sixty degrees. It took another fifteen minutes for the temperature to fall anywhere close to the correct level of 40 degrees. Clearly, when the temperature drops, so does the Spotter's performance.

The final thing I wanted to be sure and test was the Spotter's new IFTTT channel. With access to popular automation products like SmartThings sensors and WeMo Switches, not to mention handy online services like Pushbullet and Google Drive, IFTTT gives any smart-home product an instant IQ boost.

However, that boost was more limited than I'd like. As of now, you can't use changes in light, motion, sound, or humidity to trigger your IFTTT recipes -- you can only use temperature changes. To me, that feels like a waste of the Spotter's hardware. Hopefully, like the Spotter itself, the IFTTT channel gets smarter with time.

Still, I wanted to try it out, so I plugged my desk fan into a WeMo Switch, then crafted an IFTTT recipe that brought the Spotter into play. If the Spotter detected a temperature above 70, then IFTTT would tell my WeMo Switch to turn the fan on.

To speed the process up, I took the Spotter outside, which I already knew would give me a nice, warm reading in no time flat. Sure enough, the temperature spiked from the 60s up into the 80s, and like clockwork, my fan turned on. I tested this again and again, along with having the fan shut off when things dropped back below 70. Each and every time, it worked as planned.

The Spotter's taken some steps in the right direction, particularly with respect to IFTTT integration. Still, there's some work to be done if it ever hopes to become the must-have automation accessory I once thought it might be. At just $50, and with so much functionality, I don't think I'd mind putting up with a few performance quirks here and there. That said, I'd still want to feel like I had an accurate multi-sensor capable of reliably alerting me when needed, and Spotter just isn't quite there yet.

Quirky specializes in crowdsourcing good ideas and bringing them to market, and the Spotter is no exception. It's a good idea, and I'm glad that Quirky brought it to market. I just wish that the execution was better. Even now, six months after its initial release, with improved firmware, a slightly better app, and IFTTT integration to boot, its still too much of an under-performer for me to recommend outright."
Yale Real Living Touchscreen Z-Wave Deadbolt review:|"

Click here for more information on how we evaluate lock security.

Your smart lock options are quickly expanding, but you'll still want to take a look at the Yale Real Living Touchscreen Z-Wave Deadbolt. With plenty of customizable features and a modern-looking, ""cellphone chic"" design, Yale's two-year-old lock fits right in with the current crop of smart offerings.

So what's so unique about this deadbolt? Not very much, actually. Schlage caught up to Yale earlier this year, releasing their own Z-Wave powered touchscreen deadbolt. And Yale's lock doesn't offer next-gen features like one-touch entry, Bluetooth recognition, or NFC compatibility, the way that new smart locks like August, Goji, Lockitron, and the Kwikset Kevo will.

Still, Yale's lock is compatible with a wide variety of home automation systems, including several fee-free options, and that's certainly more than Schlage can say about its Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt. Also, Yale's deadbolt is the only lock we've seen thus far that actually talks to you, offering helpful feedback in one of three languages as you navigate its programming menu. While it isn't as flashy as some of the newer smart locks out there, it definitely holds its own, doing almost everything you'd want a basic smart lock to be able to do, and doing it well.

That said, the price point will likely come into play for most consumers giving Yale their consideration. At an MSRP of $275, the Yale Real Living Touchscreen Z-Wave Deadbolt is one of the most expensive locks on the market, more expensive than the Kevo, the Camelot, or any of the other smart locks due in the next few months. You can get it significantly cheaper online (as of this writing, the cost on Amazon was down to $244), and even cheaper still if you opt for the same deadbolt without the Z-Wave adapter or touch screen. Even at full price, Yale's lock might make sense over Schlage since, unlike the Camelot, you aren't required to use a fee-based automation system in order to unlock its full features.

In the end, the defining characteristic for Yale's smart lock might be the many home automation systems it's compatible with. If you've already invested in one of these systems and would like to integrate a smart lock into your setup, then the Yale makes a lot of sense, perhaps the most of any lock that we've looked at. If not, then you'll have to purchase one of these systems in order to take full advantage of the Yale's features (remote control, conditional automation, etc.). In the process, you'll tack the price of that system onto the already considerable price of the lock itself. In that situation, I'd rather go with an easier and less expensive option that offers full functionality right out of the box, like the Kevo.

The first thing that you'll notice about Yale's smart lock is the touch screen. It's sleek, glossy, and capacitive, unlike the resistive touch screen that you'll find on the Camelot's touchscreen. This gives it a brighter, slightly sharper display, and one that you won't need to press down on quite so hard. You might expect that, like the capacitive touchscreen that you'll find on most smartphones, you'll either need to be bare-handed or wearing special gloves in order to key in your code. With Yale's lock, however, I found that the screen responded to my touch even through thick, non-conductive fabric (I even tested it out wearing oven mitts, and the thing still worked). Yale told me that they're aware that their touch screen skews toward the sensitive side, but they wouldn't go so far as promising that it will work through all fabrics, so your gloved mileage may vary.

After installing your lock and turning it on, you'll be asked to enter a ""programming code."" This is the master code that will allow you to enter the lock's ""Programming Mode"" -- from here, you'll be able to add or delete access codes (the Yale can store up to 25 of them), connect your deadbolt to a local network, and tweak the lock's settings. You'll also be able to activate ""Privacy Mode,"" which automatically disables all codes, temporarily turning your smart lock into a regular old lock.

As you're playing with the Yale's settings, you'll realize that this is a lock that speaks to you, offering clear, concise commands and notifications. It's one of my favorite features of the lock, especially within Programming Mode, where you select the setting you wish to tweak by choosing its corresponding number. In other, similar smart locks, you'd need to memorize which number went with which setting, or at least keep the instruction manual handy for quick reference. Even then, the only reassurance you'd have that you entered the right series of digits to achieve the desired change would be a not-terribly-helpful flash or beep. With the Yale lock, you could go in knowing nothing and still find your way to the correct, confirmed setting simply by letting the voice be your guide.

Since the Yale uses Z-Wave or Zigbee in place of a standard Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection, you won't be able to control it directly from your smartphone, and as such, there isn't a native Yale app for you to download. If you want to unlock the full functionality of your deadbolt, you'll need to add it to an existing home automation network, or purchase a compatible device capable of controlling it. Fortunately, you have a wide selection of options, including popular choices like Control4 and Mi Casa Verde. Here at our offices, we tested the Yale lock out using a Revolv hub, and had no trouble whatsoever getting the thing hooked up with our system. Revolv lets you remotely lock and unlock the deadbolt or set something like a motion sensor to trigger it to do so automatically. Other systems might offer additional options, like creating and managing user codes remotely.

It's definitely a positive that this lock will work with such a large number of automation setups -- Schlage's Camelot deadbolt, by comparison, is designed to work best with Nexia Home Intelligence, a home automation system that costs $8.99 per month to use. Still, it's worth noting that we liked both the Nexia app and Web site quite a bit, and especially enjoyed that Nexia allows you to create temporary codes for your lock that expire automatically (not all systems offer this level of functionality). At a price of just $59 the Nexia Bridge is also significantly less expensive than most other control hubs (the Revolv Hub, for instance, will set you back $299). The choice offered by Yale is certainly appealing and monthly fees certainly aren't, but still, don't be too quick to rule out Nexia.

Physically, this is a well-constructed, well-designed piece of machinery. I appreciated the thin rubber mats that sit between the door and both the inner and outer sections of the lock. These help you avoid scuffs as you tighten the lock into place, and they also give the lock an extra layer of protection against moisture. In my tests, the lock operated perfectly well even after I poured an entire cup of water directly over top of it.

The deadbolt can be set to automatically re-lock if left open for a user-defined time period (the default is thirty seconds). This is a nice feature for those who often forget to lock the door behind them when they leave the house, but I wish there was an option for the deadbolt to only re-lock when the door is closed. There's a small potential for minor damage if you leave the door open, then mistakenly try and close the door after the bolt has automatically been thrown.

One point of note -- the interior section of Yale's lock is larger than a normal deadbolt, as it needs to house the lock's network adapter, its motherboard, and the four AA batteries that keep it powered (they come included). We've seen similar designs from almost all of the smart locks we've seen, so it's hard to hold this against Yale. Still, consumers worried about purchasing a lock that leaves too much of a footprint on their foyer's interior design will want to take note. It's also worth mentioning that Kwikset's Smartcode Deadbolt features an interior housing that's up to 30% smaller in size than the housing on the Yale, the Camelot, or the Kevo. If size is a concern, this is a lock worth looking into.

The classic pin and tumbler lock was patented by company founder Linus Yale, Jr. in 1861, and sure enough, that's the kind of lock you'll find in their touchscreen deadbolt. This means that the Yale doesn't offer any special protection against picking or bumping, the same as almost all standard, residential-grade pin and tumbler locks. If this is a particular concern of yours, more so than the threat of brute bypass methods, then you'll want to take a look at the Kwikset Kevo, which is rated by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) as essentially pick- and bump-proof. You might also want to consider the fact that Yale offers a key-free model, with no keyhole or cylinder at all. If you're truly worried about lock picks, this could be an interesting option -- just make sure to keep plenty of fresh batteries on hand.

Relative to other pin and tumbler locks, there's nothing about Yale's cylinder that stands out as an overt vulnerability, and I couldn't find any quick bypass methods floating around the internet to be concerned with. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) certifies Yale's lock as a Grade 2 deadbolt, which means that it can withstand a large degree of force and pressure before failing. This is a satisfactory score for a residential-grade deadbolt -- though the Schlage Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt does even better, earning the top rating of Grade 1.

As for hacking concerns, Yale's wireless Z-Wave adapter sends information out over a 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128). AES 128 is the standard level of encryption for all modern Z-Wave devices, and is also used for things like military communications and online banking transactions. It provides ample protection against hacking from all but the most sophisticated of thieves. In other words, unless you're concerned that James Bond is going to try and hack your deadbolt, you shouldn't lose any sleep over the Yale's cyber-security.

Another potential security concern involves the touchscreen. Just like your phone, it'll get faint smudges on it when you touch it, and theoretically, a clever thief could use these smudges to figure out which numbers you use for your code. From there, they would only need to guess the correct sequence in order to gain entry.

Fortunately, this isn't nearly as simple as I just made it sound. Four unique digits are capable of producing twenty-four unique four-digit codes. The Yale will shut down after a certain number of failed attempts -- set this number to three, for instance, and a thief who knew the digits you used would only have a 12.5% chance of guessing the correct sequence before the lock powered down. Additionally, this thief would only be able to discern these digits if you never pressed any other buttons on the lock, which seems unlikely. Even if you live alone and never plan on using the programming menu, all you'd have to do is issue yourself a second code with different digits, then alternate between the two. And, of course, you could always set a longer code -- up to eight digits with the Yale.

The lock runs on four AA batteries, which you will need to replace periodically. You'll receive advanced warning when they're running low, and if you ignore this, you'll be forced to (gasp) use the key to get in. As for the warranty, Yale's smart lock comes with a lifetime guarantee on the mechanical operation of the lock and on its finish. The electronic components, on the other hand, only come with a standard one-year warranty. Given the price of the lock, I'd feel a little better about recommending it if it came with a slightly longer warranty.

Conclusion

The Yale Real Living Touchscreen Z-Wave Deadbolt has just about everything you'd want in a basic smart lock. It won't offer anything quite as flashy as the tech you'll see from next-gen locks like Kevo, Goji, August, or Lockitron, but it's certainly smart enough to keep up.

The problem here is that not all of these new locks are out yet, meaning we don't yet have a full idea of where the best value lies.  As a product that's already been on the market for almost three years, I suspect that Yale's $275 smart lock is going to have a tough time competing with newer, more buzzed about smart locks that, across the board, cost less. If you've already got a home automation system, and you think the Yale lock would be a good fit for your setup, I say buy it with confidence. But if you're just looking for a standalone smart lock with full, out-of-the-box functionality, I think you'll probably be happier waiting to see what else hits the market -- and how those new competitors affect Yale's price point."
Nest Protect review:|"

Editors' note, June 16, 2014: After an official recall on May, 21, 2014, the Nest Protect returned to retail today. For now, sales are limited to online stores including Nest.com, Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, and HomeDepot.com. The updated units do not have the Wave feature which prompted the recall decision, and there are no specific plans to bring it back in the future. To account for this loss, Nest reduced the price of its Wi-Fi smoke and carbon monoxide detector to $99.

How do you make a smoke detector cool? It's hard, and more difficult still to glamorize a carbon monoxide detector. Under ideal circumstances, you'll never hear a peep out of either.

Nest took a crack at reinventing the boring old smoke alarm anyway. The upstart company, famous for its five-star Nest Learning Thermostat, aims to reimagine the dull, annoying, or dysfunctional white-label products around your house. As such, Nest took the passive wall wart of yesterday and transformed it into the Nest Protect, a Wi-Fi-ready smoke alarm and CO monitor. And while the Nest Protect doesn't necessarily revolutionize the smoke detector, it resets the curve for the competition.

The Nest Protect is a Wi-Fi smoke detector and carbon monoxide monitor, costs a brain-bending $129, and -- thanks to its brand-new Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certification -- arrives tomorrow for anyone who preordered a unit. But it's the Wi-Fi integration that sets Nest Protect apart and gives it powers no other alarms can claim, including the ability to send alerts to the Nest smartphone app. I spent a weekend with two Nest Protect alarms set up in my house alongside a Nest thermostat, and I grew fond of these rethought detectors.

What the Nest Protect does  For $129 for each unit, you'd expect a pair of these alarms to make you a cup of coffee while protecting your family. They don't, and you can find other wireless, networked combination smoke-and-carbon-monoxide detectors on the market for as little as $65. To set itself apart, the Nest Protect solves a few problems you might not realize you have with your current detectors.

When an alarm first sounds, Nest projects a human recorded voice to tell you that smoke or carbon monoxide may be gathering. If you have more than one Nest Protect on your network, the alarm repeats anywhere in the house with a connected Nest Protect identifying the nature of the emergency and its location. Both wired (with backup battery) and battery-powered versions run when the power and Wi-Fi go out, so they'll continue to communicate over a proprietary mesh network. The Nest Protect's voice sounds pleasant but firm -- like a (rare) mother who got a full night of sleep or maybe the announcer on a Virgin America preflight safety video.

Because it wouldn't be safe to fill my garage with carbon monoxide, I will rely on the exhaustive UL certification program to have tested the Nest Protect's ability to sense dangerous materials in the air. But with a can of a special mist used explicitly for testing smoke detectors and a brand-new smoke detector from First Alert installed next to the Nest, I confirmed that the Nest alarm is swift and loud.

The siren itself sounds very much like a typical smoke detector -- identical in detection speed and alarm sound to the First Alert unit. When I waved the smoke wand in the hallway upstairs, the Protect in the downstairs playroom also blared, reporting along with the siren that ""there's smoke in the hallway."" Once the (canned) smoke dissipated upstairs, both Nest units reported throughout the house that the smoke had cleared. When I silenced the Nest alarm upstairs, its companion downstairs alarm piped down, too, albeit after a slight delay.

One of the Nest Protect's charms is the ability to wave to silence the alarm when something small like a burnt toaster pancake sets it off.  While Nest says that small children and pets cannot hush the alarm, both my 10-year-old (he's tall) and I were able to silence the alarm with a pleasant but persistent wave. It's a good thing that you have to work to silence the Nest Protect because you want to be certain an area is safe before calling off the hounds, so to speak. I did notice that while the Nest Protect can work at recommended heights on both walls and on the ceiling, the ability to silence by waving works much better when the Nest Protect is mounted on the ceiling.

Relatively easy setup Here's the thing about the old-style smoke alarms: unless you're hooking up hardwired detectors, installing one is as easy as adding batteries and screwing the mounting plate into a wall. Because the Nest Protect works on a network, you'll need to add each unit to your network, one at a time. The process is a breeze (I'll talk more about that below), but it does take a few more minutes.

True to form, Nest sells the Nest Protect with charmingly thoughtful packaging. The clean, sturdy box makes unpacking the device fast and free of hardshell-induced plastic cuts on your hands. The included instruction manual is much more complicated than the one that comes with the Nest Learning Thermostat, but the safety issues involved demand the extra length. And in comparison with the instructions accompanying competing devices, the Nest manual reads like Longfellow.

Hanging the Nest Protect on the wall means screwing in a mounting plate, just as with a traditional smoke detector. The included screws are sturdy and work in many types of walls, and the detector snaps into the mount easily. I was a little sad to see that these don't come with their own handy screwdriver like the Nest thermostat does.

When I was ready to install my Nest Protect units, I updated my app, then scanned the QR code on the back of the device. The app then walked me through how to add my Nest Protect to my home network, which required me to enter my home router's Wi-Fi password and asked me to name each device according to its location. Everything worked on the first try and the entire process took less than 2 minutes. I did have to repeat this process for each detector. If you were installing a houseful of Nest Protects, the process would take you a decent chunk of time.

Pleasant extras  Part of what makes the Nest Protect so clever is all the sensors it houses, including smoke, heat, carbon monoxide, moisture, and movement sensors. All these sensors let the detector act as a sentry in your home. If you also own a Nest thermostat, the Nest Protect will tell it when you're in a remote part of the house for a long period of time, which prevents the thermostat from setting itself to Auto Away mode and raising or lowering the temperature of your home more than is comfortable. I tested the Nest Protect over the weekend while my house was busy, so it's hard to confirm that this cool feature worked, but it's true that my house stayed a comfortable temperature even while my family was gone and I was working in a bedroom far from the thermostat.

Now, I wouldn't buy a Nest Protect for its ability to trigger my thermostat, but it's a nice extra that hints at possible futures for Nest as a company. The more rooms in a house with Nest-powered sensors, the more devices could eventually speak to one another and to a Nest app, from security cameras to remote locks to light bulbs. (Whether that's a future you want is up to your appetite for home automation dominated by a single brand.)

Also thanks to the Nest Protect's onboard sensors, the device can serve as a dim nightlight. Walk underneath the Nest Protect in the dark, and the ring glows white to illuminate your path. In my tests, the room must be totally dark for the nightlight to work, and it's not bright. But it does make it easy to navigate the floor in a room, which helps with children's midnight trips for a glass of water and would be especially helpful in any emergency including earthquakes or other non-fire-related episodes.

The Protect tests itself regularly, and when you turn off the lights in a room and the room turns totally dark, its ring glows green to show that it's done its job and the room is safe from CO or smoke and that the device's batteries are still good. This is a fun feature that reminds you that your $129 investment is actually working, but it's just that: a fun extra.

Rethinking detector design  At first glance, the Nest Protect looks nothing like a device you might expect from Nest. For starters, it's square and comes in white or black -- quite unlike the round, silver Nest Learning Thermostat. According to Nest, the square shape sets this device apart from its old-fashioned competition, and the lacy, flowerlike design of the top panel gives more points for smoke and particulate to enter and trigger the alarm. Regardless, this is the prettiest smoke detector you'll find.

The Nest Protect isn't, however, the slimmest smoke detector on the market. Competitors come in all shapes and sizes, including some of the notably slimmer and smaller devices I've photographed here. These competing products lose the Wi-Fi ability, though, which presumably takes up more space in the Nest; and while some may prefer their design, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The Nest Protect strikes a sophisticated, modern pose I haven't seen anywhere else.

A ring around the Nest Protect's center button illuminates gently to communicate various states that I've already talked about: light blue for setup, yellow to warn you before there's an emergency, red in a full-blown emergency, and green to let you know when everything's OK. The central button itself is large and makes a pleasant subtle click when you press it. The button alone sets the Nest Protect far from its competitors by making interacting with the device much easier than reaching for the tiny, sometimes hard-to-access button on a traditional smoke detector.

First smoke detector with an app Nest recently updated both its Android and iOS apps to work with both the Nest thermostat and Nest Protect. It's worth noting that this version 4.0 starts with a new, flatter design and seamlessly merges activities from both Nest thermostats and the Protect. If you have a Nest thermostat, the app will even let you turn off your boiler from afar when the Protect senses carbon monoxide in the house.

When I tested the smoke detector with the app, I received notification-screen, text-style push alerts when the alarm sounded and when the smoke cleared. I could also see at any given time in the office that all is clear in my home 20 miles away.

One small ding against the Nest Protect is its lack of IFTTT support. IFTTT (aka If This, Then That) is an open communication standard that lets you tie together different devices and online services. With IFTTT, you could tell the Nest Protect to send a neighbor a text message when it detect smoke and you're not home, for example, although the app does allow you to enter an emergency contact number so that it's easy to find emergency numbers when your phone receives an alarm alert. Smart-home enthusiasts have been asking for IFTTT support in Nest's thermostats for a while. I expect they'll miss it here as well, at least until Nest allows outside software makers to access its API. The company says it plans to provide that access in the first half of 2014.

When it comes down to it, outfitting the average home with a fleet of Nest Protects is a major investment: $500 to $650 to safely protect a three-bedroom home with the appropriate four or five devices. As part of a larger remodel or retrofit, however, and if you really value your time, you'll love these devices. The convenience they provide as they light your way, warn you when their batteries are dying, and calmly alert you about a variety of potential dangers will ease the pain of the cash outlay."
Viper Home review:|"

Viper is a Directed Electronics brand that makes all sorts of car-related gadgets. Recently, though, the company added a DIY home security system to the mix. That means that this new $229.99 system, dubbed Viper Home, is competing against similar products like the $349.99 Oplink Security TripleShield, $199 iSmartAlarm, $199 Canary Smart Home Security Device, and $239 Piper.

The Canary and Piper are all-in-one hubs with built-in cameras. The Oplink and iSmartAlarm, on the other hand, have hubs and separate accessories like door/window sensors and motion detectors. Viper definitely designed its home security system in the style of Oplink and iSmartAlarm. But Viper Home offers something that none of the others can -- optional integration with existing Viper vehicle security products.

Not only that, but you can buy extras like cameras and sirens a la carte and if you get a Z-Wave bridge, you can broaden the functionality of your Viper Home kit to include home automation. So, not only does Viper Home offer DIY home security, you can also incorporate vehicle security and automatable appliances -- if you so desire. That's why I think Viper Home is the most well-rounded option available among DIY security systems today.



I would recommend this system if you plan to invest in more than just the starter kit. Since iSmartAlarm is less expensive and offers roughly the same functionality, there isn't a great reason to get Viper Home instead. But, if you do plan to upgrade in any way, I wouldn't recommend iSmartAlarm or Oplink: iSmartAlarm's camera didn't do very well during our testing and Oplink's camera comes with a $19.99 monthly fee. Viper Home will cost you just $9.99 a month.

So, over time, Viper would be less expensive than Oplink and it offers a wider range of optional features. It's a particularly great option if you're interested in Viper's vehicle security offerings (or already have a Viper car security system). And if you don't care about the vehicle security options, but do want good-quality video streaming, Viper Home is $10 less a month than Oplink. If you don't want a camera or car monitoring, iSmartAlarm is still the best value around.

Design, usability, and features It seems like Viper Home paid more attention to design than Oplink or iSmartAlarm. Yes, all three are glossy white gadgets, but there's something about the Viper devices that stands out to me. And by stand out, I mean that they will blend in better with your surroundings. The hub, sensors, motion detectors, sirens, and cameras are small and carefully designed to maintain a sophisticated, yet inconspicuous presence in your home. Each item looks nice alone and blends in well with the other products. There aren't any colorful logos messing with the flow like the Oplink system or oddly inconsistent design like iSmartAlarm's line of products -- the hub is square, the sensors are squarish, and the camera is rounded -- why?

In the basic $229.99 starter kit you get a hub, a motion sensor, and a door/window sensor, along with the requisite batteries, power cord, and Ethernet cable you need to install the thing. The setup process really was painless. The hub connects directly to your router via the provided Ethernet cable and then you have to register your security system.

Next you find a good spot for the door/window sensor and the motion detector. They're equipped with adhesive strips, so that's about as simple as possible. Just find a good place in your house and stick 'em where you want (the guide offers suggestions for optimal performance). The sides of the door/window sensor should be three-quarters of an inch or closer to one another. Keep the motion detector out of direct sunlight and put it at least 72 inches off the floor. If you have a hard time reaching that high, that will likely be the biggest inconvenience you will face during this installation.

Now, it's time to download the app -- also simple. It's free and it's currently available for both Android and iOS users. Just use the log-in you created during registration and you can access the Viper Connect app. For all of the available options offered through Viper Connect, the app is incredibly straightforward and well-designed. To access the home security portion, select Home Control.

From there, you can choose among the following: Arm Away, Disarm, Arm Stay, and Panic. There's also a Status section in the bottom right corner so you can see what setting you're currently using. The Panic button won't call the police, it will actually send notifications to emergency contacts you specifically add to the system. In fact, Viper Home is not designed to contact the authorities at all. It simply lets you know when a ""security event"" occurs and then you decide how to respond. If there is a security breach of any kind, though, you will receive an e-mail sent to the address you used during registration and a notification from the app.



If you add in other features like the $149.99 camera/motion sensor, the $49.99 siren or additional door/window sensors and motion detectors you can do even more. With the camera and the $9.99 monthly fee, for example, you will receive live video alerts during security violations. And don't forget the home automation possibilities available with the addition of a Z-Wave bridge. That way, you can control a whole bunch of different home appliances from the same Viper Connect app.

Viper Home can support up to 32 users and up to 64 different devices. And the app has a history section where you can view the dates and times of specific security events and filter by user. It's easy and there are so many ways to make it work for your lifestyle.

Performance I installed the starter kit, a siren, and a camera at home. I had no issues with the system during testing -- no false alarms or inconsistent notifications to note. Every time I triggered a security event, Viper Home responded as expected.

Basically, this meant that I got to spend a lot of time trying to stealthily get past the motion detector unnoticed and open and close the window to test the sensor. Every time I got near the motion detector when the system was armed, I received an e-mail and a notification. Same goes for the door/window sensor. The camera, too, doubles as a motion detector and it absolutely refused to let me sneak into my own living room (no matter how hard I tried).

I guess it makes sense, since the motion sensors have a detection range of 39.4 feet. Also important: the siren was loud. Apparently, it can go up to 85dBA for a minute and a half after an intrusion is noted. It's surely loud enough to scare away a skittish thief.

Conclusion I am extremely happy with Viper Home. It looks good, it's easy to use, it offers a lot of features, and it works. If you are interested in a DIY security system, Viper Home is a solid competitor.

If you really care about design, the Viper Home starter kit might even be worth the extra $30 over Oplink or iSmartAlarm -- whether or not you plan to upgrade. It also depends on what sort of system suits your needs. Piper and Canary are both intriguing design-focused options. The all-in-one system is definitely more subtle and it comes with a camera to capture footage of intruders.

I can't think of any reason you should get Oplink over Viper Home. Oplink's monthly fee is $10 more and it doesn't offer anything extra that justifies the price hike. So if you do want a camera that works and will offer live streaming, Viper Home is the best bet. And, if you're interested in a security system for your home and your car, Viper vehicle security and remote start options are accessible on the same Viper Connect app. There's something appealing about having all of your security needs efficiently condensed into a single, well-designed app."
Revolv Smart Home Solution review:|"

If you've started building out a smart home, chances are you're already familiar with app and controller hub fatigue. If your smart lock, your connected LED bulbs, and your smart thermostat all come from different manufacturers, that means each has an app of some kind, and they likely don't talk with one another. Revolv Inc.'s Revolv Smart Home Solution wants to help.

The premise of the Revolv is a decent one. One hub with seven different wireless radios, all tied into a single app. Have a Nest Learning Thermostat, a network of Philips Hue bulbs, and a Yale Smart Lock or two? Revolv lets you control them all from one unified interface.

Any unifying hub must work seamlessly with a broad range of connected devices, but corralling multiple wireless standards and device software quirks into a logical interface for thousands of different products isn't easy. To Revolv's credit, it has met the challenge deftly. Of the 10 or so devices I tried, not one of them failed to work as expected.

At $299, the Revolv is no throwaway purchase. The Securifi Almond+, and the Staples Connect Hub both promise similar capability (with integrated WiFi router in the Almond+) for $99. If price is a concern, wait to see how these products and the inevitable flood of competitors turn out. Among a number of criteria these devices will need to satisfy, easy set-up and interoperability will be key. Revolv already has these nailed, and it's thus recommendable to early adopters with multiple smart devices. Every one else should hang on to see how the market develops.



The Revolv Smart Home Solution won't fit everywhere. It's not that its blank CD spindle-size body is overly large, it's more because of its red base. The smoked-plastic cover helps tone it down some, but the Revolv still looks a bit like a cartoon fire alarm. Even if you don't like its aesthetic, you can applaud the designers for requiring only a single power cable and no hard network connection. Unlike hubs for most standalone smart devices, you don't need to wire it to your existing router or cable modem.

Initial setup is also easy. You plug it in, install the app on your iOS phone (Android version coming in Q1 2014) and follow the in-app setup screens, which mostly involve holding the flash on your iOS device up to the tiny LED on top of the Revolv unit and transmitting your wireless network via Revolv's FlashLink technology. You'll need to be on a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network, and situate the Revolv within 65 feet of your router, but those are the only stringent installation requirements.

Once you're on the network, you can go about adding devices via the app.

At the moment, Revolv supports around 50 different smart devices, and only those that use Wi-Fi, the Insteon network, or Z-Wave. Its FAQ details only 26 products as of this writing, but the company tells us it has added, and continues to add, support for more devices regularly. They say it will expand to 200 devices in Q1 2014 with a coming firmware update that will enable the ZigBee radio. In addition to ZigBee support, the company says it will enable the other radios, including various 915MHz and 400MHz bands, as more devices come to market.

Part of the reason for holding off on supporting those additional standards is competitive -- the company says it doesn't want to play its full compatibility hand right now. Another reason more or less boils down to manpower and timing the launch. Revolv Inc. says it wants to precertify every device before the hub will support it to ensure a painless user experience. As a small firm, it can only ensure the experience for so many devices. Fortunately, it's focused on some of the more popular products for launch.

I've already mentioned the Nest thermostat (Nest Protect support pending), Philips' Hue bulbs, and Yale smart locks as options for the Revolv. It will also work with Belkin's WeMo smart power outlets, a variety of GE light dimmers and control kits, as well as thermostats from Trane and Honeywell (not the Honeywell WiFi Smart thermostat, yet). You can use the Revolv to drive a Sonos wireless speaker (the Play:3, Play:5, and PlayBar, specifically). It also controls many, but not all, devices in the Insteon family. Insteon LED light bulbs and a remote control worked as promised, an uncertified moisture detector didn't register.

For the Philips Hue bulbs and the Sonos kits, you will still need to use the separate hub device included for those products. Revolv tells me that it's working on a software update to help free you from that extra hardware. That's great, but along the same lines, it's hard to understand why Revolv didn't also include a WiFi router in the Revolv. The lack of a router, especially given its price, will be a competitive headache for Revolv as products like the Almond+ and others come to market in the next few months.



To add a device to the Revolv app, you click on the Hub icon on the main screen, and the scroll down to the ""plus"" symbol. That brings up the Add Devices page, which gives you three options--an automatic search feature, a screen that prompts you to interact with your device to trigger the reception signal, or a manual, typed search feature. All three functions work as you'd expect, and once you locate or trigger the device you want to add, it pops up on the primary device grid as a favorite.

Overall navigation in the app takes some getting used to. It's not too hard to figure out, but it has some redundancy. Three different screens can show your complete list of devices or your trigger-based preset commands, for example. Each list has a different function, from basic interaction to favorite organizing, but consolidation or clearer labeling would help.

The specific device control screens are easier to understand. You don't actually need to click all the way through to each individual device interface. On the main grid screen that shows your favorites, you can simply double-tap a device icon to turn it on and off. Click through and you get finer controls that vary based on the kind of device. The Nest thermostat app lets you set the temperature and switch from heating to cooling mode. You can change the brightness and the display colors on the Philips Hue bulb page.

The controls work easily enough, but they can also be a little too simplistic. On the Sonos control screen, for example, you can't make playlists, you can only adjust the volume and enter basic track commands. You can't set the Nest thermostat to away mode like you can with its dedicated app. When you design a preset that incorporates multiple Hue bulbs, you can't set them all to a standard 2,700K color temperature, you have to use one of the loud colored lighting tones. Revolv says it intends to deepen the capabilities of its in-app commands, but until that happens, you will still find yourself switching back and forth between the Revolv app and the device-specific software.

Despite those issues, on balance the software works well enough. Your network strength will determine responsiveness, and our office environment saw a few hiccups and delayed responses, but nothing show stopping, and nothing that smelled like buggy code. The interface has a few too many screens, but overall it has a minimal approach that helps make it generally easy to use. The ability to make custom presets also gives you broad programmability, and home automation enthusiasts will appreciate that you can map multiple devices to a single trigger. Triggers include GeoSense-based location activation, a scheduler, motion detector support, and basic manual entry. Advanced users will miss IFTTT support, and the scheduler could have more features (the ability to time ""off"" as well as ""on,"" with a single preset, for example). Revolv says it may add those things soon, too.

With all of the software features ""coming soon,"" I wouldn't disagree if you had a sense that Revolv has rushed this product to market to beat its competitors and take advantage of the holiday buying season. Usually ""rush to market"" translates to sloppy, though, and the Revolv definitely isn't that. The company is up-front about the present capabilities of its hub and its software, and I was genuinely surprised by how everything just worked. Even if I wish it had broader compatibility and more robust features at today's launch, it's still a competently made device with plenty to offer the smart-home enthusiast.

If you're only dabbling in smart home devices -- maybe you have a Nest thermostat and a set of Hue lights -- I wouldn't feel compelled to buy any smart home hub, although one that costs $299 like the Revolv would certainly be a harder sell. On your fourth or fifth device, though, you might reasonably want some way to centralize all of that home intelligence. The Revolv will do that for you, and it will do it well. If you need that today, and you know the Revolv will support all of your various devices, I suspect you'll be happy with it. It might even be fun to watch it add features down the road. Given the number of products coming that claim to do essentially the same things though, you might try to weather app fatigue for a few more months."
Connected by TCP Wireless LED Lighting Kit review:|"

After this review initially published, TCP cut the price of their LED kit from $169 down to $142. They also announced exclusive pricing options on their products through a partnership with Home Depot, where the kit currently sells for just $109.99. The review has been updated to reflect these pricing developments.

The smart home options just keep on coming. The latest is the Connected by TCP Wireless LED Lighting Kit, which will set you up with three LED bulbs, the ""Gateway"" hub that serves as their collective brain, and a handy remote control. Setup is a breeze -- just plug in the Gateway, screw in the bulbs, and download the free TCP app to your Android or iOS device. You'll be controlling your new lights within minutes.

As smart lighting kits go, there isn't a lot to dislike about what TCP's offering here. Each bulb gives off a very respectable 800 lumens of warm, natural-looking light, yet still manages to claim a life expectancy of 25,000 hours. The TCP app is intuitive and easy to use, even when you're programming advanced lighting scenes and schedules. The Gateway is compact and well-designed, mindful of the fact that space is at a premium on today's typical router shelf. The addition of a separate remote control is another nice touch.



This brings us to the cost. At $142.99, this lighting kit certainly doesn't come cheap -- but it's still priced quite competitively. An Insteon Hub and three of its LED bulbs will cost you at least $200, while the three-bulb Philips Hue Starter Kit will set you back $199. If you're willing to sacrifice the remote control, you can save even more money by buying TCP's LED 2-pack for $99 (it includes the Gateway, but not the remote), then adding the third bulb a la carte for $30.

Perhaps the best deal of all, though, lies with TCP's exclusive partnership with Home Depot, where the LED kit is available for just $109.99. Additional bulbs are cheaper, too, costing just $16.97 as opposed to the suggested retail price of $29.99. At those prices, this kit is an undeniably exceptional value -- no word on how long those deals will last, though.

Even at a price point of $142, TCP's kit makes a lot of sense for a budget-minded consumer interested in basic, entry-level smart lighting. However, if you want more advanced functionality from your lights, then a more powerful system might be worth the extra cash.

Bulb breakdown  As LED lights go, TCP's bulbs are definitely on the impressive end of the spectrum. You'll often see LED bulbs stretch the truth by claiming that 600 or even 400 lumens of light output makes them comparable to 60-watt incandescents, which average 880 lumens of light output. TCP bulbs, however, put out 800 lumens each, so when they say ""60-watt equivalent,"" they mean it. Also, with 11 watts of power usage, this means that TCP bulbs are putting out about 73 lumens per watt. That's a number to be proud of.

TCP bulbs glow at a color temperature of 2,700 degrees Kelvin, which gives them a warm, yellowy quality. If you're thinking about replacing your incandescents, but are worried that you'll be forced to subject yourself to cold-toned, bluish light, then you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get from TCP.

Additionally, TCP bulbs are rated to last 25,000 hours. Though 25 times better than the common incandescent, this is still a fairly average number for an LED bulb. All the same, it's a number that I'm happy with, given the above-average brightness. At three hours a day of average usage, it'll last well over 20 years before fading to 70 percent of its original brightness (the current definition of a ""dead"" LED). Even then, it'd still be shining with around 560 lumens worth of light output. Insteon's LED bulb, for comparison, starts out with a light output of 591 lumens.

TCP warrants all of their lighting kits for two years, which helps lend some credibility to their longevity claims. It's not as bold a warranty as the Cree TW Series LED, though -- with 800 lumens and a lifespan of 25,000 hours, same as TCP, Cree bulbs come with a warranty of ten years. With a bar that high, it would have been nice to see TCP put a little bit more money where its mouth is.

Another interesting thing about TCP's bulbs: they bounce. Most light bulbs...don't. It was a sad day here at CNET Appliances a few weeks ago when someone who shall remain nameless accidentally dropped one of the Philips Hue bulbs we were testing from a height of about a foot. The Philips bulb shattered, just like most light bulbs would have. If it had been a TCP bulb, however, we probably wouldn't have had a mess to clean up. Even dropping it from three feet up or higher, neither the bulb nor the hardware inside of it seem inclined to break (and believe me, we tested this over and over again -- there's something strangely satisfying about watching a light bulb bounce.)

I'm not about to sit here and criticize Philips for designing bulbs that break when you drop them, but still, I'm impressed with how durable TCP's LEDs are. Maybe you'll never drop one of their bulbs, but given how much more they cost than your standard light, it's reassuring to know that if you do, you probably won't be forced to replace it.

How about that app?  The TCP app is one of the better-designed smart home apps that I've played with. It feels polished, and the controls just make sense. This probably has something to do with the fact that it isn't new. TCP already offers a wireless CFL lighting kit that uses the same app, so they've had some time to tweak the app's user experience and work out the kinks.

From the app's main screen, you'll get a clear look at the status of all of the bulbs on your system. TCP claims that their app can control up to 250 bulbs, and that you can mix and match between the standard, A19-shaped bulbs that come in the kit and their connected CFL bulbs. You can also incorporate TCP's BR30-shaped LEDs into your system -- useful for recessed lighting setups (and again, you can currently get an even better price on these at Home Depot).

If you do opt to fill your house with TCP bulbs, you'll be able to group them into ""rooms"" to make things easier. From there, you can still control individual lights, or you can opt to take control of an entire room's worth of bulbs, dimming them up and down in tandem, or turning them all on or off at once.

The app also offers ""Smart Control"" of your lights. Using a simple interface, you'll be able to create and save specific lighting scenes, with different bulbs on, off, or dimmed to a certain level. From then on, you'll be able to return to those exact settings at the touch of a button. In addition, you can program your lights to turn on or off at different times of day, or even have them automatically sync up with sunrises and sunsets. Maybe you want your bedroom lamp to fade on when it's time to wake up -- or maybe you want the lights in your house to make it seem like you're home while you're away on vacation. TCP's app makes all of it simple, even for users who aren't necessarily technologically inclined.

One app feature that I found particularly useful: each light will flash whenever you're configuring its settings. It's a little touch, but a smart one, giving you the reassurance that you're tinkering with the right bulb when you try and change its name, or assign it to a new lighting scene.



What about features?  From the durability of the bulbs to the handy remote, the Connected by TCP Wireless LED Lighting Kit has a strong and smart design, and this carries over to its features. I was thoroughly impressed with the system's hub. Unlike most control devices that you'll find with systems like this one, TCP's Gateway is small and unobtrusive. It'd be easy to tuck it onto a shelf beside your router, and from then on, you'd probably rarely notice it.

As for that remote, it works just as you'd expect it to, with a range of about 150 feet. There are dedicated buttons for four different lights -- you can choose which lights each one controls via the app. From there, you'll be able to turn each one on and off, or dim them. You also have the option of controlling all four bulbs at once.

However, I was disappointed to learn that TCP lights aren't compatible with external control systems like the Revolv Smart Home Solution, or the Staples Connect Hub. There seems to be a smart home singularity on the horizon, with devices of all kinds joining together within unified apps and a master hub. TCP is choosing to skip that party -- it's their app and their hub, or it's nothing. Then again, perhaps it makes sense for them to wait until we have a better idea of much appeal these master hubs actually have, or which one consumers are most drawn towards.

Also, TCP might struggle to compete with other smart lighting options due to the fact that they really aren't offering anything unique. If you want an automatable LED lighting system, you have a few options capable of doing exactly what TCP's kit will do. If you want those lights to change colors, however, you'll need to go with a Philips Hue kit (or with soon-to-be-released bulbs like iLumi, LIFX, or the Lumen LED Color Smart Bulb). If you want your lights to be part of larger, more complete home automation system, you'll need a system like Insteon or Nexia. That's a lot of competition offering to do a lot of things that TCP just can't.

But maybe the only feature that matters to you is price. At $142 or less, TCP's LED kit is positioned well to compete with more elaborate, more feature-rich setups by offering quality smart bulbs at an affordable price. For many consumers, this might be the smartest feature of all.

Are these the right lights for me?  If you're interested in automated lighting that isn't a pain to program, then they very well may be. In my tests, TCP's system worked flawlessly, and programming specific scenes or schedules was a cinch. The Gateway features an attractive, space-conscious design, the remote control was nice to have, and the bulbs were surprisingly sturdy. Best of all, those bulbs offer a very strong quality of light that I think most consumers would find very appealing.

Still, if you're already willing to spend over $100 on a lighting system for your home, I wouldn't blame you for being tempted by the Philips Hue Starter Kit. Even brushing aside the obvious novelty of a color-changing light, you'll still be getting access to fun features like geofencing and IFTTT compatibility. The question is whether or not those extra features are worth the extra $60, and for a lot of consumers, they probably will be. Whether or not they're worth an extra $90 is more difficult to say. That Home Depot price point is an awfully good deal.

Philips comparisons aside, the Connected by TCP Wireless LED Lighting Kit is a simple smart home solution that stands on its own merits. With its high-quality hardware, intuitive app, and appealing price point, it might be one of the most attractive entry-level smart lighting options currently available. If you're a value-minded, novelty-averse consumer who's been waiting for a simpler smart lighting alternative, then this could be the kit you've been holding out for."
Oplink Security TripleShield review:|"

As DIY security becomes more and more popular, we're seeing more and more options arrive on the market. The latest offerings come from Oplink Security: the $199.99 sensor-driven AlarmShield package, and the $349.99 TripleShield package, which adds a pair of wireless cameras for the surveillance-minded homeowner. With similar motion detectors, panic sirens, and contact sensors for doors and windows -- not to mention equivalent price levels for both the basic package and the camera-ready package -- Oplink seems ready to compete directly with iSmartAlarm.

The big difference between the two systems is that, unlike iSmartAlarm, Oplink charges monthly fees to use its products. The TripleShield package starts at $19.99 per month. This is still a lot less than what you'll likely spend on an established home security brand requiring professional installation, and you won't need to commit to any long-term contracts, but it's still a bit tough to justify given how similar Oplink's packages are to what iSmartAlarm is offering.



That said, Oplink offers a few distinct advantages over iSmartAlarm that might help certain consumers stomach those monthly fees. First, we like Oplink's cameras a lot better, and Oplink's package gives you two of them as opposed to the single camera you'll get from iSmartAlarm. If you're a surveillance-minded homeowner who wants to keep an eye on things around the house, Oplink's fees might be worth it. Second, Oplink offers the option of backing your system up with a cellular connection that'll keep you online if your wireless network goes out. You'll need to purchase an $80 USB modem, then pay an additional $9.99 per month on top of what you're already paying, but all the same, I think that some consumers will be happy to have the extra peace of mind.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the TripleShield package retails for $349 online, the same price as iSmartAlarm's camera-ready Premium Package -- but it'll sell for $299 at major retail outlets.

Those advantages aside, I'm not convinced that Oplink has enough of an edge over iSmartAlarm for most users to consider it the superior value. I was pleased with how well the system performed, and I'd feel secure having it protecting my home, but I'd hate paying those fees every month, especially knowing that I'd be getting comparable results from iSmartAlarm. Unless you have a specific interest in the admittedly nifty Oplink cameras, I think iSmartAlarm is the smarter choice. If a cellular backup is what's truly important to you, you might also want to check out SimpliSafe -- its base packages are slightly more expensive and it doesn't offer cameras, but its $14.99 monthly fee is lower than Oplink's, with a cellular backup included.

Smart, usable features The TripleShield package comes packed in a neat little kit, and literally can be installed within minutes. Just plug the Optical Processing Unit (OPU) into your home's router, download the free Oplink app (available for iOS, Android, and Windows devices), and start placing your sensors wherever you want. With sticky pads for the contact sensors and simple mounting kits for the panic siren, motion detector, and cameras, this won't take very long at all. Once you've got your system set up, you'll be able to rename each sensor -- an important step toward making alerts more helpful and meaningful.

After plugging in the two cameras and connecting them with your network, you'll need to wait a few minutes before they begin broadcasting live video to your phone. Once they do, playback within the app is smooth and simple to work with. You'll be able to watch multiple feeds at once in a split screen, or focus on one camera. Oplink's cameras record audio as well as video, so you'll be able to listen in if you like -- don't expect high-fidelity sound, though.

One of the Oplink system's coolest features is that the cameras will automatically switch into night vision when the light gets low enough. Even if it's the middle of the night and your living room is pitch black, Oplink's cameras can still see what's going on -- and so can you. Another key camera feature: if the alarm is ever triggered, the cameras on your network will automatically record 30 seconds of video, starting 5 seconds before the alarm (it keeps a small portion of footage in memory), then save it to the system's hard drive. From within the Oplink app, you'll be able to view a timeline of alerts with corresponding videos showing you what happened. You'll even be able to e-mail these videos out at the touch of a button -- handy information for the police, or your insurance provider.

The TripleShield package comes with a 16GB USB flash drive that connects to the OPU, serving as the storage space for your video. Along with a la carte sensors, you can purchase additional sensors, too. If you decide to purchase extra cameras, keep in mind that each one will add $5 to your monthly Oplink fees.

Conspicuous design When it comes to DIY security kits that involve multiple, networked sensors, it's hard to find much differentiation from brand to brand. The motion detectors and contact sensors all look more or less the same -- semiugly white plastic that will definitely stick out amid your decor. If you're more interested in a security option that's designed to blend into your surroundings, you'll probably want to go with an all-in-one unit like Canary or Piper.

Still, if you compare Oplink with a brand like iSmartAlarm, you'll find a couple of key design differences. For one, the mothership of Oplink's setup, the OPU router, is decidedly less attractive than the iSmartAlarm's slick-looking CubeOne. Granted, iSmartAlarm clearly poached much of its design from the Apple playbook, but still, I'd much rather have the CubeOne sitting on my shelf than the ugly, modem-esque OPU. Also, the Oplink contact sensors are bigger and bulkier than the iSmartAlarm sensors. This might seem like a trivial nitpick when it comes to security, but if you want the system that'll leave the smallest footprint in your home's design aesthetic, I think you'll find better options than Oplink.



Oplink's cameras also take a different design approach than iSmartAlarm's iCamera. With Oplink, you get a pair of compact cameras that mount easily on bases if needed, making it easy to stash them away on a bookshelf or a windowsill. I like this approach better than the iCamera, which looks great, but also takes up too much space.

Another small differentiation point between the two systems: Oplink offers a dedicated panic siren that you can place wherever you like. iSmartAlarm, on the other hand, integrates its system's siren into the CubeOne. This means that you have one fewer gizmo to configure, but it also means that you don't get as much flexibility about where to place your siren, since the CubeOne needs to remained hooked up to your home's router.

Reliable performance If you're spending money on home security, you're going to want a system that you can depend on. In my home testing, I found that Oplink meets the mark. My system performed exactly how I wanted it to, always alerting me when I (intentionally) tripped the alarm, and never once sending me a false alert. The sensors all seemed perfectly sensitive, too. I tried slowly sneaking past the motion detector, for instance, but I wasn't able to fool it.

Still, a Wi-Fi-based security system is only as secure as your network coverage. If the Wi-Fi in your home drops out, so will your system. This is where the argument for a cellular backup comes into play, and Oplink deserves credit for offering one when iSmartAlarm does not. But the fact that you'll need to spend an extra $80 on a Oplink-approved 3G modem, along with an extra $9.99 each month, is a little hard to swallow.

In the event that something does trigger your alarm, you'll receive an alert on your smartphone, as well as an e-mail notification detailing which specific sensor was tripped and when. You can also program your system to alert additional emergency contacts. Like iSmartAlarm, Oplink doesn't currently offer live monitoring, and leaves it up to you whether or not an alert merits calling the police. This can help you avoid wasting police resources with false alerts, but some users will understandably prefer a system with live operators capable of contacting the authorities on their behalf.

Conclusion  Oplink has designed a easy-to-operate DIY security system that performs well. Its cameras are particularly impressive, standing as an appealing alternative to iSmartAlarm's frustratingly glitchy iCamera. Still, when you put the two systems side by side, it's hard to see much value with Oplink. A $199 iSmartAlarm system (sans iCamera) will work just fine for small home or apartment security, and you won't be paying monthly fees in the process.

Oplink is smart to take advantage of the growing trend of DIY home security. However, I just wish that the company had brought a little more to the table in order to justify its pricing strategy and compete with the fee-free iSmartAlarm. As it stands, I can only recommend the TripleShield package for consumers with a strong enough interest in home surveillance that they're willing to spend at least $19.99 per month for those cameras. For everyone else interested in DIY home security, I still think iSmartAlarm is the better way to go."
Philips adds BR30 bulbs to Hue smart LED line|"



Philips seems to have its Hue smart light bulbs on an ever-expanding trajectory. The newest entrant: the BR30 Connected Downlight Lamp, available as either a standalone bulb for $59, or in a set of three for $199, which includes the Hue Bridge wireless hub.

Other than their bulb design, the smart home basics of these BR30 lights are similar to those of the original Hue Connected Bulb. Connect the Hue Bridge to your wireless network, and then use your smartphone or tablet to control the bulbs with the Philips Hue app. Programming options include an expansive range of colors, from traditional light bulb hues to more outlandish reds, blues, and greens. You can also tell the lights to behave according to an alarm, a timer, or even your GPS-based physical location.

Where the original Hue bulbs have an omnidirectional design, though, the BR30 and its shrouded bottom portion is geared towards down-facing, recessed lighting fixtures and interior spotlights. They also get a brightness bump, going from 600 lumens in the originals to 630 lumens here. I already found the original Hue sufficiently bright and accurate to more-or-less replace a standard 60-watt incandescent. Given their specs and Philips' earlier success, I expect the BR30's will be similarly comparable with traditional 65-watt BR30 spotlights.

These are not the only LED spotlights on the market. Cree, GE, and even Philips, all offer non-smart alternatives for just a little over $10. I'm also curious to see the width of the spotlight beam compared with traditional BR30 bulbs. We'll have a hands-on review soon, but on paper these lights seem like a worthy, logical addition to the Hue family. As with the other Hue bulbs, the price tag will make these hard to justify as a casual purchase, but smart home enthusiasts and fans of novelty tech products should appreciate them. You can buy them today via Amazon and the Apple store. A European GU10 version of the Hue BR30 bulbs lands overseas today as well, and comes to the US in December."
Lumen LED Color Smart Bulb review:|"

In an age where people are starting to expect more from their lights, we've already seen Philips offer wireless color controls for its Hue LED bulbs, not to mention some competition from crowdfunded upstarts like Lifx and iLumi.  Now, Lumenation wants to get in on the fun with the Lumen LED Color Smart Bulb, a color-changing bulb from Tabu that you can control right from your smartphone over Bluetooth 4.0.

At a suggested retail price of $69.99, the Lumen definitely doesn't come cheap, although it does cost $20 less than what you'll pay if you preorder a bulb from Lifx or iLumi. As for Philips, a single Hue bulb will cost you $59.99, but if you want to use it, you'll need a Hue Bridge, which Philips only sells as part of the $199.95 Hue Starter Pack. Granted, with three smart bulbs in the box, the Hue Starter Kit offers a better price per bulb than any of the current competitors. For one or two bulbs, though, Lumen bulbs look like they might be a smart, affordable alternative -- just so long as you aren't expecting anything more than the most basic controls over the look of your light.



How basic? Think of the currently emerging crop of smart lighting options as a high school advanced-placement class. The Lumen is your average C-student -- smart enough to earn a passing grade in a competitive environment, but not special enough to really stand out from the crowd. The bulb itself looks futuristic, but only in the same way that countless other LED bulbs look futuristic. The Lumen app boasts a simple interface and easy-to-use controls, but it lacks any sort of advanced, distinctive features or creative flourishes. It screams ""knockoff"" just as loudly as the sad approximation of Tony the Tiger that you'll find on a store-brand box of Frosted Flakes.

Of course, some people prefer the value of store-brand knockoffs, and to an extent, there's value in Lumen bulbs, too. The light does what it promises, changing colors on demand, and if this is all you're looking for from a smart bulb, then look no further. As for the rest of the Lumen's features -- the presets, the wake-up light scheduling, proximity detection, and so on -- all of them felt like they were developed just enough so that Lumenation could say it had developed them. Lumenation earns its completion grade with a working product, but won't be scoring extra credit anytime soon.

Still, wobbly metaphors aside, some people will see advantages to using Lumen bulbs as opposed to pricier, more established products. Unlike Philips Hue bulbs, which connect to the Hue Bridge over a ZigBee mesh network, Lumen bulbs speak directly with your smartphone or tablet over a low-energy Bluetooth connection. This means that setup is as simple as downloading the Lumen app, screwing in your bulb, and turning on your lamp.

Since the Lumen bulb relies on Bluetooth 4.0, it's only compatible with recently released iOS devices (iPhone 4 and iPad 2 users are out of luck). If you have a Bluetooth 4.0-enabled Android device, you'll be able to use Lumen bulbs just as soon as Lumenation releases the Android version of its app, which it promises will happen by the end of 2013. I won't blame you if you hold off on ordering until it makes good on this promise.

Once you've paired your bulb with your device, you'll be able to turn it on and off remotely, change its color, or launch one of the those aforementioned presets. These aren't nearly as numerous or customizable as what you'll get with Philips -- you're limited to two color cycles (the cool-toned ""Relaxation Mode"" and the warm-toned ""Romance Mode""), along with both a fast and slow version of ""Party Mode,"" which strobes red, blue, and green light in succession. Ideally, you'd be able to select your own combination of colors and the speed at which they'd cycle, but the Lumen app doesn't offer this level of functionality yet.

As for good, old-fashioned, normal-colored light, the Lumen uses a dedicated white LED capable of giving off 400 lowercase lumens, making it comparable to a 40-watt incandescent bulb. This isn't quite as bright as I'd like -- Philips Hue bulbs, for comparison, give off 600 lumens each. Switch from white light to colored light, and things will get slightly dimmer still. As an accent, it does a fine job, but don't rely on the Lumen to serve as your primary light source.



Lumenation claims that each bulb will last up to 30,000 hours. That's an impressive number, given that Philips Hue bulbs are only rated to last 15,000 hours, but keep in mind that Philips Hue bulbs come with a two-year warranty. It's unclear whether or not Lumen bulbs, on the other hand, come with any warranty at all. I know I'd feel a lot better about that 30,000-hour lifespan claim if they did.

At its brightest, the Lumen bulb only uses 7 watts of electricity, which comes out to a very efficient 57 lumens per watt. It'll also draw a little bit of juice to power the Bluetooth connection with your phone, but since it's a low-energy Bluetooth 4.0 connection, this should only be a marginal amount. All of this is to say that the math adds up on this bulb, which makes for some much-needed reassurance given that the Lumen doesn't come from a trusted, well-known lighting brand.

That said, the strength of the Lumen's hardware is actually a bit bittersweet, given that the software is so much of a weakness by comparison. A smart bulb like this just begs for automation scheduling, but all the Lumen app offers is the underwhelming wake-up mode. The potential is there for conditional, if/then statement-based automation, too -- something we've already seen with the happy marriage between Hue bulbs and IFTTT. But again, the Lumen app falls short, only offering an underdeveloped proximity mode and an incoming call mode that doesn't seem to work all that well.

The bright side to all of this is that apps can get better, and hopefully Lumen's app will do just that and will catch up to its bulb in the process. Fortunately, along with the upcoming Android release, Lumenation is promising major app improvements, including a revamped proximity mode and even a music-syncing feature. If and when those features arrive, the $69.99 Lumen LED bulb might be a tempting way for the color-curious to dip their feet into smart-bulb waters. If you're looking to control more than two bulbs, though, you're probably better off just springing for a Philips Hue Starter Kit."
Kwikset Kevo review:|"

This review was adjusted on October 31st in light of confirmed physical vulnerabilities in the Kevo's deadbolt. We're working on a revised video as well, so please stay tuned.

Keys. Who needs 'em?

Not the Kwikset Kevo, that's for sure. With the Kevo (licensed out from UniKey), you'll be able to unlock your deadbolt just by tapping on it, thanks to the built-in Bluetooth 4.0 capable of detecting the smartphone in your pocket. Don't have a smartphone? Don't worry about it -- the Kevo comes with a handy keychain fob that'll let you tap your way inside, too. You can even use the free Kevo app to send friends and loved ones ""eKeys"" to let them in when you're not around. And for purists, rest assured that the Kevo still functions like a standard mechanical lock, with keys and everything.



This idea of smartening up our deadbolts is something we've heard a lot about for the past year or so, with upcoming products like the Lockitron, August, and Goji striking it big through crowdfunding and good old-fashioned word of mouth. But talk is cheap, and smart locks are expensive -- $219, in the Kevo's case, about seven times the cost of a standard Kwikset deadbolt. Is kissing our keys goodbye really worth such a price?

I certainly wasn't convinced that it was -- but then, I got my hands on a Kevo to try out for myself. After installing, calibrating, and testing the thing out, I was thoroughly impressed by how strongly the Kevo performed. That said, a smart lock is still a lock, and as brainy a deadbolt as the Kevo is, I wish that it were a bit brawnier, too. Despite being bump-proof and essentially pick-proof, our tests confirmed that the Kwikset SmartKey deadbolt that makes up the guts of the Kevo is vulnerable to certain types of simple forced entry.

As such, if you're looking for the strongest, safest lock on the market, I think you'll want to look elsewhere. But, if you want a lock that's loaded with convenient functionality and an undeniable cool factor, then look no further.

It's the little things Tapping your way into your home has some clear appeal, especially if you're carrying an armful of groceries. Surprisingly, some of the Kevo's best features are its least noticeable.

First, Kwikset seems to have eschewed the kinds of design touches emblematic of an expensive device, and considering the fact that this is likely going to sit on the outside of your home, I'd say that's wise. I'm not sure that I'd feel comfortable bolting a conspicuously fancy appliance to my front door, as you will be if you go with a lock like the Goji. Unlike those kinds of sleek, modern, space-age-y smart locks, the Kevo looks like any other boring deadbolt. By not advertising itself as a pricey piece of hardware, it isn't likely to draw unwanted attention to your front door.

You can only really tell this lock is special when you touch it. When that happens, a ring of blue LED lights will spin around the lock, indicating that it's thinking about whether or not to grant you entry. If it detects your phone or your fob's presence, the lights will turn green and the lock will open (if you're locking it, the lights will turn yellow.) If your phone or fob is too far away for the Kevo to key in on its precise signal, the lights will turn magenta, telling you to stand a bit closer and try again.

The magenta lights mark another subtle, yet strong design feature. They'll only appear if the Kevo is certain that you're outside. If it thinks there's even a chance that you're inside your home, it'll only show the spinning blue LEDs, then nothing. Why is this important? Let's say you're inside the house and someone unsavory is at your door. If not for the inside/outside distinction, they could simply tap the lock, see the magenta lights, and know that you're nearby inside. It's a little touch that highlights Kwikset's commitment to your privacy and security.

Calibration is key The Kevo determines whether you're inside or outside your home thanks to a clever calibration process that teaches the lock how to make the distinction. It's perhaps the Kevo's most crucial feature -- without it, leaving your phone sitting on a table near the front door would mean that anybody with skin could waltz up to your stoop and unlock your deadbolt. It's the number-one thing that I wanted to test out, and thankfully, it's a feature that works flawlessly. I tested it again and again, from every conceivable angle, and not once did the Kevo unlock when I didn't want it to. Kwikset errs on the side of safety here -- you'll basically have to stand right on your doormat in order for it to reliably recognize you 100 percent of the time. Take a step to the left or a step to the right, and that number will drop to 80 or 90 percent. Leave your phone inside, even right up next to the door, and it drops to 0 percent.

According to Kwikset's instructions, calibrating the indoor/outdoor detection seems like it should be painless enough -- just tap the calibrate button on the indoor side of the lock, hold your device against the lock for a few seconds, then step outside. The lock will glow green, and, with the phone or fob that you're calibrating in your pocket, you'll simply tap the lock three times. That's it.

Except that really isn't it. After those three taps, the lock will either flash green for a successful calibration, or red for an unsuccessful one. As simple a process as it sounds, it took me about a dozen attempts to get it right. I tried doing it with my phone in my pocket, as instructed. Red flash. I tried holding the phone up in the air. Red flash. I tried stepping back as far away from the lock as I could. Red flash. Nothing seemed to work. Finally, I tried it with my phone tucked into my shirt pocket, putting it at roughly an even height with the lock, and this got me the green flash.

I spoke with some of the folks at Kwikset about this, and they acknowledged that calibrating can take multiple attempts to get right. They're aware that it probably isn't as easy as it should be, and to their credit, they've done about as good a job as they can of managing the issue. The Kevo's manual is very clear about the importance of calibrating, and it walks you through the process with illustrated step-by-step instructions, warning you outright that you might need to try repositioning the phone a few times in order to see green. If, after multiple attempts, you can't get it to work, there's also a number you can call for help. Additionally, all of these step-by-step instructions are located conveniently within the Kevo app.

About that app...  Once you're up and running, you can use the Kevo app to send eKeys to friends, family, and anyone else who may require entry into your home. These eKeys are really just an e-mail message instructing them on how to download the Kevo app and authorize their phones to open your lock. You'll be able to see when people ""accept"" the eKeys you send out, and you'll also be able to see when everyone is coming and going on a handy timeline. If needed, you'll also be able to delete or temporarily disable those eKeys, too.

However, unlike with some other smart locks, you won't be able to send out eKeys that only work at a certain time, or that automatically expire on a certain date. You'll need to manage all of that manually, which is a little bit disappointing. Also a bummer: each eKey you send out after the first one will cost $1.99. This doesn't bother me that much -- after all, that's about what you'd pay to get a normal key copied. Still, copying a normal key requires parts and labor. Charging for eKeys is just something that Kwikset does because, well, it can.

Another minor quibble is that your iPhone will vibrate and make the ""new mail"" sound whenever you activate the lock. I like feeling that buzz in my pocket and knowing that the process is working, but the app doesn't currently offer a way to change the sound, or mute it completely. Look for that to change in the near future as the app gets updated.

All that said, my favorite part of the app is that you can sort of forget about it. Unless you're managing multiple eKeys, you can safely store it out of sight in a folder once you're all set up, because you won't ever need to run it in order to open your lock. Your phone can be asleep in your pocket, and as long as you have Bluetooth turned on, it'll work with the Kevo.

The app looks stylish, but it isn't quite as intuitive as I'd like. I found myself getting a bit lost looking for specific functions, unable to remember which icon to press in order to find my way. It's the kind of thing that I'm sure you'd get used to with repeated use, but as I just wrote, I'm not sure that I'd be using the app all that regularly. To be fair, this also means that the app's ease of use really isn't that big of a deal, at least not to someone like me.



Because the Kevo lock isn't connected to the Internet, you also can't use the app to control it remotely like you can with other smart locks. If my friends called me while I was at work and needed to get into my place for some reason, I wouldn't be able to unlock the door for them through the app. I could send them an eKey, but if they don't have a smartphone with Bluetooth 4.0, they're out of luck.

That brings us to the true elephant in the room. Since the Kevo relies on Bluetooth 4.0, it currently only works with compatible iOS devices (iPhone 4S and newer, iPad 3 and newer, or the fifth-generation iPod Touch). Android 4.3, BlackBerry 10.1, and many other smartphone operating systems don't use compatible Bluetooth hardware, so they can't use the Kevo. That's an awful lot of people left locked out.

Kwikset's people say that they hope Bluetooth 4.0 will expand to these devices soon, and as soon as it does, they promise to be ready shortly thereafter. In the meantime, they suggest that slighted Android users simply use the key fob for touch-to-open entry, then migrate to their phones as soon as the hardware becomes available. We'll see how that plays, but I suspect it'll end up sending a fair deal of business toward the Lockitron, Goji, and August -- all three of which are supposed to support both iOS and Android devices.

Modern smarts, same old parts The heart of the Kevo is Kwikset's SmartKey deadbolt, which has been around for a few years now as an upgrade over the standard Kwikset deadbolt. The SmartKey uses a unique horizontal slider in place of the classic pin and tumbler setup, and this means that lock can't be bumped. The SmartKey deadbolt is also notoriously difficult to pick, boasting top certification from Underwriters Laboratories, the third party organization that tests how resistant locks are to being picked.

However, the SmartKey's horizontal slider creates some new vulnerabilities, too. Unlike standard locks, the SmartKey deadbolt is particularly susceptible to certain forced entry methods involving common tools like screwdrivers, tension wrenches, and blank keys. In today's age, there's no more ""security by obscurity."" These techniques are out there on the internet for anyone to research, and unlike lockpicking, they don't take much skill or practice to execute correctly. A thief will need to know that you've got a SmartKey deadbolt before arriving at your door, which might be a bit far-fetched, but still, it's a legitimate concern.

Still, Kwikset has a lot of confidence in their SmartKey deadbolt, and are quick to note that almost every lock is vulnerable to some sort of forced entry. I agree with this to an extent, though for over $200, I think it's fair to expect a lock that's more secure than the average deadbolt. Still, I appreciate the Kevo's multiple layers of digital encryption, as well as the SmartKey deadbolt's very cool rekeying technology, which will let you manually alter the lock to fit a new key in just a few minutes, with no need to remove it from the door or call a locksmith. If you want your new Kevo deadbolt to work with the same key you use for the knob lock, or if you want to change the lock so your creepy ex-roommate's key won't work, then you're in luck.

Like many Kwikset locks, the Kevo is available in three common exterior finishes -- Satin Nickel, Polished Brass, and Venetian Bronze -- so you shouldn't have any trouble matching it to your door's decor. As for the interior half of the lock, it's definitely larger than a standard deadbolt (after all, it has to house the Kevo's motherboard, along with the batteries that keep it powered). The size wouldn't bother me, but for some, it might be too much of an interior footprint. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Kwikset try and shrink the design down a bit for the next generation of Kevo deadbolts.

Kwikset also knows how to make locks that are easy to install, and the Kevo is no exception. You don't need to be Bob Vila to get this thing into your door -- all you'll need is a screwdriver and about 15 minutes, tops. The Kevo is designed to easily adjust to doors of different thicknesses, so if you aren't sure how thick your door is, you'll want to grab some measuring tape, too.

Service and maintenance  The Kevo runs on four AA batteries, which come included and should last about a year before you need to replace them. When the batteries are running low, you'll receive notifications within the app, and the lock itself will also flash red. The key fob also has a flashing light that'll let you know when its CR2025 battery is running low.

In the event that you lose your phone, you can log on to Kevo's Web portal and delete it from the lock. You can also initiate a hard reset on the lock itself. You'll need to use the key or the key fob to control the lock until you find your phone or replace it. If you need to replace a key fob, or if you'd like an additional one, they're available for purchase as standalone accessories directly from Kwikset.

The Kevo comes with a lifetime warranty on the mechanics and finish of the deadbolt, along with a one-year warranty on the lock's electric components.

Conclusion $219 is a lot to pay for a deadbolt, and I can already hear the jokes about keys never needing to have their batteries replaced. But the Kwikset Kevo is much more than just a novelty. It's a step forward. It's the kind of device that makes us reimagine what technology can bring to our daily lives. And yes, it's downright cool.

This is why it's such a shame that Kwikset didn't opt to upgrade the deadbolt itself for a higher level of security against forced entry. It's a smart lock, maybe the smartest we've seen yet. But I can't say that I'd call it a strong lock, and for the money you'll spend on it, that's more than a little bit disappointing -- certainly enough so to warrant holding out and seeing what August and Goji have to offer."
Click & Grow Smart Flowerpot: Smart gardening for everyone (hands-on)|"



Editors' note, March 26, 2014: Updated with results of long-term testing.

We've noticed some recent activity on Reddit regarding the $79 Click & Grow Smart Flowerpot. If you recall, we received one back in October and said we'd update you when we had something to report. And after five months of testing, we finally have some results to share.

As a quick refresher, Click & Grow's Smart Flowerpot started out as a Kickstarter project. It boasts ""smart soil"" that's supposed to maintain the correct pH level -- it even automatically distributes water as needed. Basically, it's designed to make the activity of growing plants as hands-off as possible. Simply add four AA batteries, refill the water tank once a month, and expect a full-size chili pepper plant in two to four months (tomato, basil, cockscomb, and strawberry plants are some other options).

Since most of us in the CNET Appliances office have limited gardening experience, we were intrigued by the prospect of a low-maintenance indoor insta-plant. Even so, we kept a pretty close eye on it, making sure it had access to light and that the grow light accessory was on during gloomy winter days.

We did notice sprouts in about two weeks and ,much to our delight, it even flourished for a few months and began to flower. Unfortunately, something happened around the four-month mark. Instead of yielding red chili peppers as the timeline on Click & Grow's site suggested it would, we got something much more sinister: spider mites.

Now, I have to add that we're only mostly sure that these things are, in fact, spider mites. I'll let you gardening experts weigh in below, but either way, some sort of critter colony took over our once-healthy chili pepper plant and totally destroyed it. Given that these mites are really tiny, we didn't know what was happening until it was too late.

Here's a snippet from Click & Grow's FAQ, responding to the question, ""Are Click & Grow plants organic?"" The answer: ""There are no pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, plant hormones, or any other suspicious substances in our products. And there's no need for them -- a well-watered and fed plant with perfect growing conditions can defend itself without any outside help.""

I'm not sure about ""perfect growing conditions,"" but we made every effort to keep this plant alive and it still met with an untimely end. So, while the Click & Grow pot does have sensors that alert you if the water level is low, and such, a plant is still just a plant and it's still vulnerable to factors beyond the purview of Click & Grow's tech. The built-in sensors definitely make the whole plant-growing process more hands-off, but we aren't convinced that this Smart Flowerpot is more likely to deliver a full-size chili pepper plant than sticking seeds in a regular ol' pot and hoping for the best. We will be testing a Click & Grow Smart Herb Garden too, so more gardening stuff is heading your way soon.

Original post:

You might think that $79 is a lot of money to pay for a flowerpot. For an ordinary flowerpot, you would be correct. The Click & Grow Smart Flowerpot, with its sensor and specially designed soil, is hardly ordinary.

I received the Smart Flowerpot about a week and a half ago and I've been dying to try it out. Why the excitement? I have a confession to make.

I kill plants.

I don't mean to kill them. I have lovingly nurtured basil, bell peppers, tomatoes, sage, thyme, and a few very unlucky grocery store orchids. Despite my best efforts, they all met the same doom. I'm the problem. Overwatering, underwatering, and incorrect lighting have led me to frantic sessions of Googling how to resuscitate a chive plant. To no avail. As a result, I can't help but experience intense jealousy whenever my friends post photos to Instagram of their bus-sized rosemary plants with captions like, ""I guess I might be OK at this whole gardening thing after all.""

I suspect I'm not alone.



For those of you who lack green thumbs, those of you like me, Click & Grow offers hope. The company wants to remove you from the growing equation almost entirely.

Click & Grow first appeared on my radar when I was conducting research for a smart-gardening roundup that included both the Click & Grow Smart Flowerpot and Herb Garden. The company impressed me again with the announcement of its latest product, the Smart Farm. In case you're not following its progress, Click & Grow seeks to change the way we view gardening.

Click & Grow couples sensor technology, its patented nanotech growth medium, and programmed, automatic watering to make gardening a complete no-brainer. In fact, the company claims that with its products, anyone can be a gardener. Given my track record, I'm anxious to put that claim to the test. If the growing process is anything like the setup, I might be on easy street. After adding water to the reservoir, and plugging in four AA batteries, the packaging tells me I can basically do nothing and expect perfect chili peppers within four months.

In addition to the Smart Flowerpot's sleek design, I appreciate that it is reusable. When your basil plant fades, as all things must, you can order another seed cartridge and begin the process anew. Click & Grow offers $20 refill cartridges ranging from mini tomatoes to painted nettles, to lemon balm, thyme, or sugar leaf, just to name a few. The company says more are on the way. Given the cost of herbs at the supermarket, a Smart Flowerpot could pay for itself in short order.

You may wonder how long those batteries will last. Click and Grow states that the four required AA batteries will last eight to 12 months. Rechargeable batteries will work just as well, if you're interested in reducing your energy use further. The time seems reasonable and I hope to be able to substantiate that claim. Along with growth updates, I'll be sure to keep you posted on battery life as well.

This is an ongoing hands-on. As the plant grows and matures, I'll add to this and let you know how the product is doing. I have high hopes for the Smart Flowerpot. Or, maybe, I just really like the idea of having fresh chili peppers at work. Either way, I'm excited to see if Click & Grow is right about anybody being a gardener. Stay tuned for updates about the Smart Flowerpot's performance."
Bring your deadbolt to life with Lockitron|"



Most of us lock and unlock our doors each and every day, so why not smarten the whole process up? That's the idea behind the Lockitron, the intriguing gadget from Mountain View, Calif.-based startup Apigy. For a current preorder price of $179, the Lockitron promises to turn almost any deadbolt into a smart lock after less than a minute of installation.

Using a free smartphone app (available for iOS and Android devices) users will be able to tell the Lockitron to lock and unlock the door remotely -- perfect for letting someone in from afar, or double-checking to make sure you didn't leave the door unlocked by mistake. In addition, Lockitron comes complete with an NFC (near-field communication) tag that will toggle the state of the lock whenever it's tapped by an NFC-enabled Android phone. Stuck with one of those horrible, NFC-less iPhones? Don't worry, because you'll have the similarly cool ability to connect your phone to the Lockitron over Bluetooth, then trigger the lock just by approaching it.

Owners of older phones can also control their deadbolts by sending the Lockitron a text message, but for that to work, they'll need to pay a $5-per-month fee. (If your phone is too old to send text messages, then maybe it's time for an upgrade -- though I'm guessing you get that a lot.)

Locking down the market Despite being rejected from Kickstarter when the site decided not to allow home improvement products, Lockitron's developers were still able to crowdfund over $2 million dollars directly through their own Web site, so there's clearly a demand for these kinds of futuristic locks. Unsurprisingly, the smart-lock space has become a rather crowded one in the year since, with new competitors emerging like the August, the Goji, and the Kevo, not to mention existing automatable locks from established names like Schlage. The big question here is, what has Lockitron done to stand out?

Locking and unlocking the door remotely isn't a unique feature, and neither is the option to share temporary access with someone like a pet sitter or a house cleaner. Even the NFC compatibility is something that certain existing companies, like Yale, are already using for some residential locks, and other locks that use fob-based entry are basically offering the same thing. The Lockitron won't take a picture of whoever it is at your door, the way that Goji will, and it doesn't offer a complete built-in lock, like the Kevo. As for looks, the Lockitron isn't ugly (the sheer simplicity of the thing will likely appeal to minimalists), but I have to admit that it looks a little bit clunky next to a sleek-looking device like the August.

Still, compared with the competition, Lockitron does seem to have a wider range of usability built right into it, especially when it comes to compatibility, and this will likely make it the most appealing smart lock for a lot of consumers. No matter what kind of phone you use, whether it's an iPhone, an Android device, a BlackBerry, or even an old flip phone you've stubbornly been clinging to, you'll be able to control the Lockitron with it. iOS and Android users will get the most bang for their buck, but people with other kinds of phones won't be left locked out, either. Other smart locks are designed exclusively for smartphone users, and some -- like the currently iOS-exclusive Kevo -- are even narrower than that.

How smart are these smart locks? Another unique feature that the Lockitron boasts is a built-in accelerometer. If someone knocks on your door, the Lockitron should be able to detect the vibrations, then send you a text alert on your phone. We saw a similar feature with Schlage's Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt, which could be programmed to sound an alarm if it sensed someone trying to break your door down. I can see a lot of usefulness there, but also wonder if such a setup might be prone to false alerts.

More worrisome is the fear of false unlocks -- though to be fair, this applies to all of these new devices. Suppose you have your iPhone paired with the Lockitron over Bluetooth. The door unlocks automatically as you approach, which is an awesome feature if you're carrying two armfuls of groceries in from the car. What about when you're already home, though? If you leave your phone on a table by the door, will the Lockitron get confused? If someone knocks and you approach to answer with your phone in your pocket, will the door go ahead and unlock before you want it to? How does it tell if you're inside the house as opposed to outside? These are the kinds of things that I'm itching to test out.

Those worried about their locks getting hacked can take some peace of mind from the fact the Lockitron uses the same level of encryption that banks use for online transactions. As for power, Lockitron runs on four AA batteries (included), which should last you about a year. When they're running low, Lockitron will send you alerts that it's time to replace them. If you miss this alert and the batteries die, you'll still be able to get in using your key. If your home's power or Internet connection goes down, Lockitron's Bluetooth and NFC capabilities will still work (along with the key), though the app will be temporarily rendered useless.

The jury is still out on whether any of these new locks will be able to rise above the others, but with tens of thousands of preorders already in, Lockitron looks to have a bit of a headwind as Apigy begins shipping units out. Almost every smart lock that we've seen is hovering around $200 in price and Lockitron is no different, but at $179, it is the most affordable one out there, if only by a slight margin. Whether or not it's worth the money is going to depend on how reliably it performs, so stay tuned for our full review, coming soon."
Color us impressed with Cree's TW Series LED  (hands-on)|"

Consumers looking for additional reasons to switch their lights over to LEDs will want to take a look at what Cree is offering with its new 13.5W, 60W replacement TrueWhite (TW) Series bulb, available exclusively at Home Depot for $19.97 (a 40W replacement TW Series LED is also available for $17.97).

Hailing its LEDs as ""the biggest thing since the light bulb,"" Cree already has a certified winner under its belt with the original household LED, a 9.5W 60W replacement that recently earned Energy Star qualification, knocking its already attractive $10 price tag down below $5 in certain markets that offer energy rebates. So what is it that makes the TW Series bulb worth the extra $15?



According to Cree, it's the TW Series' ""revolutionary"" CRI score of 93 out of 100. The CRI (color rendering index) determines how accurate colors appear when a given light source illuminates them. With a score of 93, the TW Series can boast that it makes colors look better than any other consumer-level LED currently available. To test this out, I illuminated a colorful bowl of fruit-flavored cereal with Cree's TW Series bulb, then compared the results with a basic LED light of equal brightness. Conducting an informal poll of my colleagues, I found that everyone I asked preferred the look of the Cree-lit cereal, citing the more vivid-looking colors.

Cree attributes the CRI jump to a new innovation called ""Spectral Notching Technology,"" which uses a combination of optical technology and the properties of a rare earth material called Neodymium to increase the clarity of the light. Whatever process they're using, it's a less efficient one than before. The TW Series puts out the same amount of light as the original Cree LED, but it needs an extra four watts to do it. That might not sound like much, but it comes out to an efficacy of 59 lumens per watt for the TW versus 84 lumens per watt for the original, so you're definitely giving up a noticeable amount of efficiency for that higher CRI.

That said, among other factors, the TW Series' CRI score was high enough to make it the first LED bulb to meet the especially strict standards of the California Energy Commission (CEC), and this means that starting in January, California consumers who upgrade to Cree's new bulbs will be able to take advantage of utility rebates. It remains to be seen whether or not the TW will qualify with Energy Star, the way its predecessor did, but for now, it's looking like a potential best buy for Californians at least.

With a low color temperature of 2,700K, the TW Series LED has a warm, yellow tone that's quite similar to what you'd expect from an incandescent bulb, so consumers looking for a familiar quality of light should be pleased with what they get. Brightness won't be a problem, either, as the TW's 800 lumens make it a worthy replacement for your standard 880 lumen, 60W incandescent.

As for life expectancy, the TW Series claims to be capable of lasting 25,000 hours before fading to 70 percent of its original brightness (that's the current definition of a ""dead"" LED). Cree is fond of pointing out that this comes out to 25 times the life expectancy of a standard incandescent, but it's also worth pointing out that 25,000 hours is only a slightly above-average life span for an LED (we've seen some bulbs go as high as 50,000 hours). Considering that Cree's original LED is rated for 25,000 hours, too, it would have been nice to see a bit of improvement here to help justify the higher price tag.

The TW Series certainly has the look and feel of a high-quality bulb, and as a product built to last me 20 years, I'd be comfortable spending $20 for it. This is especially true given the fact that it comes with a generous 10-year warranty, making it a good bulb for LED skeptics who might be wary of life expectancy claims.

Still, the original Cree LED comes with that same 10-year warranty, too, not to mention the same number of lumens, the same life expectancy, and even better efficiency. The original Cree LED costs less up front, and it'll cost you less to use down the line. In truth, the only advantage that the TW offers in comparison is that CRI score, and unless you really need your cereal to look its best, I'm not sure that it's enough of a step forward. The TW Series is an impressive bulb, no doubt, but the original Cree LED is an awfully tough act to follow."
Goji Smart Lock: The lock that knows who knocks|"

You're out of town. Someone knocks. Suddenly, you see a message on your phone: it's the picture of the person who's at your door.

The Goji Smart Lock is a bit of a hybrid; it's one part automated entry system, one part surveillance. It also lets you use a physical key, but it doesn't have to use one to open.

There are already a fair number of automated lock systems out there -- Lockitron, August Smart Lock, and Kwikset Kevo -- but the Goji's addition of a camera-notifier makes it somewhat distinct from the others.

Do you want both in your front door?



I see you A camera built into the Goji's front end has a proximity sensor that automatically takes photographs starting at a distance of 6 feet. The pictures are stored in the cloud on Goji's end, and are accessible via a smartphone app. Additionally, an embedded accelerometer triggers when your door is knocked or jostled, which causes an alert to be sent to your phone -- along with the photograph of who's there -- via e-mail or text message.

It's an idea similar to the DoorBot smart doorbell, but in a lock.

Digital keys, physical keys, phone access The Goji works three different ways: unlocking via Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) and a Goji smartphone app, unlocking via a programmable digital key fob, or unlocking via a physical key. The Smart Lock comes with four digital keys and two physical keys in the base $278 package.

The interesting part comes when you send someone a digital key that works via the app, but only at certain dates and times. You can program access for someone to only get into your home on, say, Tuesday afternoon.

Once the door unlocks, the built-in front LED screen greets you by name. Or, alternatively, it tells you that you can't enter. The front piece flips down to reveal the standard keyhole, in case you prefer more traditional entry -- or need a backup way to enter. The internal lock mechanism comes from one of the top Taiwanese lock manufacturers, according to Goji's representatives.

The Smart Lock has built-in Wi-Fi, and works with other home networks like iControl (Xfinity Home and IntelligentHome), plus Savant. You can check whether your door is locked remotely via the app, in case you feel like you forgot.

The Goji's app works on iPhones (4S or later) and the Samsung Galaxy S3 or later. That's pretty common as far as connected-device technology that uses low-energy Bluetooth goes.

How does it work?I got to see a prototype early model of the Goji, which worked with automatic unlocking via an iOS app, but I couldn't see the proximity camera in action. It wasn't exactly a real-life demonstration of the lock in action.

The Smart Lock uses four AA batteries that power it and allow automatic motorized locking. A rear home-side screen shows battery level indicators. If any connectivity or lock problems occur, Goji promises a 24-7 locksmith service to assist...but that sounds optimistic.

For real home-use review-level opinion, stay tuned for when CNET gets a unit for review. The Goji Smart Lock seems intriguing in theory, but whether all parts work perfectly and reliably will be the real test for most. The Goji Smart Lock is available for preorder now at $278, but with availability around March 2014."
Philips Friends of Hue LightStrips review:|"

Have you ever felt like your Flag Day lights were missing something? Perhaps your kickoff-timed lighting display still needs that fourth color from your team's second alternate European road trip jersey?

Rather than expanding into the galaxy of home automation component devices, Philips is taking a focused approach with its Friends of Hue product line. Hue, of course, is Philips' connected LED light bulb line that debuted last year. The Friends of Hue, at the moment comprising two accessory products, so far stay rooted in the world of LED illumination.

Among Hue's new Friends are the Bloom LED spotlight, and these $89 LightStrips, an adhesive-backed strip of tiny, programmable, LED accent lights. Intended as a companion light to go with the Philips Hue Connected Bulb Starter Pack, the LightStrips require that kit, specifically the puck-shaped networking hub that comes with it, if you want to control and customize them through your mobile device and over the Web.

Thus not only do you need to be a Hue owner to use these lights to full effect, as a niche product within a niche product category LightStrips are really aimed at Hue owners who are also particularly committed to either decorative lighting or home automation. I can recommend them if you have either or both of those enthusiasms. Few others will find this product useful.

Interactivity is by far the main selling point of Philips' LightStrips. If all you want is unobtrusive under-cabinet lighting, you can find a strip of dumb LEDs that's twice as long as the 2-meter LightStrip kit for $69 at Home Depot.

The good news is that the LightStrips' interactivity works pretty well. Philips' Hue app, available for both iOS and Android, lets you tweak the LightStrips almost as much as you can customize Philips' core Connected Bulbs. You can dim the LightStrips, change their color, and set them to go off at certain times, or in response to certain triggers (such as your proximity to home, or an IFTTT recipe.). You can also create new LightStrips-dedicated lighting schemes (aka ""Scenes"") or integrate them into existing schemes that use other Hue light sources.

One thing you can't do is set the LightStrips to the standard white-yellow-blue shades we're used to from traditional home and utility lighting. The larger Hue bulbs do an outstanding job replicating those tones, but LightStrips are limited to only 16.5 million colors on the RGB scale.

I'd also like to see Philips push harder on LightStrips' programmability. IFTTT support and an open SDK allow for creative users to make their own triggers, and even their own mobile apps, but especially in the strip layout, a built-in chase function or other sequencing effects seem like a natural fit, and a missed opportunity.



Another minor LightStrips limitation is that you'll only find three tiny LEDs per cluster. Hue bulbs have 11 LEDs working in concert. That difference in LED count is likely a big reason why LightStrips have a more limited lighting palette, and also why they don't quite have the same luminosity rating as the Hue bulbs. You'll get 600 lumens from a Hue bulb at its maximum brightness, which is enough to light a small room. LightStrips will only output 120 lumens, making them more suited to lighting up a small area.

Beyond its lighting characteristics, Philips' LightStrips are a fairly self-explanatory product. The six-foot, 3M adhesive-backed strip comes with 12-feet of power cable. That gives you decent flexibility between the power outlet and the eventual installation point, but it also means you wind up with a lot of cord to hide. If you don't need all six feet of the LightStrip itself, you can physically trim it at fixed, four-inch intervals (with three LED clusters per four inches), although anything you cut off also separates from the power supply and control circuitry, and is thus unusable.

Conclusion  Given the growing flood of generalist home automation products, Philips is smart to extend its Hue line along the specific category of home lighting. If the standard Hue bulbs or other connected LEDs haven't already drawn you to the category, I don't suspect LightStrips will sway you either, but existing converts will certainly appreciate them.

If you already count yourself among the Hue faithful, Philips Hue LightStrips will give you yet another tool in your home lighting toolbox. They're an even larger novelty than the core Hue bulbs, with all the highs and lows that entails, and at $90, those lows won't sit so well. Given the likely enthusiast-level buyers, Philips could also have sweetened the deal by adding more advanced programming behaviors. Maybe it's secure in the knowledge that for adhesive-backed strips of color-changing, programmable LED lighting, these LightStrips are at present the only product of its kind. At least they work as advertised."
Insteon LED Bulb review:|"

Light bulbs have long been seen as symbolizing good ideas, and that's exactly how Insteon hopes you'll see its LED bulb. For starters, the Insteon LED Bulb will shine as brightly as a 60W incandescent bulb while using only 8 watts' worth of energy, putting it squarely in line with other energy-saving LED bulbs. But this is Insteon we're talking about, and sure enough, this bulb is fully automatable on Insteon's network, no separate dimmer module required. Just pick a lamp or light fixture, screw in the Insteon LED Bulb, and you'll be able to control it right alongside your other Insteon gadgets by using the Insteon Hub.

A fully dimmable bulb with built-in dual-band networking capability brings some interesting flexibility to your home automation scenes. Automating an overhead ceiling light used to mean breaking out the toolbox and hard-wiring a special light switch into the wall. Now, it's as easy as replacing the light bulb. Plus, while most other, comparable LED light bulbs boast average life expectancies of 25,000 hours or so, the Insteon LED Bulb promises to last an estimated 52,000 hours. According to Insteon's claims, if you ran the light every single night for 8 hours, it wouldn't burn out for almost 18 years.



The price of a standard LED light bulb can range greatly depending on the variety and on subsidized pricing, but most comparable bulbs will cost you somewhere between $10 and $25. The Insteon LED Bulb, on the other hand, costs $29.99, and in my eyes, that's a very reasonable price, especially considering that the dimming modules and smart switches you'd otherwise be using to dim and automate the lights in your home will typically cost you at least $50. You'll need an Insteon Hub or another compatible home automation control center in order to use it, but if you're already an avid home automator, or if you're looking for reasons to get started with Insteon (aside from the lack of monthly fees), then I think you'll find the Insteon LED Bulb very appealing.

Just looking at the Insteon LED Bulb, you can tell that it isn't your average light. It sports an attractive and weighty design, with the hemispherical bulb housed in a durable white plastic casing. At a weight of 6.2 ounces, it's noticeably heavier than a standard light bulb -- the cheap flex lamp I used for a few of my tests could barely support it.

With its 8W of energy usage, the Insteon LED Bulb claims to produce as much light as a 60W incandescent bulb (the Insteon site actually lists it as 60W to 100W). This might be pushing it just a little, as the bulb definitely looks to be at least slightly on the dimmer side of expectations. We weren't surprised to find that it puts out 591 lumens of light, which isn't terrible, but still falls short of other leading LED bulbs, which can put out as much as 900 lumens or so. With its warm tone, the Insteon is fine for an accent light, or if used in combination with other light sources, but don't expect to light up an entire room to satisfaction with just one.

The Insteon LED Bulb has a color-rendering index (CRI) of 82, which is on par with an above-average household bulb. The CRI score is actually an average of several scores, each rating the light source's ability to faithfully reproduce colors in comparison with natural daylight. The higher a light's score, the more accurate it will make colors appear. Bulbs that score in the 90s are typically only used by photographers and other professionals with a need for vivid, highly accurate, natural-looking light; bulbs in the 80s tend to be higher-end bulbs for everyday home use.

As a rating system, the CRI is far from perfect, but still, 82 is an acceptable score. However, with standard LED bulbs like Cree's TrueWhite 60W Replacement and the Philips EnduraLED scoring in the low 90s (the same can be said of the Philips Hue), I'd feel a little better about Insteon's offering if it had scored somewhere above 85.

To control the Insteon LED Bulb, you'll need an automation control center like the Insteon Hub, which will connect your bulb to your home network. You'll be able to turn the light on or off remotely, either from a computer or from Insteon's free smartphone app, available both for iOS and Android devices. You'll also still be able to turn the light on and off manually like any other light, although automations and remote capabilities go out the window once you switch off the power.



You really can't ask for much more from this bulb in terms of usability. Just screw it in, turn it on, pull up the Insteon app, and you'll be automating your light within seconds. There are no extra buttons to press or codes to enter. As smart as it is, it's still just a light bulb. I appreciate simplicity in a smart device, but it's worth mentioning that if you're looking for the kind of unique functionality offered by something like the Philips Hue and its on-demand, programmable color changes, you might want to look elsewhere.

Once you've added your bulb to your home automation network, turning it on and off remotely and adjusting the dimmer are as simple as tapping a button or moving a slider. That said, the Insteon app is far from our favorite piece of home automation software, as it gave us more-than-occasional lag issues and inconsistent alert performance. As far as the Insteon Hub goes, I was more impressed with the range and performance of the Nexia Bridge, as well as the high quality of its app and website. However, unlike Nexia, Insteon doesn't charge a monthly fee to use its automation services. This seems to be a trump card for most consumers, meaning that Insteon's services don't need to be perfect, or even better than a system like Nexia's. Rather, it just needs to be ""good enough,"" and for now, the service Insteon offers certainly is.

With 52,000 hours before it burns out, it'll be a good long while before you need to replace your bulb. Until that day comes, maintenance will be something of a nonissue. The Insteon LED Bulb uses internal EEPROM read-only memory to retain its schedules and automation settings even when the power is cut, so unless you manually remove it from your network of devices, you won't have to worry about constantly reintroducing it to the Insteon Hub.

The Insteon LED Bulb is intended only for indoor use, with an operating temperature range of 32 to 104 degrees Farenheit (0 to 40 Celsius) and operating within a relative humidity range of 0 to 90 percent.

Insteon offers a 2-year limited warranty with the LED Bulb. Free technical guidance is available over e-mail at Insteon's support page, along with toll-free phone support or live online chat support six days a week.

For existing Insteon users, the appeal of the Insteon LED Bulb is clear. You'll spend less money than you would on a smart switch or a dimming module, and you'll be giving your system another level of flexibility. The fact that the bulb itself is limited to one tone, one shape, and one size is perhaps a bit disappointing, as multiple options would have expanded the product's flexibility even further, but this is pretty minor, as quibbles go.

If you automate your home, or if you're interested in getting started with home automation, controlling your lights is probably one of your chief concerns. With the Insteon LED Bulb, you'll have an automatable lighting option that's flexible, affordable, and simple to use. Best of all, the thing is built to last -- and built to save you money while it's busy lasting. For $29.99, you could sure do worse."
Insteon Starter Kit review:|"

At the time of this review's publication, the reviewer was unaware of the conditional automation possible by linking a motion detector to a ""scene"" of linked devices. The Insteon Hub's app is capable of automating lights to turn on or off when motion is detected, as our readers have pointed out, and the review has been adjusted accordingly. This feature is only available through the purchase of the motion detector hardware, which is not included in the Insteon Starter Kit base package.

If you're looking for a start in home automation that's free from fuss -- and, more importantly, free from monthly fees -- then you might want to consider the Insteon Starter Kit, available for $119 exclusively at Best Buy. Insteon claims that with its line of automation products and its free smartphone app, ""your home is with you wherever you go.""

You should temper your expectations here, as the Starter Kit, with its two LampLinc dimmers and the router-esque Insteon Hub, will only allow you to automate a pair of lamps. Automating just two lamps is a tad underwhelming. The important thing is that with the Insteon Hub, you'll have a sturdy home automation foundation to build upon. Add the Insteon Thermostat to your system, for instance, and you'll be able to control the temperature of your home remotely. Add an Insteon Motion Sensor or perhaps an Open/Close Sensor for your front door, and you'll be able to receive alerts whenever someone's moving through your home. With the Insteon Leak Sensor, you'll be able to detect minor drips before they become major catastrophes. While all of these devices are all sold separately from the Starter Kit, Insteon won't ever charge you a monthly fee to automate them, no matter how many of them you add to your network.

The real downside is that unlike newer automation systems such as WeMo, Nexia Home Intelligence, and SmartThings, Insteon's Starter Kit doesn't offer you conditional, IFTTT-style automation between multiple devices, at least not without paying for additional devices and upgrades to your system. Even then, the process of getting these devices working in tandem is far more cumbersome than it ought to be, and certainly more of a headache than what we've seen with other systems. For instance, even once you buy a separate Insteon-compatible motion detector, the app won't let you simply connect it directly to another device to power it on and off with motion. To do that, you'll need to connect the motion detector with a ""Scene"" of linked devices that automate simultaneously. It's a far clunkier process than what we've seen in the WeMo app, or the highly intuitive and powerful Nexia website.

All in all, it's a pretty heavy limitation given the current trend toward conditional automation, and it's a shortcoming that we hope Insteon addresses as it continues updating its products and app. Still, if you have a a specific interest in controlling and monitoring your smart devices remotely, you'll want to give Insteon a look, especially if you're looking to avoid paying monthly fees and don't have a specific need for more powerful programming right out of the box. If you decide Insteon would work for you, then the Best Buy-exclusive Starter Kit, which costs $10 less than the Insteon Hub does on its own, is the way you'll want to go.

Design and featuresAt first glance, you might mistake the Insteon Hub for a Wii accessory. It's a stark, minimalist device, with just one blue LED light, two ports (Ethernet and power), and no buttons, save for the tiny reset button hidden in the back. To get your system up and running, you'll plug the Hub into a wall outlet (Insteon asks you to avoid power strips, if possible), then plug it into your router using the included Ethernet cable. From there, the free Insteon Hub app, available for both iOS and Android, will take care of the rest, making quick, easy work of the setup process. This includes adding the LampLinc dimmers to your system -- just tell the app you're adding a device, then hold the ""set"" button down on each dimmer you want to add.

The LampLinc dimmers look fine, and match the Hub with their stark, blocky white finish and LED light. They won't block an entire wall outlet, so long as you use the bottom socket. However, you'll have to plug your lamp up into the bottom of each dimmer, so if your outlets sit low to the ground, plugging your lamp in might be awkward. Placing the socket on the front of the device, as the WeMo Switch does, would have been a better design call.

As for the app, it's pretty bare-bones for the home automation scene, but it does the job. You can assign one of a few dozen icons to each of your devices (for my flex lamp, I went with a light bulb). Tapping that icon will then allow you to control that device. In the case of the light dimmers, you'll be able to turn a lamp on or off, or by pressing a small plus sign icon, you'll have access to a dimming slider, along with up and down arrows that will let you ""bump"" the light level up or down. If you tap the gear icon, then ""Edit settings,"" then select the device you want to tinker with, you'll be able to rename it, change the icon, set up a schedule for when you want it to activate and deactivate, and also set alerts that will notify you whenever the device turns on or off. None of it is too difficult or complicated, but as apps go, it's probably a bit clunkier than it needs to be, and definitely somewhat lacking in polish.

The limitations of the Insteon system become evident the more you use the app. Some are fairly trivial, such as the fact that you can't create custom icons for your devices by snapping pictures of them, the way you can with most other home automation apps. Others are more disappointing, like the fact that the app will only let you set one schedule for each lamp -- one time for it to turn on, and one time for it to turn off.

You can't add additional timing rules from the LampLinc's in-app device settings, although there is a workaround that again involves the app's customizable scenes. A morning scene might have all of your lights turn on together at 7 a.m., for instance. If you wanted to create an additional schedule for a lamp, you could simply create a scene with that lamp as its only device. Still, this is barely acceptable. Setting multiple on and off times for a device is about as standard as home automation gets these days. The fact that Insteon forces you to employ a workaround to accomplish such basic functionality doesn't inspire much confidence in the thoughtfulness of the system.

Usability and performance  Limitations aside, the Insteon app is a largely reliable piece of software. When you log in and tell the app to turn your lamp on, you can feel confident that it's going to turn your lamp on. Interestingly enough, the app differentiates between local usage and remote usage. Getting the app to work on your local network is a piece of cake, but Insteon openly acknowledges that the router wrangling and port forwarding required before you'll be able to monitor and control your devices from beyond your home network might be a bit tricky, especially for networking novices.

This is actually where Insteon shines a little bit, bracing users for a potential challenge by offering them step-by-step instructions specific to their particular brand of router, all directly within the app. Users still experiencing difficulty are also encouraged to call Insteon toll free for live assistance. It's a refreshingly honest and straightforward approach to an often finicky area of home automation, where full setup is rarely as simple as the product's instructions would have you believe.

In terms of performance testing, the Insteon Starter Kit's limited functionality didn't leave a lot of room for experimentation. Scheduling lights to automatically come on and off worked just fine in every one of our tests, and manual controls were equally reliable. I was not, however, able to get the Insteon app to alert me when the light was turned on or off, despite explicitly telling it to do so. This included instances where the light was turned on and off automatically as well as instances where I turned it on and off manually, through the app's local network controls. Curious about this, I added an Insteon Motion Sensor to the network and set the app to alert me whenever it detected motion. The SMS alerts came through just as promised each and every time. Still, when it came to lights, nothing I tried got the alerts to come through in any form. This was a definite disappointment, and a bit of a head-scratcher, as well.

Maintenance By design, home automation systems typically don't require a great deal of maintenance, if any, and the Insteon is no different. Once you've got your system up and running, you can largely forget about it. Neither the Hub nor the LampLinc dimmers run on batteries, although some of the additional, separately sold sensors, like the motion detector, do. If you add any of these to your system, you'll need to change the batteries periodically. Unlike some other home automation apps, the Insteon's app will not track the remaining battery life of your devices, or alert you if their batteries are running low.

Service and support  Should you encounter any difficulties with your system, Insteon offers toll-free technical support over the phone six days a week, and also one-on-one live chat support through its Web site. The site also features an online version of the same port forwarding guide included within the app, as well as full documentation for every Insteon-compatible sensor and accessory currently available for sale.

Conclusion  In years past, the Insteon system's limitations and inconsistencies wouldn't have been as noticeable or as damning. However, the home automation game has changed, with new options available that are more powerful, more flexible, and more affordable than ever before. The bar has been raised, and Insteon hasn't necessarily risen to meet the challenge. Still, experienced home automators with aging systems might appreciate that the Insteon claims to be compatible with existing X10 devices, and for these existing networks, the Insteon Hub might make a good fit. People looking for something specific from their system, like leak or smoke detection, might also be satisfied with the Insteon's wide array of specific automatable sensors.

However, for people new to home automation, Insteon's Starter Kit isn't anything close to the starter kit I'd recommend. For $119, you're getting a system capable of lamp automation and lamp automation alone, and unless you purchase a separate motion detector or other upgrades, those automations will be about as basic as it gets. Compare that with the Belkin WeMo Switch + Motion, which costs $40 less ($70 less if you don't want the motion detector), can automate anything with a plug on it (not just lamps), and is fully compatible with IFTTT and the highly advanced conditional automation that comes with it - all right out of the box, no additional components or upgrades necessary. Which one sounds like the smarter start to you?"
Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat review:|"

Editor's Note: The power cord used for this installation is not included in the standard packaging.

Thermostat giant Honeywell designed this Wi-Fi-enabled model in direct response to the innovative Nest Learning Thermostat created by Apple alumni Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers. Honeywell went so far as to file a lawsuit against Nest on February 6, 2012, claiming the new company violated seven existing Honeywell patents in the making of their iPod-inspired thermostat. Strip away all of that drama, and you still end up with two extremely capable products that have top-notch functionality and identical $249 price tags. So, what makes Honeywell's Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat unique?

In brief, the Honeywell has more predictable design characteristics, a much busier home display, and, in my case, a more complex set-up process. There are a few other slight deviations between models, but the design and installation will be the main deal makers -- or deal breakers -- for most. Where the Nest packaging is akin to that of an Apple product, (it includes a screwdriver and the Web site even offers a quiz that you can take before buying to find out if your home is compatible) the Honeywell is comparatively no-frills. I would recommend the Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat to any home automation DIYer who appreciates traditional style and doesn't need hand-holding during the installation. Just know that it might not work in every home.

Design This Honeywell is a slightly sleekified version of that old boxy thermostat you probably have at home now. On the home screen, you will see the date and time, the indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity, and up and down arrows so you can change the temperature manually. It's considerably smaller than my old thermostat and it doesn't come with different size base plates, so the previous paint job is clearly visible on all sides.



The Nest, on the other hand, is round and comes with a square and a larger rectangular base plate to cover up any unsightly holes or paint. Its home display is also extremely minimal; it shows the current temperature and that's about it. Honeywell places more emphasis on utility by displaying more information up front, whereas the Nest is more streamlined and design-focused. It's really a matter of preference here.

This DIY installation is not for beginners. There are many different types of heating and cooling systems and some of them just won't be compatible with this thermostat. Honeywell doesn't do a great job of warning you about that beforehand, which leads into a larger issue I had with this setup. You really need a C or ""common"" wire to power this model. There are a couple of different workarounds available if you don't have a C wire, but they aren't guaranteed to work on every system. So that could cause some installations to come to a screeching halt.

For example, my system has a G, a W, a Y, and an Rh wire. To get power to my thermostat without a C wire, I had two main options. I could run a new wire from the HVAC to the thermostat and assign it to both C ports or I could redirect the G wire to the C wire port at the thermostat and HVAC terminal (which would disable my ability to adjust the fan at will). It was around this time that I learned that my HVAC unit is not in great shape. Everything is connected with wire nuts and there's no terminal unit to be found. I am not nearly experienced enough to figure out where to put the C wire without a port labeled ""C"" in my HVAC. The same goes for rerouting the G wire to the C wire port -- my system doesn't have a traditional G or C port.

Fortunately, Honeywell also provides power cords to reviewers as a simple and quick installation option. Unfortunately, the cord isn't included when you buy this thermostat or available as a separate commercial purchase. Basically, I wouldn't have been able to install the Honeywell thermostat at all without either the power cord (which isn't an actual option) or help from an electrician. I can't exactly blame Honeywell for my sketchy HVAC unit, but the Nest doesn't require a C wire in most houses. Points Nest.

Usability Like the Nest, the Honeywell thermostat functions so much like a regular digital thermostat that you shouldn't experience too much of a learning curve when you want to use it on your wall.

The Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat is also remotely accessible via free Web-based and Android and iOS mobile apps. I've been using the Honeywell Total Connect Comfort iOS app and it's very intuitive, although the frequent log-outs are annoying.

On the app home page, you'll see a list of all of your connected Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostats. You can customize the names of each, say ""First Floor Thermostat"" and ""Second Floor Thermostat,"" or ""Bedroom"" and ""Living Room"" to distinguish among them. Then you can select the thermostat you want to adjust and you get a quick snapshot of its status. I'm at work, but the app tells me that my house is currently at 75 degrees with 54-percent humidity. If I want a more detailed picture, I can click again and it will display more information. Now I can see that it's 86 degrees outside with 60 percent humidity and it lets me know that it's following the schedule I programmed when I first installed the thermostat. I also have the option to adjust the temperature or completely modify my heating/cooling schedule from the office. The Honeywell Total Connect Comfort Web app works in exactly the same way.



Features Even if you don't set a schedule for your thermostat, the Honeywell will use algorithms to ""learn"" your habits and will begin to automatically adjust your heating and cooling based on your usage patterns. Of course, you can still override this by manually adjusting the temperature.

It also offers advanced fan settings designed to keep you comfortable and save energy simultaneously. You can adjust the background color from an established list or use the custom menu to create your own color scheme. This thermostat will send you warnings when it registers an extreme degree shift beyond the norm and lets you know when it's time to replace your air filter. It also tracks the indoor humidity and displays the external temperature and humidity.

If you're worried about security, you have the option of locking the touch screen and you can adjust the length of time the backlight stays illuminated. Honeywell says this thermostat can maintain one degree of accuracy on any temperature setting. That's great, but your heat or air conditioning will kick on more frequently as a result, so you can adjust it down whenever you want.

These Honeywell features closely mirror what Nest offers. Similarly, the Nest will help you save money by studying your energy usage and adjusting accordingly. It relies on system runtime to send filter change reminders. So, the more you use your heating or cooling, the more often you will receive filter replacement notifications. It has built-in sensors that track indoor humidity readings and it notes weather conditions via Wi-Fi to determine how the outside temperature influences your indoor heating and cooling patterns. It also allows you to set an acceptable temperature range and use a four-digit code to keep anyone from making unauthorized changes. Unlike the Honeywell, you cannot change the background color of the Nest. However, the stainless steel ring it comes with claims to adopt the color of the wall like a chameleon. A more significant difference is that the Nest can only promise to get within three degrees of accuracy, so the concept of ""set temperature"" is a bit more liberal.

Performance The Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat exceeded my expectations. The temperature adjusted automatically based on my typical heating and cooling cycle and the scheduling functionality also performed without any hiccups. The touch screen and app are both highly responsive and if your Wi-Fi goes out, your thermostat will continue to function like a regular digital model.

Chances are that this thermostat is more intuitive and efficient than the one you have now and, as a result, it will save you money over time. The only performance problem I noted was that the outdoor temperature and humidity reading is sporadic at best. But for most, that's probably not going to be the deciding factor against purchasing this thermostat.

Conclusion Honeywell staked its claim in the DIY smart thermostat market with this $249 Wi-Fi-enabled model. Its feature-rich display, straightforward Web and mobile apps, and top-notch functionality make it a worthy rival for the identically priced Nest Learning Thermostat. If you're comfortable with electrical wiring, the buying decision may come down to aesthetics, since they have nearly identical functionality with different design structures.

For me, the main decision comes down to the ease of installation. Overall, each one is a useful addition to your home and especially appealing if you're into DIY and looking for new ways to automate. I'm also interested to see how this market develops. Even if its design isn't quite as polished, Honeywell has shown it can match the Nest in terms of basic functionality. The competition between these two is sure to intensify."
Schlage Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt review:|"

When most homeowners think about upgrading their home appliances, they tend to think first about splurging on a high-end washer/dryer combo, or maybe a flashy new fridge. But there are plenty of subtle ways to upgrade your home that can make your everyday life easier, including smartening up your deadbolt.

Enter the Schlage Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt. With the Camelot's touchscreen, you can leave the key in your pocket and gain entry by punching in a code. After heading inside, the door will automatically lock behind you in case you forget. If someone tries to break in or tamper with the lock, a built-in alarm will sound, alerting you to the issue and hopefully scaring the would-be intruder off. And, if you're willing to pay $59.99 for the Nexia Bridge control unit, along with $9.99 a month for Nexia Home Intelligence's home automation system, you can hook your deadbolt up to your computer, smartphone, or tablet to control it remotely, or even connect it with your lights to have them come on as automatically when you come in after a long day at work.

The idea of paying a monthly fee for your deadbolt might leave a bad taste in your mouth, and rightly so. If the Camelot is the only thing you'd be automating, then buying a Nexia Bridge and paying the subscription fee almost certainly isn't worth it. But Nexia is designed to control all sorts of devices - locks, lights, thermostats, motion detectors, you name it. If you'd be interested in building a home automation system, with lots of devices working together to make your life easier, then upgrading to Nexia might make sense, and that $9.99 a month might be a bit more palatable.

The Camelot retails for $199, although you can get it at some retailers like Home Depot for closer to $160. That's still a lot more than you'll pay for a basic deadbolt at a corner hardware store, but given the Camelot's quality and functionality, I think that it's actually a pretty fair price. It's worth noting, though, that several new smart locks are due for release by the end of the year, including some intriguing crowd-sourced models from independent developers. All of these options will cost more than $160, so homeowners looking for a security upgrade should still take a look at what the Camelot can offer, especially ones who might, at some point down the line, be interested in automating the rest of their castles, too.

Design and features The Camelot is a great-looking lock, and with four different finishes to choose from, it will match almost any front door decor. In addition, Schlage offers the Century Touchscreen Deadbolt, which offers the exact same features and functions of the Camelot at the same price, but with a more modern design.

The outer face of the lock features the touchscreen, where you'll punch in your code to get inside. Tapping the Schlage button will illuminate the numbers with soft blue light, making it easy to use at night. The lock will beep with every tap of the numbers, although you can turn these sounds off if you wish. There's also a convenient green checkmark icon that will flash with each button press, reassuring you that it registered your input. For security, the touchscreen is contoured with a bumpy matte finish - this makes it fingerprint-proof and prevents clever burglars from figuring out your code, but it also makes the screen slightly less responsive than we'd like.

On the inner side of the door, the lock is tall and just a tad bulky, but understandably so - it has to house the battery pack and the unit's motherboard, as well as the lock-turning mechanism. There's a traditional knob, meaning that the lock will be usable even if the battery runs dead, and also another Schlage button that's used for programming and deactivating the alarm.

You can set the motion-sensing alarm to one of three settings. You can set it to only go off when it detects that someone is trying to break the door down, or you can set it to go off if it detects that the inside of the lock is being tampered with, thwarting lockpick-savvy hooligans (we found that in this mode, the alarm will go off even if you just insert the key and wiggle it around a little bit). There's also an ""Activity"" mode, where the lock will beep twice whenever the door is opened or closed. You can adjust the sensitivity of the sensors for all three modes, or you can turn all of them off altogether.

You can adjust all other settings through the lock's touchpad. Your lock will come with two four-digit starter codes, as well as a six-digit programming code. Entering this programming code into the lock will trigger a mode where you can add or delete access codes and tweak other various settings. For instance, you can set the lock to ""Vacation Mode,"" which disables all codes and relies exclusively on the key to allow entry - just make sure you remember to bring it with you to Belize.

A deadbolt with a brain Users looking for even more functionality from their Camelot deadbolt can also purchase a Nexia Bridge from Nexia Home Intelligence, Schlage's partner in home automation. For $59.99, the Nexia Bridge will plug into your router and act as the brain for all of your automatable devices, connecting them through the Z-Wave wireless network. In the Camelot's case, you'll be able to lock and unlock the door remotely from the Nexia Web site or using the Nexia app. You'll also be able to create relationships between the Camelot and the other devices in your system, say, your lights. For instance, you could set your lights to turn on automatically whenever you enter your code into the lock, or maybe tell your thermostat to start running the air. All of these Nexia-compatible devices are sold separately, though, so be prepared to shell out some cash in order to build your network, and keep in mind that you'll also need to pay Nexia $9.99 a month.

Using Nexia's Web site will also give you access to some new functionality for the lock. Instead of using the touch screen and entering the programming code, you'll be able to quickly adjust whatever setting you want just by hopping online. You can also create temporary codes with built-in expiration dates, or codes that will only work on certain days or at certain times of day -- an excellent way of letting house cleaners or pet sitters in, or keeping the in-laws at bay.

The Nexia Web site will also generate a timeline showing you every time the deadbolt has been locked and unlocked over the past 90 days. If someone inputs a code, the site will track which one, so if you give unique codes to each person who uses the lock (the Camelot can store up to 30 of them), then you'll be able to tell who is coming and going, and when.

Installation and usability Installing the Camelot is a simple enough process -- the only tool that you'll need is a screwdriver, and it shouldn't take you longer than 15 or 20 minutes. The installation instructions are simple and straightforward, with clear, step-by-step directions and diagrams aplenty. If you've ever successfully put together furniture from Ikea, you should be fine.

The lock itself is adjustable to fit doors of varying widths and thicknesses, and should work in most homes. The Schlage Web site offers an online guide to help prospective buyers make sure that their door will be able to house the Camelot.

In our usability tests, the Camelot scored quite well. For basic functions, the initial codes provided with the lock will do just fine, letting you in and out with ease. If you need to change the settings, you'll need to follow the programming guide in the instruction manual. Fortunately, I found the guide clear, concise, and very helpful. And, should you also decide to try out the Nexia Bridge, the system's usability rockets off the chart due to the added access management functions. The company's Web site is also one of the best designed home automation control centers that I've seen.

Maintenance The Camelot runs on four AA batteries (not included). When these run low, the lock will alert you that it's time for a change. For an added layer of security, Schlage also recommends that you periodically change your codes.

Schlage offers a lifetime warranty on the finish and mechanics of the deadbolt, and guarantees the electrical components for one year. The company's Web site features full documentation for the Camelot, along with troubleshooting tips, frequently asked questions, and installation guides. Customer service is also available over the phone six days a week.

Conclusion The Schlage Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt is a marketed as a majestic and powerful device, and we have to say that it delivers on this promise. At $160 or more, depending on the specific finish you select and whether you decide to tack on the Nexia Bridge, it certainly isn't cheap, but the high quality merits a higher price. Considering how often we all use our front-door locks, upgrading to a more functional model makes sense, and if you're going to upgrade, the Schlage Camelot Touchscreen Deadbolt deserves to be toward the top of your list.

However, prospective buyers should also keep an eye out for new, soon-to-be-released smart locks, such as the Lockitron, the Kevo, the Goji, and the August. All of these will offer comparable functionality to the Camelot, and none of them come will with any monthly subscription fees. Still, they'll all cost more than $160, and if you don't splurge on Nexia's home automation services, that's all you'll pay for the Camelot. You might want to wait until all of your options are available before making a purchase, but if the Camelot looks good to you now, I say go for it.

I don't, however, recommend getting the Nexia Bridge if you only intend to use it to automate your lock. As much as I like the additional features and the power of the Nexia Web site, the added price and the monthly subscription fee just aren't worth it for one device alone. Those interested in getting started with home automation, however, might find Nexia's system to be totally worthwhile -- they can find my review of the Nexia Bridge here."
iSmartAlarm review:|"

You can't put a price on peace of mind, but that doesn't mean you have to overpay for home security. Now, with Indiegogo darling iSmartAlarm on the market, you don't. Its complete home security packages start at $199 with no contracts or monthly fees. Just set up the motion sensors, cameras, and alarms as you see fit, then monitor everything using the company's free app. It's smarter, more affordable home security for a new generation of DIY-ers.

Skeptics might be quick to point out that unlike the more established heavy hitters of home security, iSmartAlarm doesn't currently offer live monitoring. If somethings triggers your alarm, it won't alert an operator. Instead, you'll get a text message alerting you to the breach, as well as an automated phone call. From there, calling the police is left up to you.



For me, these concerns were less important than the fact that the highly touted iCamera was too temperamental. Still, it's hard not to like what iSmartAlarm is doing. It isn't the system I'd use to protect a Picasso, but for lower-stakes scenarios, it's truly a game changer. Consumers who have long felt priced out of home security finally have a legitimate and affordable alternative, and the appeal doesn't stop there -- even if money is no concern, you might still prefer iSmartAlarm's control and customizability.

Simply put, if you're thinking about securing your home, there really isn't a good reason not to give iSmartAlarm serious consideration. And if you've already gone with a more expensive option, you might want to look into switching to iSmartAlarm and saying goodbye to those monthly fees.

Flexible features, customizable control iSmartAlarm's variety of sensors promises comprehensive coverage of your home security needs. Its Preferred Package, which runs for $199, includes a motion detector, two contact sensors for detecting when doors or windows are opened and closed, two remote tags that clip onto your keychain and allow you to arm and disarm the system, and the system's brain, the CubeOne, which also features a built in panic siren. For $150 more, the Premium Package adds the iCamera to your setup. Whichever package you choose, you'll be able to add additional sensors, sirens, cameras, and remotes a la carte style, so customizing the system to fit the specific size and needs of your home won't be a problem.

No matter how many devices you end up purchasing, you'll control all of them through the iSmartAlarm app, a free download for iOS users that's coming soon to Android devices, too. The app's four-button home screen mirrors the remote tag, allowing you to arm the system, disarm the system, activate the panic siren, or go into ""Home Mode,"" which disables the motion detectors but leaves the contact sensors active - perfect for protecting your house without having to worry about the pets triggering a false alarm.

If you spring for the iCamera, be prepared for potential frustration with the setup process. The folks at iSmartAlarm acknowledged that it tends to not play nice with about 10 to 15 percent of routers on the market today, although they maintain that they're able to help all users ultimately get it up and running smoothly. My experience wasn't quite that simple, which I'll get to.

When the camera does work, the app will display the iCamera's field of view for you, and also let you move it around just by swiping your fingers. You can also pre-set the iCamera's default viewing angle -- if the alarm is ever triggered, the camera will maneuver back to this framing and automatically save what it sees to the cloud, hopefully capturing the intruder on film. The camera won't detect or follow movement, though, which would have been a very nice added feature.

You can rename each sensor within the app to help keep things straight (""Front Door,"" ""Back Door,"" and so on). You can also set names for the owner of each remote tag, which will help you track who's coming and going. For both the sensors and the remotes, you can upload photos, which doesn't really add any functionality, but still helps to personalize the app and make it more visually appealing. If someone else downloads the app and wants to link up with your security network, they'll just have to scan a QR code on your phone.

When something triggers the alarm, the panic siren sounds automatically, and you'll receive a text alert notifying you exactly what part of the system went off. This is where renaming each sensor really comes in handy -- getting a 3:30 a.m. message that says ""Contact Sensor No. 3 has been opened"" is a lot less helpful than one that says ""The back door has been opened.""

In addition to the text alert, you'll receive an automated robocall from iSmartAlarm telling you that the alarm has been triggered and warning you not to return home until you are sure that it's safe. Like with the texts, you can set multiple numbers to receive this call.

Usability For the most part, I found the iSmartAlarm's user experience to be one of the best of any of the home automation systems I've tested so far. The system's base of operations, the CubeOne, is beyond easy to install -- just plug it in, connect it to your router, then let the app walk you through the rest. From there, the contact sensors, motion detectors, and remote tags all connect to the system in mere seconds. From the time I opened the box, it was less than a few minutes before I had the core components of the system up and running.

The exception to this ease of use is the iCamera. I followed the instructions for linking it up with the system to the letter, and still had major problems getting the video to display properly, or at all (most of the time, the best I could get was a white, locked-up screen and an endlessly spinning wheel of frustration). Troubleshooting the problem pointed to a port issue with our building's router, so I tried to start fresh and set the system up on a completely separate home network. Still, the issue persisted, making me 0 for 2. Ultimately, after some fiddling, I got the camera working, but performance was spotty, and before long, the video once again dropped out completely.

I've seen the iCamera in action before, and it's an impressive part of iSmartAlarm's system when it's working as promised. But given how finicky it was during testing, I can't recommend splurging on one when you're choosing your iSmartAlarm setup. For now, I say stick with the $199 iCamera-less Preferred Package -- you can always add a camera later if you decide you need one.

iDesign The glossy, white finish of the CubeOne, with its white, softly ""breathing"" LED is an obvious callback to earlier generations of iPods and MacBooks, and the rest of the system's design feels equally lifted from the Apple portfolio. I'm not saying this is a bad thing -- it suggests a certain accessibility that comes with Apple's old all-white aesthetic, and given that iSmartAlarm is making home security more accessible, that's probably an accurate fit. Still, you can't help but wish they had borrowed just a little bit less from Apple's mid-2000s playbook, not to mention from the playbooks of the countless other companies that have mimicked Apple's approach to branding.

Lifted looks aside, the iSmartAlarm is designed quite well from a standpoint of functionality. The CubeOne, which needs to stay connected to your router, should fit in nicely on whatever shelf you've designated for your network accessories. Its likely proximity to your television and other high-end electronics commonly targeted by thieves make it a logical choice for housing the system's main panic alarm. If you keep your router someplace other than the living room or bedroom, you might consider purchasing an extra siren to ensure the panic alarm sits in earshot of your home's more highly trafficked areas.



The contact sensors apply easily to doors and windows with the included peel-off sticky tags, and are designed to give you plenty of freedom about where they go. Place them high or place them low, as long as each one straddles the gap between the door and the frame, they'll work as promised. This flexibility also means that you can get creative about how you use them. If you're leaving the kids at home for the weekend, you can quickly relocate a sensor onto the liquor cabinet, for instance. You'd have to call a technician to come and rewire your system if you wanted to do that with a subscription-based security service.

Performance Aside from the disappointing iCamera performance, the iSmartAlarm system left me thoroughly impressed. After the painless setup process, everything just worked the way it was supposed to. The motion detector and contact sensors were easy to get situated, and they performed exactly as promised, never failing to catch a trigger.

The remote tags were another huge plus, as there's just something reassuring about having a physical button to press, as opposed to being forced to fiddle with an app every time you wish to arm or disarm the system. In fact, after setting the system up, you wouldn't ever have to use the app if you didn't want to -- just press the arm button on the remote when you leave the house, then the home button as you're coming back in. If someone tries to break in, you'll get a phone call. That level of simplicity is undeniably appealing when we're talking about home automation - the whole point is to make life less complicated, not more so.

The important take-away is that this is a system you can feel comfortable relying upon. For smaller homes in particular, the protection it offers rivals what the established brands can offer and perhaps even surpasses it. Unless you have an especially large home with multiple rooms and openings to protect, the iSmartAlarm will likely be a strong enough performer to grant you the peace of mind you're looking for. I wouldn't set it up at Fort Knox, but for my 800-square-foot apartment, it'd do just fine.

Maintenance Once you've got it up and running, the iSmartAlarm suite is about as hands-off and maintenance-free as it gets. Just set it up, get into the habit of arming and disarming it according to your schedule, then rest assured that it will be there when you need it. As the smartphone app continues to improve, expect fairly regular updates -- these should download in a matter of seconds, and may well bring new functionality to the system in months to come.

If you decide to upgrade your setup with additional sensors, adding them to the system is a quick process - just turn them on and tell the app to scan for them. Moving the sensors someplace new isn't a problem either; just make sure to disarm the system first. If you use the included sticky pads to attach the contact sensors to your doors or windows, it might take a few minutes of elbow grease to scrub the residue off after removing them.

With the exception of the CubeOne and the iCamera, all of the iSmartAlarm's sirens and sensors are battery operated. The motion detector uses three AA batteries, which come included, while the contact sensors and remote tags each use a single CR2032 button battery, also included. The app includes a separate battery reading for each device, and will let you know when they need to be replaced.

Service and support iSmartAlarm offers a one-year limited warranty on each system sold. In addition, systems purchased directly through www.ismartalarm.com can be returned unused and in their original packaging for a full refund for up to 30 days following the shipping date.

Technical support is available via e-mail, and also through the system's Web site. iSmartAlarm uses a ""support ticket"" system, meaning that all support requests can be tracked by the user as they're processed by iSmartAlarm.

Conclusion

Many people see home security systems as an unaffordable luxury, and in many cases rightfully so. After factoring in the contractual period of subscription fees, the cost of even the most basic security package can soar well over $1,500 over a period of just a few years. Installing a home security system definitely wasn't affordable for me back when I was in college, even though I lived in a high-crime area and could have used the protection. Sure enough, our place got robbed one night when a thief broke in through our bathroom window. Amid the anger, fear, and sense of violation, I remember feeling frustrated that our only choices seemed to be spending more than we could afford on additional home security, moving, or continuing on, largely unprotected. My friends and I chose the latter option, though we never really felt safe in that house again after that.

I've been thinking about that robbery quite a bit as I've been testing this system. What I needed back then was a better option, and I'm convinced that iSmartAlarm is that better option. In the case of that bathroom-window break-in, I think that there's a very good chance that the iSmartAlarm's panic siren would have scared the thief off, just as an expensive subscription service probably would have. The key difference is that at $199, the iSmartAlarm is a system that would have been accessible to me back then, and that, more than the technology itself, is what's truly game-changing here. People who've never been able to even consider upgrading their home security finally have access to a legitimate alternative. To me, that's tech at its best."
Philips Hue Connected Bulb starter pack review:|"

Like many of the new breed of user-installable, smartphone-controlled home tech products, the WiFi-connected Philips Hue lighting kit has high geek/novelty appeal. After all, it's a color-changing, LED light bulb package you can program from a smartphone. But beyond its remote on/off and scheduling functions you'll need to get really into the extended features--like geofencing and IFTTT support--to make this kit worth $199 (AU$249 for those in Australia).

Those features won't appeal universally, but they will have their niche fans. What house party DJ or dorm room Lothario wouldn't love an automated, multihued mood-setter? For the hyper-connected, setting the lights to blink with every retweet could also be a draw. By smartly allowing the public to make its own apps for the Hue, Philips has also left the doors of possibility wide open.

Even if you don't appreciate the Hue's advanced features now, someone might one day write an app for it that perfectly fills some unrealized need. I wouldn't recommend the Philips Hue Connected Bulb kit if all you want is basic remote lighting controls, but it's a reliable, mostly easy-to-use choice if you want to inject some intelligence into your home lighting scheme.

The Philips Hue Connected Bulb Starter Kit includes three LED light bulbs and the Hue Bridge. The Bridge is a hub that plugs directly into your wireless router and translates signals between your Wi-Fi-connected smartphone and the ZigBee-based bulbs.

You might wish Philips had found a way to eliminate the Bridge, like the purely Wi-Fi-based Lifx bulbs or Bluetooth-based iLumi. Those bulbs cost $89 and $79 a piece, respectively, which means that Philips' ZigBee-based solution, ($59 per when you buy them individually), seems to impart some cost savings. You can always pick up an extra-long Ethernet cable and hide the Bridge in a closet somewhere if you find it unsightly. If you think you'll expand into other connected home products like a Sonos system, or a smart lock or two, keep an eye on the forthcoming multidevice controller hubs that support Hue, like the one included with the Logitech Harmony Ultimate universal remote, or the Revolv Smart Home Solution Wi-Fi Hub due out later this year.

Once you've connected the Bridge and installed a few bulbs, you simply download and install the free Philips iOS or Android app, which will then prompt you to hit the Bridge's sync button. The app, Bridge, and bulbs should all find each other a few seconds later. Since the Hue kit has been on the market since fall 2012, you might receive a Bridge with outdated firmware. You can use the app to check, but you might also need to cycle the power once or twice before you get an accurate reading.

The official Hue app is not the most intuitive piece of software. Its primary screen displays a grid of preset lighting schemes (""recipes,"" per Philips) designed for all three light bulbs. Some recipes, like Reading, or Concentration, trigger familiar, utilitarian shades of white and yellow light. Others -- Sunset, Deep Sea, Kathy (?) -- dip into the spectrum of 16 million colors available to the Hue.

Select any of those presets and your bulbs will change almost instantly. Selecting also launches an onscreen brightness slider, framed by buttons to edit the preset, and to turn it off. Philips will let you monitor lights, adjust their brightness, and turn them on or off remotely once you've signed up and logged into the Web-based client. To make new presets or edit existing ones, you have to be on your home network.

Editing and creating new presets is where the Philips app experience can become cumbersome. Philips has spread the various customization functions across different sections of the app. The settings icon presents you with a simple, per-bulb color selection tool. But when you go to make a preset lighting scheme, Philips only lets you assign colors by choosing them from a reference image file. You can pull images from your photo library, or capture them in the app directly, or even download them from Philips' Web site, but without that source image, you have no way obvious way to assign a particular shade to a preset.

Once you do pick a color set, the app lets you assign specific behaviors easily enough. iOS users currently have more-robust options here than their Android-based counterparts (Philips says it's working on tying app development schedules more closely together.)

On the Android Hue app, you get the per-bulb lighting and brightness options, as well as basic scheduling. With the upgraded version 1.1 iOS app, Philips brings in advanced programming functions like the ability to set timed alarms. It also introduces geofencing, which will work in conjunction with your smartphone GPS to turn your lights off when you leave your home, and turn them back on when you return.

If Philips' app isn't perfect, it exposes enough features to make the Hue Connected Bulb interesting. Search ""Hue"" in the Apple Store or in Google Play, and you'll find apps that let you do even more.

Thanks to Philips releasing the Hue API and a software development kit for iOS and Android, you will find all kinds of alternative Hue apps available for download. Many of these are improved versions of the basic control screen. Hue Pro for Android and its intuitive interface is a good example, since it lets you set presets and see how they will affect every bulb right on the home screen. Other apps, like Ambify, Hue Music, and Hue Market, expand the Hue's programming functions to changing colors in time to music, or in response to changes in the stock market.

Like Belkin's WeMo home automation devices, the Hue also has its own IFTTT channel. IFTTT (If This, Then That) is an Internet-based standard that lets you tie online services to each other. The idea is that through a simple interface, you can create ""recipes"" that perform simple functions. You can then use your own recipes, or download recipes from others to do things like automatically back up your iPhone contacts to a Google Drive spreadsheet, or have a weather report show up automatically as a text message every morning.

Sign up for the Philips Hue channel on IFTTT's app or Web site, and you will find almost 500 different recipes. Some will seem frivolous (""Upload a photo to Facebook and set the mood in the room""), but many of them offer simple, but still useful notifications, like blinking the lights when you've been tagged in a Facebook photo, or changing colors to those of your favorite team when the game starts.

Along with all that potential, one pitfall is that with so many disparate apps triggering different lighting behaviors, it can be hard to track them all. If you're sick of a particular recipe or program setting, you might have to sort through three or four different apps before you find it to shut it down.

For all of that new-fangled connectedness, it's most important that the Philips Hue bulbs meet our basic expectations for standard home lighting. The good news is that they do.

The white, yellow, and blue-toned lighting (accessible via the Concentrate, Energize, Reading, and Relax presets) all have the familiar warmth and color tone of standard incandescent or utility bulbs. Each 8.5-watt, 600 lumen Hue bulb can shine with the intensity of a 50-watt incandescent. A single, undimmed bulb won't sufficiently light an entire 12x12-foot room, but two Hue bulbs should do the job.

You also don't need to worry about the range of a bulb from the Bridge. With the controller on one end of our appliance testing warehouse, and a bulb at the other, we put about 100 feet and five or six walls between them. We noticed no significant delay in responsiveness. A 1,500-square-foot house might put that many walls and a floor or two between the two pieces, but the longest distance might be more like 50 or 75 feet apart.

At $49 a pop if you purchase them individually, or $199 for the kit, the Philips Hue Connected Bulb has some useful conveniences, but it's also packed with some likely short-lived novelty. It's expensive compared with a CFL or a old school incandescent bulb. It's even pricier than many other LED bulbs, although not all of the Hue's competition is connected, nor as feature-rich. You can buy a $129 home automation hub from Insteon, for example, and one of that company's LED bulbs for $29, but they don't offer as many color options as the Hue. They're also not IFTTT-compatible.

On the higher-end, the Hue will face broader competition from companies like Lifx and its $89 Wi-Fi-based, hub-free light bulb, as well as the Bluetooth-based iLumi. Neither is in wide release yet, but both had successful crowd-funding campaigns, and should be ramping up production shortly. The novelty factor will make any of these bulbs a hard sell for some consumers. If you like the idea, though, the Philips Hue Connected Bulb nails the basics of lighting and ease of use, and also supports a robust set of extend functions. It's the connected LED light bulb to beat, particularly if you're an iOS user."
Belkin WeMo Switch + Motion review:|"

Belkin's WeMo home automation products offer the ability to control your home electronics from anywhere, and the WeMo Switch + Motion might be the most attractive package of the bunch. If it has a plug, you can plug it into the WeMo -- a lamp, a coffeemaker, you name it. Once you do, you'll be able to turn that device on and off from your phone.

Not to be confused with the WeMo Light Switch and its DIY-intensive installation, the WeMo Switch and its optional motion detector accessory are designed around plug-and-play simplicity, making them especially appealing to consumers who'd like to avoid breaking out their toolboxes. It only takes a few minutes out of the box to have your WeMo up and running, and once you do, automating devices around your home is as easy as tapping a button on your phone. You can even use IFTTT (If This, Then That) to find creative ways for your devices to interact with online services like Twitter, Facebook, and Google Drive.

The WeMo's best feature of all might be its price. At just $49 for the WeMo Switch, or $79 for the added motion-detecting functionality of the WeMo Switch + Motion, with no subscription fees for any of it, this is a home automation system that'll fit most any budget. It's also a great starter unit, especially considering that you can add additional WeMo Switches, Light Switches, and motion detectors to your network if needed. If you're looking to dip your feet into the world of home automation, or if you're a devoted IFTTTer, then you shouldn't hesitate to give the WeMo a shot.

Construction and designThe WeMo Switch's technology is encased in an unassuming white plastic shell that will blend in neatly with most home decor. It's a bit large, but if the WeMo is plugged into the top socket of a standard two-socket outlet, I found that the bottom socket was still accessible, at least to a normal-size plug. There are no guarantees that the WeMo will play nice on a power strip, though.

Aside from the physical on/off switch (which you can toggle remotely), there's just one other button on the WeMo itself: a small restore button stashed away on the top of the device that you can hold down for a few seconds to initiate a manual reset. Aside from that, every control you need is located within the WeMo's easy-to-use app. The same is true for the motion detector; simply plug it in, pull up the app, and you'll be on your way.

Speaking of the motion detector, it's small and unobtrusive, illuminating with a pale blue light whenever it detects movement. It's a nifty little gizmo that works well, with a design that looks a bit like a chess piece from an abstract, futuristic chessboard. And again, aside from the Restore button on the top of the plug, there are no physical controls to fiddle with. You can customize the detector's sensitivity, but -- you guessed it -- you'll do that from within the app.

UsabilityThe WeMo's secret weapon is the WeMo app, a free download for both Android and iOS devices. From the moment you plug the device in, the app will do 95 percent of the work, first guiding you through every step of the setup process. All you'll need to do is connect your phone to the WeMo, the same way you connect your phone to a WiFi network. Once you do, the app will ask for the password to your home network; type it in, and you'll be ready to automate.

The WeMo app lets you create rules to dictate when the switch should power on and off, or what should happen when something triggers the motion detector. For simple functions, like setting an appliance to power on at a certain time every day, or programming a lamp to turn on when the motion detector catches you walking into the room, these WeMo-specific rules will suffice, and the app makes them easy and intuitive to set up.

If you really want to unlock the WeMo's true potential, you'll need to take advantage of its other secret weapon: full IFTTT integration. IFTTT is a popular, useful, and absolutely free online tool that links your favorite apps, social networks, and Web services in order to create recipes -- ultra-customizable cousins to the WeMo's rules. Basically, IFTTT allows you to set up automatic triggers based on causality. If ""x"" happens, then ""y"" happens. To create a recipe, you just define what ""x"" and ""y"" are, then let IFTTT work its magic.

Here's an example: let's say I was looking to buy a used air hockey table. With IFTTT, I could set up a recipe that would automatically send me a text alert whenever someone local lists an air hockey table for sale on Craigslist. The Craigslist post is the ""this,"" and the text alert is the ""that.""

What's really cool here is that IFTTT allows you to set the WeMo as either the ""this"" or the ""that,"" thereby linking it up with each and every service with which IFTTT boasts compatibility. Imagine the possibilities. Instead of simply having the motion detector trigger the WeMo switch to turn a light on, you could have the motion detector trigger IFTTT to send you a text alert -- a useful way of letting you know when the kids are home from school every day. Or, if you're compulsive about sharing, you could have IFTTT automatically tweet ""Good morning!"" on your behalf as soon as the motion detector sees you step out of bed. Or maybe you want the WeMo to flash the lights when your favorite football team kicks off each week. Almost whatever you can think up, from the practical to the preposterous, WeMo and IFTTT can make possible if it involves some kind of online notification.

Thanks to the WeMo app, linking your WeMo devices to IFTTT is quick and painless, although IFTTT will require you to register a new account if you don't have one already. Once you do, it's easy to search through popular WeMo-based recipes, or to create your own, either on the IFTTT site or through its own handy app. My only gripe with this process is that you can't modify or even view these IFTTT-based WeMo recipes through the WeMo app itself. The chances are good that you'll probably end up using both WeMo rules and IFTTT recipes -- which means you'll need to use both the WeMo app and the IFTTT app to manage your devices. This also means that you'll never have a complete list of your rules and recipes in one place.

Performance The WeMo Switch + Motion did a satisfactory job in my tests, reliably doing what I wanted, whenever I wanted. Flipping the WeMo's switch using the smartphone app will yield a virtually instantaneous result over a Wi-Fi connection. If you're on 3G, it might take an extra second or two for your lamp to turn on. The app itself is typically fast and easy to use; it does, however, get a bit sluggish at 3G speeds.

Every rule that I tested on the WeMo worked perfectly well. It never gave me any sense of uncertainty about what to expect from it. If you set a light to turn on when you walk into the room, you can feel confident that it's going to turn on when you walk into the room. If it doesn't, the chances are that you've done something wrong, not the WeMo. Rest assured, though, the WeMo goes out of its way to make screwing something up a real challenge. It's not idiot proof, but it's close.

Integration with IFTTT is, for the most part, smooth. All of the recipes that I tested with the WeMo worked well -- with one exception. I created an IFTTT recipe to turn a lamp plugged into the WeMo Switch on and then off once every hour (you can do this through the WeMo app alone, but I wanted to test IFTTT, too.) This recipe worked as planned each and every hour -- the WeMo always turned the lamp on, then off. However, I also created a recipe to send a text message whenever the WeMo Switch turned on, even if it was turning itself on automatically.

These messages only showed up about three quarters of the time over a three-day period. The other 25 percent of the time, the lamp would turn on and off as scheduled, but IFTTT would fail to send a text. If that notification had been for something important -- say, an intruder entering your home -- a 75 percent success rate would hardly be acceptable.

As for the motion detector, it performed about as well as I could have hoped. Like the WeMo Switch, I had it up and running in no time, and throughout all of my testing, the only difficulty I really had was finding a flaw with the thing. The angular surface on top made the detector easy to aim, and the blue LED lights that shine whenever it's activated were informative without being irritating. There was never a time when it failed to detect motion that I wanted it to detect. If you ever find that it's detecting motion too easily, you can tweak the sensitivity level using the WeMo app. The app also lets you customize when the motion detector will actually activate the WeMo Switch. You can set it to only trigger a rule when it detects motion following a custom-defined period of stillness, for instance -- a handy feature if you want the lights to turn on when you come in after a long day of work and not when you come in from stepping out to check the mail.

Maintenance The WeMo is only intended for use in dry, indoor settings, so if you're planning on automating a device outside of your home, you'll want to find another product. Aside from keeping it dry, maintenance is something of a nonfactor, but in the event of technical issues, you may need to hold the Restore button down for a quick reboot. Belkin will also issue occasional firmware updates for the device, and carrying them out is about as easy as it gets; you'll receive a notice in the WeMo app, tap ""OK,"" then wait about a minute.

Service and support WeMo users with questions about the device can turn to Belkin's Web site for answers to frequently asked questions, as well as information about the WeMo's limited one-year warranty. In addition, Belkin offers WeMo purchasers 90 days of complimentary 24-7 phone assistance. After 90 days, you'll need to stick to the Web site or e-mail your questions in. You also have the option of purchasing an additional phone support plan, with one year of unlimited service calls costing around $120. You can also pay for service calls one at a time, but I wouldn't recommend it -- each one will set you back about $40.

ConclusionThe WeMo Switch promises to automate anything you plug into it, and on this promise, it delivers. With its remarkably simple plug-and-play installation and its intuitive, user-friendly app, the WeMo is a home automation option that even the most tech-averse consumers will enjoy using. Best of all is the price - at just $49 a switch, you won't have to break the bank to give it a shot. Throw in a motion detector for $30 more, and you've got a very attractive entry-level home automation package.

It's also easy to think up ways to put the WeMo to use - especially considering that it utilizes the full potential of IFTTT - but how many of these functions are really all that useful on an everyday basis? Some consumers might already have specific uses for the WeMo in mind that more than justify making the purchase, but for others, functions like turning a lamp on and off with your phone or setting up a Google Document that tracks every time someone walks into a room probably seem like little more than a novelty.

Chances are that you fall somewhere in between those two positions. If that's the case, I recommend that you tinker around with IFTTT a bit. If you enjoy crafting recipes and putting them to use in your everyday life, then it's a fair bet that you'll enjoy putting the WeMo to use, too."
Belkin WeMo Light Switch review:|"

The Belkin WeMo Light Switch replaces most single wall-mounted on/off switches and lets you control your lights from anywhere with an Internet connection. The switch connects to your home WiFi network, which then passes on control of the switch to Belkin's free WeMo mobile app. So as long as your phone is connected to the Internet, you can monitor and modify the light settings in your home with minimal effort. If your Wi-Fi is disabled for some reason, you can still physically turn your lights on or off the old-fashioned way.

I thought 50 bucks for a light switch seemed excessive at first, but it might just be worth it for some of you. It definitely makes more sense if you like to create preset schedules for your lights: think holiday decorations or a front-porch light. It's basically a modern way to automate your home lighting or other devices (ceiling fans, etc.) without having to mess with a dial timer. If you don't have a light switch that you like to program regularly, this is going to be more of a novelty for you -- albeit one that's fun to use and well-designed.

Construction and design The installation instructions Belkin provides on the box are misleadingly short, so I suggest skimming those briefly and then watching Belkin's installation video for all of the important details. The video will take you through the process so you can get this thing working and looking nice in your home as painlessly as possible.

If you're not afraid to flip a circuit breaker, installing the WeMo switch shouldn't be very complicated or time consuming. But others who are new to the oft-intimidating world of fuse boxes and wire connecters should offer a more experienced friend a couple of cold drinks in exchange for assistance. I finished the installation myself in 30 minutes, and I spent a good portion of that time watching the tutorial video and compulsively checking my fuse box and power to make sure I had turned everything off correctly -- actual installation time was probably closer to 15 to 20 minutes.

One issue you might come across is that the specific wires you find in your electrical box might not perfectly match what is mentioned in the video guide. For instance, not every electrical box has the typically white neutral wire, which is integral for this installation. Your best bet is to check the electrical box you want to set up before you buy the WeMo Light Switch. Another thing to be prepared for is that the back of the WeMo switch is larger than regular light switches, so it will take more muscle to tuck the wires far enough back for the switch to screw in flush with the wall.

After you install the hardware, you're ready to set up WeMo on your smartphone or tablet. Just download the free WeMo app (and the free IFTTT app if you want to get creative), go to your Wi-Fi settings, and WeMo should be among the list of available networks. Then fire up the WeMo app and follow the steps to complete the short configuration process. Belkin doesn't offer any Web-based versions of WeMo, but free mobile apps are currently available for iOS and Android platforms.

Usability Both the switch and the app are extremely easy to use. It's a push-button light switch, so press it on and a power light illuminates. Press it off when it's dark out and a faint night-light will appear. You can also operate the Belkin WeMo Light Switch using the WeMo app. The ""on/off"" button on the WeMo app turns green when the light is on so you can tell the difference between the two settings. There's not too much else to know about the WeMo's most basic function.

You can also program rules using the app. This is where Belkin crosses over into home automation territory. The rules section allows you to schedule the light to ""turn off or on only,"" so you could set it to ""turn on at 6 p.m. on weekdays."" You can also ""turn on then off,"" so you can program it to ""turn on at 8 a.m. and then off at midnight on weekends.""

There are plenty of ways to customize your Belkin WeMo Light Switch using rules, but if you want to go a step further, this product works with If This, Then That (IFTTT) recipes. We're really excited about that because IFTTT offers a lot of interesting, fun, and potentially useful custom settings for the WeMo Switch. You can read more about IFTTT here. The gist is that it's a free service that lets you relate functions across different applications and services. Since Belkin recently added IFTTT support to its WeMo products, you can now download user-made WeMo recipes for free. One existing IFTTT recipe available for download will blink the lights on your WeMo light switch when your favorite team starts playing a game on ESPN. You can also create your own recipes.

For testing, I programmed IFTTT to send me e-mails and tweets whenever my WeMo light turned on. Not everyone will care about the WeMo switch's IFTTT support, but it's really a blast to mess around with, and much less complicated than it may seem. It also lets you extend the WeMo switch's overall usefulness, for free.

Performance The WeMo switch and app both worked consistently during my tests. The basic on/off feature on the app was responsive, and it also handled special programming instructions well. I set several rules and IFTTT recipes that all performed as expected. It claims to work on a wide variety of Android and iOS smartphones and tablets, too. I can't vouch for them all, but I used an iPhone 5 without any issues. You can also use the same WeMo app to manage multiple light switches or any combination of WeMo home automation products.

Conclusion If you're intrigued, but aren't sold on WeMo, the $299 Revolv Hub is another interesting option that is available now for preorder. It merges a bunch of different home automation brands into one, multitasking app. It's still DIY in a sense, but much more comprehensive because it can tackle music, door locks, lighting, thermostats, and more all from a single hub rather than a bunch of different apps. There's also the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Hub for $99.99, which not only lets you use your smartphone as a universal remote, it's also compatible with home automation devices that control lighting, climate, and home appliances. Also, don't rule out the Philips Hue or similar connected single-bulb options if you want lighting that offers more that the WeMo's simple on/off functions.

At the very least, this light switch is fun and easy to use. At most, it's a useful product that can help you automate a small aspect of your home. There are so many customizable options with WeMo and IFTTT that this switch far exceeds anything you could pre-program with a lesser, plug-in light timer. Using two apps isn't as efficient as it could be, but they work so well together that we almost forget about the slight inconvenience."
Netgear unveils VueZone Night Vision Camera|"



LAS VEGAS--Netgear unveiled at CES 2013 the latest in its VueZone Home Monitoring product line, the two-part VueZone Night Vision Camera (model VZCN2060).

This is a tiny and completely wire-free camera that monitors based on motion detection, both day and night.

The new VueZone Night Vision Camera comes in two parts:  an AC-powered infrared lamp and the camera itself. The infrared lamp is required for the camera to work in darkness or low-light conditions. The two can be placed at different locations but still work together, as long as they point to the same location.  This design is rather unusual, since most night-vision cameras come with the infrared lamp bulit-in. Netgear says the reason for this is to keep the camera completely wire-free. Having an infrared lamp bulit-in would require an external power-source for long-term usage.

The camera use two standard camera batteries as its power source. Netgear says a set of two of batteries provides enough power for it to work for 60 days continuously.

The camera doesn't work all the time, however, but only when it detects motion.

The fact that the camera is completely wire-free means that you can place it anywhere you want, as long as it's within the range of the base station. You can have up to 15 cameras working with one base station with each being able to automatically detect motion, record an event, and send an alert. Users  can play back your recorded videos from anywhere on Apple iOS or Google Android smartphones and tablets, or via a Web browser.

Netgear's VueZone Night Vision Camera Home Monitoring system's features include:

The Netgear VueZone Night Vision Camera (model VZCN2060) is available now and costs $130; the price doesn't include the base station.

Easy one-click installation in 10 minutes or less with no tools required
Motion detection senses people up to 15 feet from the camera and sends an e-mail alert
Motion detection sensitivity can be adjusted to suit the environment
Infrared lamp strong enough for the camera to ""see"" up to 25 feet in the dark
Ability to save, store, and share videos via the Internet and on cloud-based storage"
Nest Learning Thermostat review:|"

Within a week of installing the first-generation Nest Learning Thermostat in my house last spring, I decided to buy my review unit rather than return it to the company. When a tech journalist pays $250 for a thermostat, you know it's a special kind of thermostat. Fast-forward seven months, and I'm still a devotee, so I was excited to get my hands on the second generation of the Nest Learning Thermostat.

Editors' note, April 29, 2013: I've updated this review since its original publication date to reflect the Nest 3.5 software update and feature additions. I've also added my year-over-year energy usage results after having Nest installed for long enough to test its conservation claims.

The newer Nest works off the same premise: because so few homeowners actually set up programmable thermostats, the Nest saves money and time by learning your household patterns and programming itself. The physical design of the second-gen device remains sleek and elegant, but Nest Labs took customer feedback to heart, making some physical refinements and working out compatibility with a wider range of home heating and cooling systems. The changes are simple, but pleasing. I'll update this review to cover those changes, but much of my experience -- and review -- remains the same.

To cut to the chase: the Nest works. In the first few days, the thermostat I tested figured out that despite our many comings and goings, my family typically likes the house to be 68 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, and an energy-saving 64 degrees when we usually go to bed around 11 p.m. Over time during my first run, the Nest cleverly differentiated between our weekday and weekend patterns and automatically heated up later on weekend mornings and ran throughout the day when we are more often home. As with the first-generation device, the second-gen Nest Learning Thermostat is strikingly easy to install without professional help, and it looks lovely on the wall.

But the startling joy of the Nest thermostat comes from the side benefits of a networked thermostat and from the attention to detail the Nest team has paid to design. The first-generation Nest Learning Thermostat was the most beautiful, intuitive home automation device I'd seen, and the new version tops the old. Like the iOS and Android apps, each Nest's internal software continues to receive updates years after you purchase the device, so these informative apps improve continuously.

Version 3.5 of the software -- available automatically on older Nest devices and apps on April 29 -- serves up an energy-use dashboard that should make a conservationist out of anyone. Plus, I can pick up my smartphone and use it to turn my Nest thermostat up from bed when I wake up in the morning. Other thermostats from Honeywell and Ecobee allow for basic, app-based remote control, too, but none with the simplicity and self-teaching of the Nest.

Nest's design: More iPod than thermostat 	 Nest Labs took the rectangular, button-littered digital thermostat and chucked it. Instead, the company took a page from the original iPod playbook (no surprise, since Nest was famously founded by former Apple engineers) and built the hockey-puck-size thermostat around a round screen. The entire housing, made of glass, plastic, and brushed aluminum, is a button and a scroll wheel combined. The second-generation device improves on the original by thinning the profile by 20 percent and making the entire housing one piece of stainless steel, so that it better reflects the colors of the wall behind it. All driving happens by rotating the entire thermostat and pushing to select. It's intuitive and satisfying to confirm choices with a subtle, muted clicking sound.

The round screen is bright, cheerful, and easy to understand, with heating and cooling designated by both color and by number. A green leaf shows up when you're making a temperature choice that Nest considers energy-saving. My kids can't stop touching the thermostat to explore the menus, and they instantly understood how Nest works. (Which is a bit of a liability, since the Nest is theoretically learning from all their enthusiastic fiddling.) My only complaint here, and it's a small one, is that the round interface doesn't leave quite enough room for some words in the setup menus, which leaves them awkwardly cut off or hanging beyond the borders of the screen.

All the Nest setup happens on the device itself, which is gratifying if you're the kind of gadget hound who wants nothing more than to get your hands on the gear and get it working. I would like to be able to change some settings remotely via the app -- typing in a long Wi-Fi key by dialing the bezel can take a while -- but really, once you've installed the Nest, you won't need to touch it often. I now primarily control the Nest from the Nest apps installed on both my phone and my iPad. (More on those charming apps later.)

Nest thermostat features lurk within 	 There's a lot going on inside the Nest Learning Thermostat, but you can't tell at first. Once you plug in the device and set the target temperatures, there's not much else to look at.

The Nest screen flickers on automatically whenever you walk by and learns from you every time you raise or lower the heat. After a couple of days, the Learning menu begins to show what the thermostat has picked up. It will set some initial schedule points (say, it will turn down automatically around bedtime) and will figure out how long it takes your heater or your air conditioning unit to reach a given target temperature based on past performance.

This target temperature calculation wasn't particularly meaningful in the first generation of the Nest. Read some Amazon reviews and you'll find -- especially for families living in extreme climates -- a lot of head scratching about why the Nest didn't use this feature to get a jump start on heating or cooling. Generation 2, however, makes the most of it.

Not only does the newer version work with a wider range of home heating and cooling systems (95 percent of the low-voltage market, according to Nest Labs' rep, now including two-stage AC units and three-stage heating systems), it now connects to emergency heating units and whole-home humidifiers. The Nest then uses the time-to-temp calculations to bring specific types of systems online when it's appropriate for that technology. Called System Match, the settings tell your Nest to make choices based on the type of heating and cooling units in your house. So, for instance, a radiant heating system that may take 30 minutes to raise the temperature 5 degrees in your home will come on well before your desired temperature change to make sure the house is comfortable exactly when you want it that way.

One of my favorite Nest features, besides being able to control my thermostat from anywhere, including my office and my bed, is the Auto Away feature. Because the thermostat senses motion around itself, it automatically shuts down your heating or cooling when you're away. The first-generation device took about 2 hours to declare you ""away,"" but the new Nest learns your family's patterns more precisely. In my tests, Auto Away does now predict absences faster, and I've been saving more energy year-over-year as a result since my family predictably leaves the house every day. The version 3.5 software update now predicts how long you'll be gone, too, so it can start heating or cooling before you return -- a welcome change in my book if it works, since this winter I found myself frequently returning to a colder-than-I'd-like house.

You can also set the temperature for ""away"" from your mobile device or browser, or manually on the Nest before you leave the house to conserve even more energy. If you want to change the range for Auto Away while you're on the road, you can do that from the Nest app, too. My only complaint here is that manual Away mode doesn't switch into auto mode before you come home -- this makes sense when you're on vacation or out of the house for a while, but I'd like semi-auto Away that I can switch off manually when leaving the house but that would prewarm or cool the house before my regular return time.

Apps to die for 	 One of Nest Labs' challenges with the Learning Thermostat is showing that once the thermostat has learned your patterns, there's something going on worth your $250. The Nest Learning Thermostat apps, available for use on iPhones, iPads, Android phones, and, with this release, Android tablets, go a long way toward letting you know you're paying for something.

The Energy History screen serves up 10 days of energy-use data porn, showing exactly when and how often your heat or AC powered on over the course of each day. An icon appears to give a simple explanation for daily fluctuations, indicating whether weather or your presence in the house made a difference in your energy use. When you see all that information spelled out, you can certainly see how much ""thinking"" the Nest does behind the scenes to mold itself to your patterns.

I actually think that this screen may do more for energy conservation with the Nest than almost any other feature. It's human nature to geek out on metrics, and seeing how your actions affect whether the Nest awards you a little leaf may drive smarter choices. (Did you set Away when you left the house? Or did you let Auto Away turn off the furnace on its own?) It's fun to play against yourself for energy savings -- to a point. After a few months of Nest use, though, I find myself checking in less and less often. Maybe that's because the novelty has worn off, but maybe it's because I trust the Nest to be doing its job and learning from me.

Unfortunately, the Nest ends its reports after 10 days, but if you sign up for a monthly energy use report, you'll get a regular (automated) e-mail detailing your Nest performance during the previous month and any energy saved. I'd love to be able to request -- even just through the Nest Web interface, where there's more screen real estate -- a year-over-year history so that I could evaluate how much money and energy I'm saving over time.

Energy savings 	 I've now been using the Nest for more than a year, and can report that as a result my energy use has gone down an average of 15 percent over the winter months, saving me about $70 per year for a 2,000-square-foot house. We don't cool our house in the temperate Bay Area, so all our savings have come from our heating bill. In a summer climate, I would expect to save more per year.

Those who have heating and cooling systems both hooked into the Nest likely find an added advantage. A Nest feature called Airwave takes advantage of the cold coils on your air conditioner and blows the fan over them even after your compressor shuts down, theoretically eking out every last bit of chill from the unit. I don't have AC in my home, so I can't test its efficacy, but the concept sounds smart and sound. The Nest 3.5 software also introduces the option to control a home's fan independent of the AC (to move air around the house creating a cooling effect without actually running the AC) on a set schedule or on demand.

Nest 3.5 introduces another feature called ""Cool to Dry,"" which helps homes in extremely humid climates keep the moisture out of the air when humidity reaches mold-inducing levels but without running the AC for any longer than it would take to reduce the humidity to mold-safe levels. And in certain markets, Nest Labs now partners with local utilities to offer automatic rebates or to let those utilities create even-more-efficient cooling profiles on days when peak energy use may be a problem for the utility or the community. These programs are all completely optional for the user, and you can read more about them at the Nest Web site.

Installation is easy, as long as your home's wiring isn't weird  	  The Nest Learning Thermostat doesn't work with all houses, but there's a tool on the Nest Web site to help you determine whether your current wiring will work with Nest. It took me one peek at my thermostat and about 30 seconds online to figure out that I could install the device.

Nest says that you'll be fine installing the thermostat yourself if you're comfortable installing a light fixture, but in some ways, a Nest is even easier to install than a lamp. The Nest base (the part that accepts the wires from your furnace or AC unit and snaps under the Nest dial and screen) comes with a built-in level, and has reverse clips that hold the wires so that they're easy to work with with your fingers. The box comes with a wall mount (in case your wall, like mine, needs painting under your old thermostat and you don't have time to patch paint), screws that work in both wood and drywall, a screwdriver (with all the bits you may need neatly tucked into the handle) for a variety of situations, and handy labels to help you remember which wire is which. I found that I still needed to break out my cordless drill, though, to drill holes in my wood wall.

The entire original Nest installation took me no longer than 15 minutes -- until I snapped on the faceplate. Theoretically, the wires from your furnace to your thermostat power the Nest, but mine didn't power on. It turns out that, through no fault of the Nest, my 60-year-old home was wired with a bizarre set of switches and had speaker wire completing part of the circuit. Thankfully, Nest Labs telephone tech support was quick, friendly, and exceedingly patient while helping me troubleshoot the problem.

The lesson here is: all houses are different, so be prepared for quirks, especially in older homes. But irregularities could crop up with any home wiring project. Nest offers a concierge service for $119 per device if you'd rather not take the risk, but seriously? You can do it.

Once I fixed the problem, the Nest powered on, walked me through setting the location (for weather reports) and jumping on my home's Wi-Fi, and I was off to the races. It took me much less time to set up the Nest Learning Thermostat than it does to figure out the settings and boot up e-mail accounts on a new smartphone.

Conclusion 	 In a market flooded with $20 programmable thermostats, a $250, high-end thermostat is a hard sell no matter how beautiful. A startup with a lot of attention, Nest Labs has leaned into quality to justify the price; everything about the Learning Thermostat screams classy and thoughtful. If you love the look and feel of high-end design, you won't regret the investment, although you'll start to feel the money bleed if you have a two-zone heating and cooling system and shell out for more than one Nest. If you don't already closely track your energy use, you'll probably make the money back over time, too, but it might take a few years."
WiLife LukWerks Starter Kit review:|"



Want to keep an eye on the babysitter, your couch-chewing dog, or the outside of your home while you're away on vacation or at work? Well, you could check out a less expensive Webcam, but most Webcams are designed for video chat (though Creative is moving into surveillance Internet cameras). If you're interested in a security-oriented and full-featured system, WiLife's LukWerks Digital Video Surveillance System (DVSS) is worth a look. DVSS is a power line-connected system that uses your AC wiring for network connectivity and your PC for control of up to six cameras. It worked quite well in our hands-on evaluation, and the bundled Werks software is slick. But at $299.99 for the single-camera starter kit we tested and $229.99 for each additional camera, you're looking at a hefty $1,500 investment for a full, six-camera setup--pricey, though $1,500 is a bargain compared to a professionally installed surveillance system.

It's obvious from the precise bundled documentation and the plethora of stickers attached to components telling you what to do or what not to do that WiLife has spent a lot of effort making the setup for the LukWerks DVSS as simple and bulletproof as possible. There are quite a few components staring back at you from the newly opened box: the camera, two power-outlet networking modules, and a slew of cables and mounting hardware. Once you've figured out which of the similarly and attractively styled components is which, getting the system wired is a pretty simple affair. The camera can be suction-mounted on a window or another flat surface, and precise instructions tell you how to keep it stuck there. You can also install the camera on a supplied hard mount that allows camera angle adjustment, albeit manually. The eyeball of the camera itself provides about 45 degrees of deflection in any direction, as well as adjustable wide-angle viewing. Also, there's a stand, if you wish to simply set the camera on top of a flat surface.

The LukWerks DVSS uses your home AC layout for network connectivity, and you can plug in the camera's powered Ethernet relay module to any receptacle in your home or office. The receiver connects to your PC via USB. Many universal power supplies and other devices that clean up power signals can interfere with communications signals, and the included documentation warns about that. WiLife recommends plugging the modules directly into the wall, though we did fine with simple capacitor-protected power strips.

Software setup was lengthy process, with reboots to install .Net and the Werks control application. We also had some minor issues during setup on two mature XP machines, but the effort and the wait were worth it (unfortunately, the product is currently compatible only with Windows systems). During the installation process, you can designate how much of your hard disk space you want to devote to video recordings, and the feed is recorded as compressed WMV files. The Werks utility is attractively designed and easy to use, and it provides all the control over cameras and security you need. With it, you can adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection (within the entire viewing frame, or a subframe), instruct the system to send warnings to an e-mail address or a cell phone or handheld device when motion is detected, and view camera feeds live, as well as relay them to the Werks Web site. For remote viewing, you'll need to set up an account at the WiLife Web site: your home PC will serve video feeds to WiLife's server, and you can watch from any Internet-connected terminal by logging in to your account.

Unfortunately, it took a number of calls to and from WiLife to get Werks to establish contact with the WiLife site so that we could register and view the feed from our single test camera. However, our pain is your gain, and after a WiLife application engineer entered the fray, a new configuration was e-mailed our way, and quick as you can say "".Net is timing out,"" we were able to see the feed online. The fix won't be integrated into Werks until the next release, but you can get it from tech support if you experience the same problem.

We did have a few, decidedly minor, beefs with the LukWerks system: the software always defaults to Internet Explorer no matter which browser you normally use; you can't disable the Ethernet or secondary activity lights on the camera (for complete stealth); and the program doesn't autodetect cameras the first time you boot--we thought there was a connection problem until we realized we had to add them manually. And while we understand the security benefits of having to log on to the LukWerks service, having the option to view each camera via its own IP address would be nice as well.

On the other hand, the video from the camera is quite good, and you may adjust it from 5 frames per second (fps), 320x240, 150Kbps to 15fps, 640x480, 800Kbps, depending on the speed of your connections and needs. From our location, lower settings offered much better performance when viewed online, but your mileage will vary with your connection.

WiLife covers the hardware with a one-year warranty. The WiLife LukWerks Web site is among the most lucid and straightforward we've seen, as is the help you'll find there. Toll-free phone support is available 24/7, or you can fill out a Web support form to request help--with a promise that a support technician will contact you within 24 hours. The site also has FAQs, a tips-and-tricks section, and downloadable software, firmware, and manuals."
D-Link DCS-2100+ wireless Internet camera review:|"



Review summaryIf you want to keep an eye on your home or office without stringing wires everywhere, D-Link's DCS-2100+ wireless video camera can help. It gives you acceptable pictures and the ability to receive an e-mail alert if anything moves. Getting it all to work is a two-hour job, but it's worth it because the excellent suite of surveillance software can monitor as many as 16 different cameras. D-Link's DCS-2100+ has built-in Wi-Fi, and it connects directly to 802.11b or 802.11g networks. It lacks a zoom function and a remote control, but the DCS-2100+ is the best low-cost surveillance system we've seen. The package comes with a camera and a stand, an AC adapter, and a six-foot Cat-5 cable. A CD contains the installation and surveillance software; for documentation you get a well-organized and thorough, 102-page manual and a handy, 10-page start-up guide.

The initial installation requires plugging the camera into AC and connecting it via a wired Ethernet connection to a PC running Windows 98 SE or later (sorry, no Macs). Then you run the IP Installer from the CD; it sniffs the network for the camera, then launches a wizard that lets you change the IP address and configure the camera's wireless settings. After you have configured the camera to join your network, you can pull the Ethernet plug and install the camera anywhere within range of your wireless network. The included stand and mounting bracket make the physical installation easy. The camera doesn't take batteries, so you'll need to have an AC outlet within range of its six-foot power cord.

The camera's single, green LED glows, showing it's ready. Open an Internet Explorer window (the camera requires IE 5 or higher) and enter its IP address; a stream of 320x240-pixel video appears, complete with a time and date stamp. It can also send 160x120 video.

The core of the software package is the IP Surveillance suite, which has Monitor and Playback programs and provides a slew of recording and viewing features. The application is easy to install and run, but it takes up the entire screen, and the image stretches awkwardly to fit anything other than a traditional 4:3 display. You can view as many as 16 different video streams in a variety of formats. The DCS-2100+ has a good feature set that includes a motion detector and the ability to monitor up to 16 cameras simultaneously. It can alert you of intruders via e-mail, or it can start an external application that can make a recording or play an alert sound. You can't remotely aim, focus, or zoom it, though.

The DCS-2100+ transmits acceptable-quality (30 frames per second) video, with excellent sound synchronization. Under the best of circumstances, its output has a red cast to it in spite of an automatic white balance, and in a dark setting, the output is grainy, black-and-white video. The camera is not weatherproof, so you must mount it behind a window to monitor outdoor areas."
Veo Wireless Observer review:|"



The Veo Wireless Observer is a $300 pan-and-tilt camera that can stream live video and audio across a local area network or the Internet--without a computer.

The camera's oblong, UFO-shaped head rests on a rounded stand with a servo-controlled motor for panning and tilting. The Observer can sit on any flat surface, or you can wall-mount it with the included plastic bracket. Veo also threw in a specialized jack for connecting an optional motion detector, which is available separately for $30.

The bundled setup software was fairly straightforward, though we would have preferred a user-friendly USB connection to the old-fashioned nine-pin serial connector, which, for good reason, has all but disappeared from modern PCs. Once you've input the Observer's wireless settings (IP address and WEP password), placed the unit within range of a wireless-network access point, and plugged it into an AC power outlet, the camera is ready to operate independently of a PC. Security-conscious users can also choose multiple usernames and passwords to supplement the network's WEP security key. Even with our old NetGear router, we needed just a couple of minutes to enter everything necessary for accessing the Observer from any Internet-connected PC.

You can toggle video resolution between 640x480, 320x240, and 160x120, and the camera features a 2X digital zoom. The image is acceptably sharp, but the frame rate tops out at a less than optimal 10 frames per second. The adjustable brightness control helps with low-light shooting. The streaming audio, however, isn't worthy of even bad AM radio.

The Observer's greatest strength is its easy-to-use remote interface. When you access the camera's IP address from any computer on the network, Internet Explorer automatically installs an ActiveX plug-in that provides you with streaming video and a simple, straightforward point-and-click control panel. From there, you can adjust the 120-degree horizontal pan and the 60-degree vertical tilt, as well as record AVI videos and take serviceable JPEG snapshots. A separate, more-robust Observer Studio client is also included, as is support for up to four cameras on the same network.

If you're looking for flexible placement options, remote-controlled movement, PC-free operation, and easy access from anywhere on the Internet, the Wireless Observer fits the bill. You may also want to consider similar wireless products from D-Link and Hawking Technologies, and if you have a wired network, check out Veo's Ethernet Observer, which is nearly identical to its wireless counterpart and costs $100 less."

Nest Cam IQ review: (wn5aa)|"

The $299/£299 Nest Cam IQ is unquestionably smart, but I can't recommend it as readily as Nest's other security cameras. My main reason? Price.

Like the $199/£159 Nest Cam Indoor and Outdoor, the indoor-only IQ has 1080p HD livestreaming, a 130-degree field of view and advanced motion-sensing smarts. It also relies on the same Nest app and works with the same smart home partners.

The IQ's key differences are improved two-way audio and a larger 8-megapixel, 4K image sensor. The 4K sensor allows for 12x digital zoom and a free, IQ-exclusive feature called Supersight that focuses in on faces for an up-close look at who's in your house.

While the IQ has more advanced specs and features than any Nest cam to date, I'm not sold on its value. If you don't mind paying more for this specced-out camera, go for it -- you will see a little more detail in the live feed. Regular ol' 1080p (without a 4K sensor) will likely do the trick for most, though.

Follow these steps to get your Nest Cam up and running:

Many of these steps are optional, but enabling them all gives you full access to your Nest Cam's features. Providing your address, for instance, allows the software to track whether you and the rest of your family are home or away. This initial configuration process should take only a couple of minutes.

Now you're in your Nest app, but your camera hasn't been connected just yet. Here are the next steps for getting your Nest Cam IQ connected to your local Wi-Fi network:

This may seem like a lot of steps, but most of them are very straightforward. The whole process should take less than 10 minutes, assuming your Wi-Fi network is strong and connects easily. Note: Always confirm the strength of your Wi-Fi connection where you plan to install your camera; a sluggish network can inhibit the live feed and other important features.

Nest Aware is a contract-free service that costs $10 per month for 10 days of continuous video storage or $30 per month for 30 days of continuous video storage. (It's £8 or £24 in the UK respectively.) Learn more about Nest Aware here.

Nest Cam Indoor and Outdoor customers have to pay for Nest Aware to get access to features like Person Alerts, a type of notification that tells you when it sees a person (but not who it sees). Nest Cam IQ customers get this feature for free, as well as the IQ-exclusive Supersight. Supersight harnesses the IQ's powerful 4K image sensor, 12x digital zoom, as well as HDR (high dynamic range, for improved picture clarity) to track faces around a room.

Both Person Alerts and Supersight worked quite well, letting me know it spotted someone and zooming in on their face so I could ID them. If these two features are particularly important to you, the Nest Cam IQ's value improves slightly (since you don't have to pay for Nest Aware to access them). But, you'd still have to pay for Nest Aware if you want to review saved video footage. Note: Nest now offers all Nest customers 3 free hours of event history, but saved as snapshots of activity, rather than video clips.

And, like Nest's other cameras, the IQ works with IFTTT, Nest's own Works with Nest platform, and Amazon Alexa (soon). Check out my post on viewing security camera feeds from the Amazon Echo Show for more details on the Alexa integration.

All of these features worked well during my testing, but three improvements stood out the most. First, you can see more detail than ever before with the IQ's 4K image sensor, including facial features that were previously fuzzy. Enabling Supersight, also called ""Close-up tracking view"" in the Nest app's settings, allows the camera to zoom in on motion to capture a close-up view of a person's face.

Two-way talk is easier now, too, thanks to Nest's speaker upgrade; carry on a conversation with a family member remotely -- or tell your puppy to stop chewing on your shoes.

The biggest upgrade, though, is Nest's new Familiar Face Alerts feature. Note: Familiar Face Alerts are only available on IQ cameras with a Nest Aware subscription.

Familiar Face Alerts help you distinguish between friends and family -- and everyone else -- through an image database. When it detects a face, you can say whether or not you recognize the person to help train the system and improve its detection capabilities over time.

The $299/£299 Nest Cam IQ is a solid camera with an equally solid app interface for accessing the live feed and making adjustments to features. But at 100 bucks more than Nest's indoor and outdoor cameras, the IQ strikes me as prohibitively expensive.

That's especially true when you take a closer look at the features it adds. Yes, your live feed will have a bit more clarity, and you'll have free access to Person Alerts and Supersight. But are these features necessary for the regular DIYer who wants some security benefits, but is mainly checking in to see what their dog gets up to during the day? Probably not.

The Nest Cam IQ has potential, but it just isn't quite worth the cost for most buyers today. Bump the price down, though, and Nest might really have something."

Samsung Connect Home: A Google Wifi clone with a SmartThings twist|"

Looking for something with the easy installation of a Google Wifi or Eero mesh router system, but with a SmartThings hub built in? You'll be able to get one soon.

Samsung's first Wi-Fi system, the Connect Home, will be available for preorder at Best Buy on June 4 at $170 for a single unit or $380 for a pack of three. (Pricing and availability for the UK and Australia are not yet available, but $170 equates to about £130 or AU$230.)

The Connect Home is a midtier (2x2 MU-MIMO 802.11ac) system that's very similar to the Google Wifi. If you get a pack of three, one unit connects to your broadband modem and the rest of the units work as network extenders, making a seamless Wi-Fi network with a large coverage area. Each of its identical units has two network ports. In similar products with this design, the goal has been to make it easier for the average consumer to cover an entire home with a strong wireless networking signal.

Also available for preorder on June 4 is the Connect Home  Pro that costs $250 per unit. The Connect Home Pro shares the design and features of the Connect Home but supports the top-tier Wi-Fi  spec (4x4 MU-MIMO 802.11ac) and hence has much faster Wi-Fi speeds. You can get up to five Pro units to setup a home mesh, or use it interchangeably with as other Connect Home units.

Like other Wi-Fi systems, the Connect Home is connected to a mobile app you use to set up and manage your home network. Samsung has some big ambitions for this app, however. Apart from managing the Wi-Fi network it will also enable users to manage -- including the setup process -- Samsung-branded smart household devices, ranging from cameras to large appliances. The router also works as a hub for Samsung's SmartThings home automation system, and the app will let you program and control SmartThings-compatible devices from third-party product makers.

This unified approach has been a long time coming. Since Samsung acquired SmartThings in August 2014, this is the first time Samsung has united its own connected large appliances with SmartThings-compatible products in the same hub hardware and support application. This means you won't need a separate SmartThings Hub anymore.

Samsung says the new Connect Home has built-in Zigbee and Z-Wave -- popular light-weight wireless standards for home automation -- and is compatible with hundreds of third-party smart home devices, such as Philips Hue Lights, Netgear Arlo Camera and Ring Video Doorbell.

If the device and the software work as expected, you will just need the Connect Home to control your entire home, and have Wi-Fi at every corner. It's a win-win.

Both the Samsung Connect Home and Samsung Connect Home Pro are available for purchase on July 2nd. Check back then for their full review.

Feit Electric HomeBrite Bluetooth Smart LED System review:|"

Hubs. Who needs 'em?

Not Feit, that's for sure. Last year, the manufacturer gave me an early look at its line of HomeBrite-branded smart LEDs that use a Bluetooth mesh network to sync up with your phone and with each other. That means you don't need a control hub plugged into your router in order to control the things.

The obvious limitation with Bluetooth bulbs is that you need to be within Bluetooth range (about 50 feet) in order to interact with the lights on your Android or iOS device. With some Bluetooth bulbs I've tested -- most notably, the C by GE Life and Sleep LEDs -- that also means that prescheduled lighting changes won't work when you aren't in range.

Fortunately, that isn't the case with Feit's bulbs. They're smart enough to remember your schedules even when you aren't home, and if you've got multiple bulbs, they'll stay synced while you're away, constantly pinging and re-pinging each other to help keep track of your settings.

Couple that with the fact that HomeBrite's lineup includes bulbs that don't commonly come with built-in radios (a candelabra LED and an outdoor-rated PAR38 floodlight, for instance), and you'll start to see the appeal of these lights. With HomeBrite's baseline bulbs selling for a relatively low $15 each, I think they might make sense for anyone looking for simple lighting smarts in a fixture or two. However, a lack of compatibility with third-party systems along with glitchy, imperfect performance in my tests has me stopping short of recommending them outright.

The HomeBrite lineup consists of five options:

I tested each one out in our lighting lab, where we use a spectrometer and an integrating sphere to measure things like brightness, color temperature, and the way heat build-up affects each bulb's performance.

The HomeBrite bulbs were a bit dim for my tastes, with the A-shaped bulb coming in at 672 lumens, well below the 800 or so that you'd expect from a common 60W incandescent. The candelabra bulb was on the dim side, too, with 277 lumens to its name -- slightly below average in the candelabra class, at least among 40W replacements.

The bulbs did an impressive job with heat management, though. All LEDs will see slight performance dips in the first hour or so of use as the bulbs heat up. Each of the HomeBrite bulbs saw less of a dip than average, with none of them ever dipping below 90 percent of their initial brightness. That's a very good result, and one that speaks well to Feit's hardware.

A common A-shaped bulb for $15A B10-shaped candelabra bulb for $19A BR30-shaped floodlight for $20A weather-rated PAR38-shaped outdoor floodlight for $30A recessed fixture retrofit kit for $35

I also liked the clean, simple designs of each of the bulbs -- at least for the most part. Even by LED standards, that decorative candelabra bulb is fairly enormous.

This brings us to the HomeBrite app, which features a clean, simple design in its own right. Whenever you open it, it'll scan for your mesh network. If your bulbs are powered and in Bluetooth range, you'll be able to turn them on or off, dim them up and down, schedule them, group them or set a quick timer until they turn off or on.

As far as scheduling goes, that's about as comprehensive as Bluetooth bulb controls get. The only thing that's really missing is full RGB color control, as well as tunable color temperatures along the white light spectrum, which you'll find with the similarly priced C by GE Sleep LED, another Bluetooth option.

Using the HomeBrite app is fairly intuitive. You'll swipe from side to side to swap between bulbs or groups of bulbs, then turn bulbs on or off with a tap. Adjusting the brightness is a bit finicky, though -- you have to rotate your finger along a thin radial wheel in a movement that's awfully similar to those side-to-side swipes that switch to a different bulb. I can't tell you how many times I tried to adjust a bulb's brightness during my tests only to accidentally swipe over to the next bulb. I never got the hang of it, and I'm not sure that I ever would.

I also don't like that the app wasn't accurate with the status of my bulbs. I'd leave a bulb on and then find it listed as ""off"" in the app. Not terribly helpful.

The app is also sluggish at times. Whenever you tweak a setting or adjust a schedule, it'll take at least several seconds to sync everything up with your bulbs. If you plan on doing a lot of scheduling, plan on waiting on a lot of spinning wheels. Fortunately, simple on/off and dimming controls are perfectly snappy.

Something else to consider on the smarts side of things is third-party compatibility. As of right now, there really isn't any of it to speak of with these smart bulbs -- no HomeKit, no Alexa, no Nest, no SmartThings, no IFTTT.

What that means is that you won't be able to turn the bulbs on and off with voice commands, or trigger them with motion detectors, or sync them up with a smart hub so you can control them from beyond Bluetooth range -- or any number of other things that third-party compatibility would bring into the picture. HomeBrite is a pretty solid little system, but it's also a walled-off one that won't play nice with any other smart home gadgets you might own. That, more than anything, feels like the limiting factor here.

For a quick smart lighting fix, Feit's bulbs would work well -- especially for tricky spots like chandeliers, sconces, and outdoor fixtures, where your smart bulb options are limited. Credit to HomeBrite for covering the bases and offering the widest variety of smart bulb shapes on the market.

That said, if you're looking for smart lights that'll fit into a larger connected home setup, then the HomeBrite bulbs likely aren't the lights for you. They don't play well (or at all) with other smart home gadgets, nor will they work with the kinds of smart-home platforms that would let you control the lights from outside of Bluetooth range. For anything more than basic control and automation, Feit's bulbs fall short."

Yale to offer new keyless smart locks|"

Editors' Note: Updated July 24, 2014 with additional pricing and availability information.

Yale will soon be expanding its lineup of keyless smart locks, the Connecticut-based company announced today. Available by next month, the new locks are promising a smaller design, simplified installation, and ""one-button enrollment"" into existing Z-Wave networks.

Along with a new touchscreen model similar to  the one we reviewed last year , Yale is putting out a less-extravagant push-button variation, too. That's a first from the Yale Real Living line of keyless locks, which up until now have been touchscreen only.

Sacrificing that touchscreen seems like a sensible way to bring the price point down, and that's exactly what you get with the push-button model, which will retail for $200. That's $75 less than the previous, touchscreen-only generation's MSRP, and about $20 less than what you'll spend on the  Kwikset Kevo .

Still, the touch-to-enter Kevo has an undeniably higher ""cool factor,"" so it would have been nice to see Yale push the price of its comparatively less exciting lock down further still.

Coded entry brings some pretty intriguing functionality to your front door. Setting temporary codes for guests and house workers seems like an especially good idea, as you can easily delete the code as soon as you don't need it anymore.

Some home-automation networks might even regulate the specific dates and times when specific codes will be accepted. Another potential perk is the ability to automate smart devices simply by locking or unlocking the deadbolt -- a great way of turning on connected lights or appliances as soon as you get home.

A decent home-automation system should also be able to give you alerts if the lock's batteries are starting to run low, so that you can replace them before getting locked out. Even if you're using no such network, Yale's lock will flash you warnings when the battery is about drained. Should you ignore them and get locked out anyway, you'll still be able to connect a 9V battery to the exterior of the lock, giving it just enough juice for you to enter your code and get inside.

Yale tells us that the push-button model (B1L) will be available as soon as this month, with the touchscreen model (T1L) following a few weeks later at a price of $240. Yale sells locks in Australia and the UK, but tells us that neither of the two new models will be made available outside of the US."

Yale to offer new keyless smart locks (n0ctr)|"

Editors' Note: Updated July 24, 2014 with additional pricing and availability information.

Yale will soon be expanding its lineup of keyless smart locks, the Connecticut-based company announced today. Available by next month, the new locks are promising a smaller design, simplified installation, and ""one-button enrollment"" into existing Z-Wave networks.

Along with a new touchscreen model similar to  the one we reviewed last year , Yale is putting out a less-extravagant push-button variation, too. That's a first from the Yale Real Living line of keyless locks, which up until now have been touchscreen only.

Sacrificing that touchscreen seems like a sensible way to bring the price point down, and that's exactly what you get with the push-button model, which will retail for $200. That's $75 less than the previous, touchscreen-only generation's MSRP, and about $20 less than what you'll spend on the  Kwikset Kevo .

Still, the touch-to-enter Kevo has an undeniably higher ""cool factor,"" so it would have been nice to see Yale push the price of its comparatively less exciting lock down further still.

Coded entry brings some pretty intriguing functionality to your front door. Setting temporary codes for guests and house workers seems like an especially good idea, as you can easily delete the code as soon as you don't need it anymore.

Some home-automation networks might even regulate the specific dates and times when specific codes will be accepted. Another potential perk is the ability to automate smart devices simply by locking or unlocking the deadbolt -- a great way of turning on connected lights or appliances as soon as you get home.

A decent home-automation system should also be able to give you alerts if the lock's batteries are starting to run low, so that you can replace them before getting locked out. Even if you're using no such network, Yale's lock will flash you warnings when the battery is about drained. Should you ignore them and get locked out anyway, you'll still be able to connect a 9V battery to the exterior of the lock, giving it just enough juice for you to enter your code and get inside.

Yale tells us that the push-button model (B1L) will be available as soon as this month, with the touchscreen model (T1L) following a few weeks later at a price of $240. Yale sells locks in Australia and the UK, but tells us that neither of the two new models will be made available outside of the US."

Logitech re-enters the security cam ring with the Circle 2|"

Logitech is back with not one, but two totally redesigned versions of its original Circle security camera (video above) -- the $180/£169 wired Circle 2 and the $200/£199 battery-powered Circle 2. Both Circle 2 cameras are available for preorder now at Logitech.com and are scheduled to ship in July.

The wired and the wire-free Circle 2s share the same core camera tech:

While Logitech's Circle 2 cameras have identical specs, they have slightly different designs and optional accessories. The wired model relies on a power adapter 24-7; the slightly larger wirefree model has a built-in rechargeable battery that's supposed to last for up to 3 months. So, unlike the Netgear Arlo Pro or the Canary Flex, you have to specify which Circle 2 you want when you buy -- the two models are not interchangeable.

I'm not sure why Logitech decided to offer two separate models rather than one indoor-outdoor camera that can either be connected to an adapter or rely on battery power when needed. Logitech took that approach with its first-gen Circle camera, but its battery life was limited to just a few hours. By comparison, Netgear's Arlo cameras and the Canary Flex are supposed to last for months without being connected to a power cord.

I like this approach, and sort of wish Logitech had simply improved the Circle's battery life. We'll know more when we get our hands on a couple of Circle 2 cams for testing later this summer.

In addition to all of the basics, the Circle 2 cameras come with a lot of optional add-ons ranging from $30/£26 to $50/£52. They include a window mount, a plug mount, a weatherproof extension and additional rechargeable batteries. I'd definitely like to see a 4G cellular mount as an option, but this is still a pretty comprehensive lineup.

Check back soon for our impressions of the Circle 2 camera. We'll not only compare it to the first-generation Circle (which will no longer be sold), but also to the Arlo, the Flex and Nest's indoor and outdoor cameras. Stay tuned.

Ion the Home review:|"

Ion began selling  	 action cameras  in 2012 -- you know, the GoPro kind that you tether to yourself or to your gear to capture first-person footage. But after a couple years of helping folks record daring stunts, the company has expanded into home security. That's where the Ion the Home Wi-Fi camera comes in.

This entry-level DIY camera will be available at Walmart and on  	Ion's online store in early November for $130 and in the UK in 2015 for £150 (Australian availability has not yet been announced, but pricing would convert to about AU$150).

While its free cloud storage option is very appealing and its other features, like night vision and two-way talk, put it in-line with competitors, the app isn't currently able to send push or email alerts and the live stream doesn't display correctly in a horizontal, landscape view in the iOS app. Since real-time alerts and quality live streaming are critical components of an app-enabled DIY security camera, it's very difficult to recommend Ion the Home right now.



Most of the cameras we've reviewed have fee-based cloud storage that starts around $10 per month. The $200, £200    champions this system (but only in North America): you can pay Dropcam $10 per month for seven days of continuous footage or $30 per month for 30 days. Even Ion the Home's identically priced competitor, the    (£130 in the UK, and AU$170 in Australia), charges $10, £6, or about AU$12 per month for its basic cloud service.

has a lower monthly storage option, but few are ever free.

Icontrol's US-only $200 Piper and Foscam's $220, £135, AU$230 F19826P are two exceptions; Icontrol will save 1,000 clips and Foscam will save 30 clips or 100 photos for free.

Ion appears to be following suit with its base-level storage option: free, rolling 24-hour cloud service. That is, after storing 24 hours of footage, the first hour will be deleted to make space for new video clips. And, if 24-hour video storage isn't enough, Ion will also offer payment tiers identical to Dropcam's for seven days and per month for 30 days.

Here's a chart comparing Ion the Home to some of its competitors:

In addition to Ion the Home's free cloud storage option, I was impressed by its entry-level price point, 720p image quality, night vision and two-way talk. Unfortunately, its lack of push and email alerts severely limit its functionality. What is the benefit of on-the-go app access if you can't receive alerts as potential security breaches take place?

Ion the Home does a fantastic job recording clips whenever motion, sound and ""tamper"" activity is detected (tamper activity refers to any perceived attempts to disable the camera, such as moving the camera itself), but it simply saves the clips, rather than notifying you that an event has occurred. Ion says it is working on ""adding alerts outside of the app (email/text)"" by the end of 2014, but said nothing about in-app push alerts being en route.

This limitation is fine if you just want to periodically check in on Fido, but even the live stream was problematic. I used a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an iPhone 5 to test out the mobile apps, after trying the app on a first-gen   , only to find out that it wasn't compatible with tablets. The Android app's live feed was very good in both portrait and landscape view. Not so with the iOS app. It looked fine in portrait view, but was completely unusable in landscape view.

The 720p resolution did deliver a decent image in both day and night vision modes, although, that doesn't mean much if you want to use the iOS app. Its portrait orientation was fine, as you can see below, but the horizontal view is obviously important if you want to see more details on-the-go.

I like that the mobile app lets you record a video clip, take a photo or use two-way talk straight from the video feed. This was simple to use and worked extremely well. Press the record button once to start recording and again to stop. When it's done, it will save your clip alongside all of the motion, sound and tamper-related clips. Photos are saved to your phone's photo library.

The camera itself looks nice, with a white (or black) plastic finish and a base that moves inward toward the camera for optional wall mounting. This design is similar to Arcsoft's Simplicam, although you can't pivot the Ion the Camera's base in the same way.

Setup was mostly painless. I plugged in the power adapter -- the power input on the camera is located in a slightly awkward spot, making it unnecessarily difficult to plug in -- downloaded the mobile app and created a username and password. From there, the step-by-step process lasted less than 10 minutes.

It walked me through entering my local Wi-Fi username and password, pressing the ""set"" button on the side of the camera, sticking the app in front of the camera to scan a QR code (this took a couple of tries) and waiting for it to connect. It connected after about a minute and I was able to access the app and its live stream.

Ion the Home doesn't have an IFTTT channel and it doesn't work with any third-party smart home products. Belkin's NetCam HD+ is the same price, but works with WeMo products. The NetCam HD+ doesn't have a free cloud storage option, but it's definitely a more compete entry-level DIY camera, and equally affordable if you don't pay the monthly cloud storage fee and simply want to watch the live stream on occasion.

The $130, £150 Ion the Home security camera, bound for Walmart stores and Ion's online store in early November and the UK in 2015 has some good things going for it. The free cloud storage option is a huge plus, a vast improvement on the Belkin NetCam HD+'s cloud service, which starts at $10 (or about £6 or AU$12) per month. It also has features that you'd only find on pricier models -- 720p, night vision, two-way talk -- but the lack of push and email alerts is a definite deal-breaker. Add to that its wonky live streaming view in iOS and Ion the Home isn't an home security camera I can recommend."

Logitech Pop Home Switch Starter Pack review:|"

As the smart home market grows, convenience is becoming one of the biggest measures of success for any given gadget. Sure, you can control your smart LEDs with your phone -- but if it's not easier than using a conventional light switch, who cares?

With that convenience in mind, Logitech released the Pop, a device that controls your smart home gadgets with the ease of a button press. The Logitech Pop works like most other connected buttons, sending personalized commands to smart home gadgets with a single, double or long press. And it works particularly well in homes with multiple occupants and a bunch of smart home tech already built in.

Although the device can't quite rise above the competition because of the high price for its limited uses ($100 or £120 for the starter pack, $40 or £35 for each additional button), it will find a home with many people because it works so well with particular smart home ecosystems.

The Logitech Pop Starter Pack includes two buttons and a plug-in bridge. It works very simply: The buttons connect via Bluetooth to the bridge, which connects using Wi-Fi to the rest of the devices around your house.

This setup might seem simple, but it's unique in the smart button market. Many competitors anchor themselves to particular phones, rather than a hub. For instance, with the Flic ($94.50 at Amazon.com) smart button,  Mom might not be able to control the lights while Dad is out of the house, because the button relies on his phone to translate its Bluetooth signal into a Wi-Fi command the Philips Hue lights can understand.

Logitech deftly sidesteps this issue by using a hub -- making the Pop a more flexible device for multiple users.

Here's the full list of devices that work with the Logitech Pop:

It's not a huge list of partnerships (it's comparable to the more affordable Flic's), but the integration with IFTTT vastly expands the capabilities of the Pop button. You can not only control smart home gadgets, but you can toggle any device or service that works with the IFTTT platform -- which includes cloud storage services and communication apps, not to mention even more smart home devices. A smart button adds convenience, but it must be flexible enough to accomplish what diverse users want, and IFTTT brings that flexibility.

Lights: Philips Hue, Lifx, InsteonLocks: AugustPlatforms: IFTTT, SmartThings, Lutron, Belkin WeMoLogitech: Multiple hub-based Harmony remotes

But the Pop really shines when integrating with Logitech Harmony remotes. Using these devices, you can set up ""scenes"" that will turn on your TV, select the correct input and activate your preferred streaming service (assuming you have a compatible TV and streaming device). With this cooperation, the Pop can pretty easily become a Netflix or HBO button -- a feature I would use daily.

The one weakness in the Pop's feature list is its in-app behavior. Competitor Flic has over 50 functions built into its app -- everything from having your phone read texts aloud (Android-only), to toggling your music, to ordering a pizza. Pop users can accomplish many of these tasks using IFTTT, but that takes extra time, and discourages the sort of mix-and-match experimentation that makes smart buttons so fun.

The second problem is that too many of the Pop's features rely on other devices. Harmony hub remotes can cost hundreds of dollars, compatible TVs cost hundreds more, and streaming devices add another hundred to the bill. If you've already got such a setup, the Logitech Pop might be a nice addition. But the Pop in and of itself isn't really offering this sort of connectivity -- it just adds convenience to existing integrations.

This is the weakness of smart buttons in general: They're only as powerful as the tools at their disposal. And that's why it's important for them to offer flexibility and convenience at a low price. For the Logitech Pop, there lies the rub.

Competitor Flic costs $34 for a single button. That's a much easier pill to swallow for people who just want to try out this type of device. Paying $100 is a serious buy-in (£120 is even more serious if you're in the UK), and it's one that might not be worth it, if you don't have a certain suite of products and a particular smart-home setup that will work well with the Pop.

I like the Logitech Pop. Its design is slick and minimalist. Its features open up fun possibilities. I still love pressing a button and watching my lights turn red, my TV turn on and Netflix start up. If you have a lot of compatible devices, the Pop could be a really cool addition to your smart home.

But for those who don't have other Logitech gadgets, the Pop isn't the best smart button out there. It doesn't boast the same flexible in-app features as other smart buttons, and it costs more."

August Smart Lock (2017) review:|"

August's $149 third-generation Smart Lock is proof that you don't have to spend a ton of money for a solid smart lock. While it has a more traditional design, much about this lock remains the same. You can install it in minutes flat, it relies on the same August app as before and, like August's new $279 Smart Lock Pro, this simpler version also comes with DoorSense. DoorSense is a new feature that tells you whether your door is open or closed.

What's missing here is compatibility with Apple HomeKit and Z-Wave. If either of those things matters to you, don't get this lock. But, if you're torn between it and August's Pro, this model is still compatible with Amazon's Alexa speakers, the Google Home and Nest's thermostats for way less.

Note: Add a Connect Wi-Fi module for an extra $79 if you want to control your Smart Lock outside of Bluetooth range. That takes your total up to $228, which is still about 50 bucks less than the Pro. You need an August Connect to operate your lock via Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant.

Three key things separate this lock from the second-gen August Smart Lock:

I also noticed that this lock's motor is louder when you're controlling it remotely from the app or with voice control. It wasn't distractingly loud, but it is worth keeping in mind.

DoorSense worked great during testing, clearly displaying the state of the door in the app.

Everything else works the same as the previous August lock. You can control it remotely from the app, or with Alexa -- or Google Assistant. It was straightforward and responsive, if not a little noisy.

If you don't anticipate wanting to use Siri voice control and you'd rather connect to the lock via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (with the addition of a $79 Connect accessory, not included), August's $149 third-generation Smart Lock is a really strong choice. It still comes with DoorSense and all of the other same smart integrations (minus Siri and Z-Wave).

Want more options? Consider August's $279 Smart Lock Pro. Not only does it come bundled with the Connect Wi-Fi module, it also has DoorSense, as well as compatibility with HomeKit and Z-Wave.

Design - August took a more traditional design approach here than with its previous cylindrical lock. This version sports a more oblong shape, with less hardware and a thumb latch you rotate to lock and unlock the door manually. I don't mind this product's design, but it is a little less inspired than August's original design, now exclusive to the Smart Lock Pro.

DoorSense - Like August's Pro Lock, DoorSense comes with the Smart Lock. One of the benefits of a smart lock like August is its ability to autolock a door for you. But, what if you accidentally leave the door open? That's exactly where DoorSense comes in. Now, your lock will let you know two things: If the door is locked or unlocked and if it's open or closed.

HomeKit - The third-gen Smart Lock is now August's entry-level model. As such, August stripped out some of its features, including compatibility with Apple HomeKit. You can still use an Alexa speaker or the Google Home speaker if you want to control the August Smart Lock via voice commands, though."

Poly-Control Danalock review:|"

The $179 Poly-Control Danalock (available in the UK for £250 including VAT, not yet available in Australia) comes with both Bluetooth and Z-Wave capabilities. And although Z-Wave integration is limited to the Vera Gateway home-automation hub, Danalock's closest competitor, the $250 US-only  August Smart Lock , doesn't currently offer remote access at all.

Even with this additional feature, the less expensive Danalock falls short at every step. It looks similar to August, but feels significantly less sturdy; it was more difficult to install; the app isn't especially intuitive; I never received a notification, and its knock-to-unlock feature, a setting that's supposed to let you ""knock"" on your smartphone to unlock your front door, never worked. These factors make the Danalock difficult to recommend, especially when stacked against the highly rated August.

Danalock is designed to work with most existing deadbolts, so it should be as basic as removing the thumb turn from your current lock and attaching Poly-Control's version. That's part of what gives this lock -- and August -- so much appeal; you don't have to mess much with the hardware guts at all, you're really just adding additional stuff to your current setup. And that's exactly what we experienced with August, but it wasn't so easy with this lock.

The Danalock site boasts a four-step process that's supposed to take you from start to finish -- unmount the current lock, mount the adapter plate, mount Danalock and download the app. Although unmounting my old lock and downloading the app were straightforward, the adapter plate and Danalock mounting were much more involved.

I first tried to install this lock at our office on a door that we use specifically for this type of testing. After  following the quick start guide and installing the lock, everything looked right, but the deadbolt wouldn't turn. It sounded like it was trying to turn, but wouldn't budge. I confirmed that the deadbolt itself wasn't faulty and read through the more detailed user manual to find that the tailpiece was the culprit.

The tailpiece is a skinny piece of metal that rotates when the key is turned -- or when the motor inside a smart lock turns it -- and is a major deadbolt component. As part of the existing lock, I wouldn't have expected to run into an issue with the tailpiece.

However, the Danalock manual does specify that, ""Many doors have tailpieces that extend 10-15mm from the doorplate, and are more than 5mm wide. These will fit the Danalock without adjustments."" However, ""other doors have tailpieces that are square-shaped or less than 5mm wide. For these types of tailpieces we strongly recommend you cut the length so the tailpiece aligns with the door surface,"" and it is implied that this type of tailpiece also extends 10-15mm from the doorplate, although that wasn't directly stated. The manual continues, ""You then need to insert one of the tailpiece extenders you find in the Danalock package.""

Aside from the somewhat confusing language, I measured the tailpiece to find that it did fall between 10 and 15mm, but was just shy of 5mm wide. That means that I would have needed to use a separate tool to cut down the length of the tailpiece. Although this could be an easy enough fix for some, most households don't have the right tools for this sort of adjustment just lying around. And since a lot of folks would probably enlist the help of a locksmith at this point (making it a bit more than a basic DIY installation), I decided to uninstall the Danalock and try my luck on a different door.

The second attempt went much more smoothly, as the tailpiece was wider and flush with the door. I was able to add one of the plastic extenders included in the kit and get it working without having to perform surgery on the tailpiece itself. Even so, the adapter plate's holes were somewhat wonky (as in, they didn't line up with the screw locations well in either install) and the location of the screw holes for mounting the Danalock to the baseplate were not especially easy to reach.

In short, August's sturdy build, intuitively designed baseplate and various adapters made for a much simpler setup.

After getting Danalock up and running, I ran into a variety of other issues. While there's a log in the app that notes when you lock and unlock the door from the app, it doesn't list manual adjustments. The log is the only way to see your lock's current status -- if it's either locked or unlocked -- but it leaves out those times when you use a physical key from outside or manually lock or unlock the door from inside.

That means that there's no way to confirm the current status of your lock from the app, so you're left wondering if you did in fact lock the door the last time you left home.

If you forget your phone, you can always use a regular key to lock or unlock your door from the outside. And from the inside, there's a sensor-button in the center of the Danalock. Press it for an instant to lock the door and for a bit longer -- roughly 1 to 3 seconds -- to unlock the door. This worked pretty well, but it did feel as though the lock was struggling to turn against the deadbolt, accompanied by a sound that suggested it was straining slightly.

The Danalock user manual also adds that you should be able to manually rotate the lock from inside your house to mimic a thumb turn; this worked well with August, but I had no luck with the Danalock. It would rotate up to a point and stop without ever actually locking or unlocking the deadbolt.

The three settings within the app are ""None,"" ""Autounlock"" and ""Knock to Unlock."" None is the most basic default and it's one you can always use even if you've also enabled Autounlock or Knock to Unlock. It lets you press the red lock button and the green unlock button within the app to lock and unlock your doors -- given the significant Bluetooth lag time, this didn't seem all that different from spending a moment to search for your keys, but this feature was still the most reliable.

Autounlock is supposed to automatically unlock your door when you get within the Bluetooth range, which I found to be roughly 30 feet. This worked on some occasions, but not others. The manual notes that a pocket or other signal barriers could cause disruptions. Even holding the phone in my hand, I'd often get to the door to find it still locked.

There's also a potential safety concern with this feature. If you're using auto-unlock and are walking around your house with your phone, you're probably traveling in and out of the set Bluetooth range. That means that your door could unlock when you don't want it to. This did happen to me on one occasion, but Poly-Control says you can disable the feature when you return home and enable it again later. This isn't ideal, though, because the hands-free nature of Autounlock is negated by having to disable it the moment you get inside your house.

The Knock to Unlock feature is supposed to let you ""knock"" on your connected phone to unlock your door. This never worked for me. I enlisted help from the user manual, double-checked my settings, but never did get it to unlock my door.

While it's easy enough to select from the various unlock options within the app, the notification and settings options displayed below each one cut off text. Pressing the ""i,"" or information button, to the left of the descriptions will provide the full text, but that's an annoying extra step.

Also, I enabled all notification options within the app, but never once received one. If I had wanted to receive an alert when someone opened my door, I would have been totally out of luck. Even if it did work, the app's log doesn't pick up on those times when the deadbolt is manually locked or unlocked, so it would presumably only send a notification if someone used the app to get inside.

And although the lock settings let you customize its direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) and degrees of rotation (10 to 1,000), I still ran into several instances where the lock didn't rotate fully. This often required a second attempt to fully lock or unlock the door.

The only performance similarity between Danalock and August were the Bluetooth lag times; it wasn't enough to make the otherwise impressive August unusable, but for Danalock it was just another source of frustration.

Poly-Control's $179, £250 Danalock was a hassle from start to finish. Its installation is more involved that you'd expect, the lock doesn't always complete a full rotation, the Bluetooth had a fairly significant lag time, the Knock to Unlock feature didn't work at all, I never received an alert and the lock itself made a straining sound that suggested it was working really hard to turn my deadbolt. All of this combined to make for a pretty tedious smart-lock experience, one that made returning to my actual key a real relief."

Shortcut Labs Flic review:|"

If you had a button that could do anything, what would you make it do? In my ideal smart home, that button would simplify otherwise complicated automation: press it once, turn off the lights; press it twice, turn on my game console; hold it down, order a pizza. And as it turns out, Flic, a smart button from Sweden-based Shortcut Labs, does exactly that and more.

Flic started as an Indiegogo darling in 2014, and received over eight times its funding target (nearly a million dollars). Now it's making its way into the wide world of smart stuff, priced at $34 (about £24 and AU$47) per button or $99 (about £70 and AU$147) for four. The concept is simple: take a Bluetooth-enabled button, put it anywhere you want, and connect it to every app and device you can imagine. And it works, for the most part. Flic is a great product, especially for Android users and UK residents, and it looks like it will only keep getting better with each new partnership it adds.

An integration device like Flic is all about the partnerships. Shortcut Labs has partnered with Spotify, Logitech, Philips Hue, LIFX, Unified Remote, WeMo, Sonos, Zapier, IFTTT and even Domino's. Yes, that means you can order a pizza with the press of a button -- if you live in the UK. Users in the US will have to wait for that feature to cross the Atlantic.

The big question is this: Should you buy Flic? And the answer is, probably. It's relatively cheap -- if you get the four-pack, it's about $25 (£18 or AU$35) each -- and the button has something for everyone. That said, Android devices have around 50 Flic functions at present, as opposed to 27 functions on iOS devices. And UK users will get that awesome pizza-button function, whereas US and Australian users will have to wait for that. So some people definitely get a more flexible product out of the box than others.

But even living in the US with an iPhone, I can think of plenty of use cases for these Flic buttons. I can't cover everything these little gadgets do. Instead, here are a few ideas I had, and how they worked out:

I put Flic on the inside of the CNET Smart Home's front door. With one press, I can turn all the lights in the house on or off. With two presses, I can make my phone sound in case I can't find it. I would add the Domino's function if it were live in the US right now, but it isn't. This is one feature that I'd like to see debut as soon as possible.

I put Flic in my car to control phone communication in a safer way. With one press, I can send a text to my significant other that I'm on my way home. With two presses, I can call her. And with a long hold, I can have her response read aloud by my phone. All of these are easily accomplished on an Android phone, but iOS couldn't read the texts aloud, and required some workarounds using IFTTT to accomplish the other two. Despite those problems, the phone control in the car (perhaps in tandem with a second Flic to control my phone's music while driving) is one of the most useful I've found thus far.

Flic buttons come with clips that allow you to attach them to your clothes or a backpack. So I tested out Flic as a safety device, imagining how a kid or elderly adult -- or even just a student who has to cross campus alone at night -- would use it. With one click, I can call a friend. A double click automatically sends my location to a few select contacts. And a long hold sets off an alarm on my phone. I liked these features, but ran into some performance problems. The location-sending feature only worked consistently with my Android device, and it sent the location using a Google Maps URL that was always split between two text messages, making it impossible to just open by tapping. Right now, I wouldn't trust Flic enough to use it as a safety device.

Flic isn't a perfect product at this point. Because the buttons work on Bluetooth with your phone, users have to always carry their mobile devices with them. Additionally, the iOS version of the app is much less developed than the Android version. In fact, the app must be running in the background on iOS devices for Flic to work. Finally, features that would really make Flic stand out aren't quite here yet. Yes, in the UK you can order Domino's. But I want to see Flic partner with more food services, and bring those partnerships to the United States, Australia and other countries.

Even accounting for all those problems, Flic has undeniably high potential, just by merit of its flexibility and affordability. I'm excited to see these smart buttons continue to get smarter."

Meural is a screen that brings fine art to your home|"

Most people (me included) don't have the money to collect art. But for art lovers and collectors, there's nothing quite like hunting down the perfect piece to hang behind that love seat or over the mantle. Meural is a device for those in between: the people who might not have the time or money, but still recognize the beauty of a painting. And while Meural isn't bringing art to the people, per se (it costs $600), it is making personal curation of art just a little more accessible.

Here's how it works: you hang up the poster-size frame in your home, and the LCD display can pull up one of over a thousand paintings from various artists. Then, using motion-tracking technology, users can either swipe their hand right or left to cycle through pieces, up to reveal information about the piece or down to hide that information.

It's a simple interface, but the real magic is in its visual design. Meural, according to its developers, doesn't look like an LCD display. Its backlighting is dynamic, making both better contrast and optimization for different media (such as oil on canvas) possible. The result should look like a real painting -- one that could cost a couple hundred dollars -- but can be changed at no cost. You can even upload your own work and play films and GIFs like you might see at the MOMA in New York.

Meural is a cool concept -- especially for millennials like me who are interested in art, but don't have the capital to cultivate their own collections. It's already shipped an initial offering of units, but since receiving more independent funding, its developers plan to expand its availability considerably."

Reinvent your sleep cycle with Hello's Sense|"

Hello is a San Francisco-based collective that recently launched a Kickstarter campaign for Sense, a $99 smart sleep system. Sense consists of three parts: a spherical alarm that sits on your nightstand, a disc-shaped movement-tracker that you stick to your pillowcase, and an app for both Android and iOS devices.

The acoustic mesh-wrapped sphere comes in either cotton (white) or charcoal (dark gray). It can play white noise or other restful sounds to lull you to sleep and sound an alarm when it's time to wake up in the morning. Thanks to its minimalist, button-free design, the alarm is supposed to turn off with a simple hand wave.

The alarm has another intriguing feature -- it's adaptive. If you set your alarm to 7:30 a.m., but Sense senses that you're waking up naturally around 7:15 am instead, it might go ahead and turn on the alarm. It may seem counterintuitive, but Hello thinks it would be better to wake you up when you're already half awake rather than letting you (potentially) fall back into a deeper sleep and risk feeling groggier at your regular 7:30 a.m. wake-up time.

In addition to functioning as a sleep machine and alarm, the Sense sphere also has several built-in environmental sensors. That means that it can keep an eye on ambient light, temperature, humidity, sound, and particulates like dust and pollen in your bedroom. Then, it can use that information to help you better understand the reason behind any sleep disturbances.

Hello calls its movement trackers Sleep Pills. These small accelerometer-and-gyroscope discs are designed to be attached to pillowcases to track movement throughout the night. I'm not sure how well a Sleep Pill would stack up against a particularly restless sleeper, but Hello says they are are pretty tough; they're even waterproof in case they take any accidental trips to the washer.



The Sense app lets you review the quality of your sleep from the previous night by assigning a score on a 100-point scale. Basically, it gathers all of the data collected by the Sense sphere and Sleep Pill and uses it to inform you about your sleep patterns. If the bedroom temperature was particularly high and you had more trouble sleeping than usual, that information should be relayed to the app. If the noise sensor picked up on a sound disturbance at 2 a.m., you should be able to listen to a recording to find out if it was a car backfiring or your partner's snoring (I foresee potential arguments with this feature).

Hello hopes its Sense sleep system will be viewed as a welcome alternative to wearables like   Fitbit  or   Jawbone  -- or apps like the $1  Sleep Cycle, which require you to sleep with your phone in the bed. Hello's more minimalist approach doesn't shy away from tech -- it relies heavily on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth -- but it wants overt tech, like bright screens to take a backseat in the bedroom, where relaxation is key.

Sense has secured more than $150,000 as of this writing, far exceeding its original $100,000 goal. A pledge of at least $99 (that's roughly the equivalent of £58/AU$105) will get you a Sense sphere and one Sleep Pill; an additional $15 charge will apply for shipping outside the United States. There are still 29 days remaining on the campaign, so get one soon if you're interested -- Sense preorder prices will increase to $129 once the Kickstarter funding period ends."

Withings Body Cardio Scale review:|"

The Withings Body Cardio isn't your typical smart scale. While it can measure weight and sync its data online like Withings' other scales, this new version's selling point is being able to measure cardiovascular health. This is the first scale that can measure Pulse Wave Velocity, a term I wasn't even aware of before. It's a measurement used to determine arterial stiffness and is said to be a key indicator of heart health.

In addition to this new metric, the Body Cardio can also measure weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), body fat percentage, total body water percentage, muscle mass, bone mass and standing heart rate. And since it's a smart scale, there's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to automatically upload your information to the Withings HealthMate app on Android and iOS.

All of this sounds appealing, until you you consider the $180 (£140, AU$290) price tag, which makes the Body Cardio one of the most expensive consumer scales on the market. After using it for close to a month, I wasn't sold on its value.

The scale failed to measure my Pulse Wave Velocity on numerous occasions, and even when it worked, I still found it hard to decipher what its value was to my everyday health. I recommend the more affordable Withings Body smart scale for $130 (£100). It's essentially the Body Cardio, but without the standing heart rate data and the finicky Pulse Wave Velocity measurement. Trust me, you won't miss them.

Pulse Wave Velocity is used in clinical tests, research labs and some hospitals. My personal cardiologist and three others I called in New York City didn't measure it, but studies have found it to be a reliable measurement for heart health.

To determine your Pulse Wave Velocity, the scale is equipped with special sensors that are said to be able to determine the exact moment when blood is ejected from the aorta and when it reaches blood vessels in the feet. The time between the two is then compared to your height (which you provide during the initial setup of the scale) to determine your Pulse Wave Velocity, a number that is measured in meters per second. If your eyes glazed over during that explanation, you're not alone.

The entire process of measuring this and all other metrics takes about 30 seconds from start to finish. Unfortunately, it didn't always work. About one out of every five times I received an error that stated the scale was unable to measure my Pulse Wave Velocity, but I didn't know this until I opened the app on my phone. That's because the small display on the scale only shows weight, BMI, bone mass, muscle mass, standing heart rate and a timeline of past weigh ins. It doesn't actually show the Pulse Wave Velocity measurement.

My Pulse Wave Velocity was found to be between 6.8 to 5.9 meters per second. The app classified this as ""normal"" for someone my age and gender. I would have assumed it would be higher due to my high cholesterol, but I was unable to verify the accuracy of it because testing isn't widely available.

But after reviewing the number, I wasn't sure what to do next. Withings had said the app would offer personalized feedback, but to me it seemed vague and kind of generic. It mentioned how losing weight helps improve Pulse Wave Velocity, and a second tip said that a diet high in vegetables and low in processed food could do the same. None of this made me feel like Pulse Wave Velocity had become an important, life-changing metric for my daily health.

Sure, I could maybe lose 5 to 10 pounds, but I already have a relatively healthy diet. Withings should know that, considering the HealthMate app syncs with MyFitnessPal, a popular nutrition tracking app that I use religiously. I was hoping for something a little more substantial. This is the kind of generic information I could have received from a simple Google search.

The design of the Body Cardio is appealing (for a scale), and it works while sitting on both hard floors and carpet. It can automatically recognize up to eight different users, and can display the weather (when connected to Wi-Fi) as well as your previous day's steps if you use a Withings fitness tracker. An added perk is the built-in battery. The Body Cardio features a microUSB port for charging, but the battery should  last up to a year.

Aside from the mixed experience I had with Pulse Wave Velocity, I found weight and body composition measurements to be on par with other scales I tested. I did notice some fluctuations with standing heart rate, though. On multiple occasions it measured my heart rate at over 100 beats per minute, even though it was actually closer to 60 bpm.

I wouldn't recommend the Body Cardio until the flagship Pulse Wave Velocity feature is improved, or justified. Even then, $180 would be a hard sell without truly personalized feedback.

There are better scales out there, especially if you are already invested in the Fitbit or Garmin ecosystems. The Fitbit Aria and Garmin Index Smart scales are both solid choices.  If you aren't already part of an ecosystem, the more affordable Withings Body is worth checking out. You don't need the heart measurements in the Body Cardio."

Fizzics Waytap review:|"

Six of us gathered around the Fizzics Waytap. We each held two glasses of Avery's White Rascal -- a Belgian-Style White Ale with notes of coriander and orange peel. One glass came straight from the bottle, the other glass was poured through Fizzics.

The $130 (£100, AU$175) Fizzics Waytap uses sound waves to shake up the bubbles of your beer. The goal -- make bottled beer taste more like it came from the tap at your favorite bar. It's the same tech as the original $170 (£135, AU$230) Fizzics we tested last year, but the Waytap sports a slimmed down, classier design.

We sipped from both glasses, and the results confirmed my suspicions -- for better and for worse, the Waytap works as well as the original Fizzics, smoothing out the flavor of your beer with the power of science. This process accents sweeter flavors, and mutes the bitter end of the taste spectrum. It makes the beer bubblier and adds a nice head to make it appear like it was poured from the tap, but it's not quite the same thing. Our group was split on the results -- three preferred the White Rascal straight from the bottle (including me), three liked the Fizzics version better.

The Waytap doesn't fix my issues with the original Fizzics, but it's still a good product, and now it looks better and costs less. So if you like experimenting with your beer and especially if you value sweeter flavors -- I'm happy to recommend the reasonably priced $130 Fizzics Waytap. If you're looking for an exact replica of beer on tap, or if you want to stick with the beer as the brewer intended, this isn't the product for you.

Any skepticism around this product is of course justified. Using sound -- not carbon dioxide or any other gases or flavorings -- to improve the taste of bottled beer sounds like a complete load of crap. Check out my review of the original -- after my first Fizzics beer, I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. Fizzics isn't pseudo-science or a simple placebo effect, it really does make a difference.

As it turns out, the science of Fizzics -- the same as in the Waytap -- is fundamentally sound. Brewing laboratories use machines called sonicator baths create a similar effect. Those labs do it to flatten the beer for tests, but the beer's fizz rises dramatically when sonication first starts. I suspect the Waytap does something similar, just in much smaller doses.

Since it doesn't use any gas canisters or kegs, part of the appeal of the Waytap -- like the Fizzics -- is how simple it is to set up and use. You need four AA batteries, your bottle or can of beer, and a glass. That's it.

Pop off the Waytap's lid by pressing the button on the front, put your open can or bottle on the base, then replace the lid -- making sure the metal hose in the center runs into your beer. Grab your glass and pull the handle.

The Waytap gently pours your beer while agitating the carbonation with sound. Fizzics digitally controls the flow while it pours and keeps most of the carbonation intact by keeping the bottle under pressure. When your glass is just about full, push the handle away from you and the Waytap will up the sound intensity and add a frothy head to the top of your glass.

You can clean the Waytap just by running a glass of warm water through the system. The mat and base also separate so you can hand wash them. On average, it took me two to three minutes after I poured one beer before I was ready to pour the next -- and that's when I was using two different beers. If you're pouring multiple bottles of a single beer for guests, there's no need to clean between bottles.

You can buy the attractive, easy-to-use Fizzics Waytap for $130  from Brookstone, Amazon, and in certain Target and Best Buy stores. Right now, the Waytap is only available at US retailers, but Fizzics.com will ship it anywhere in the world.

Almost everything I described above is the same on both the Waytap and the original Fizzics. The only significant differences between the two are the price and the look. Again, the original Fizzics is $170. The Waytap is $130. The Waytap is slimmer and lighter (3 pounds/1.4kg vs 3.5 pounds/1.6kg). It's also much more attractive. It has the look of a sleek bar tool that would blend in with a number of decors.

I liked the design of the original Fizzics when I reviewed it last year, but the Waytap makes the original look bulky and industrial by comparison.

The one drawback of the new Waytap vs the original Fizzics -- it can't fit growlers. Waytap holds 12 or 25 ounce cans and 12 ounce bottles. The original Fizzics holds all of that, plus bigger bottles and cans, all the way up to 64 ounce growlers.

Fortunately, the Waytap isn't replacing the original Fizzics -- it's just adding to the company's lineup. Deciding between them is simple -- if you often bring home growlers, get the Fizzics. If not, go with the Waytap.

Here's a quote from the Waytap's successful Kickstarter campaign, ""Waytap converts the beer's natural carbonation into densely compacted, uniform Micro-Foam bubbles unlocking the true taste of any beer...""

The company's obviously bragging, but as a beer snob, I take offense to the idea that changing the way a beer was meant to be carbonated helps unlock its ""true taste."" And Fizzics does change the texture of your beer -- smoothing out the carbonation. With the White Rascal mentioned above, some coworkers found that to be a good thing. Fizzics reduced the ""bite"" of the beer. I missed that sharpness in the Fizzics version, as did two of my other coworkers with a penchant for Belgian style beer.

We also tried a dark beer -- Left Hand's Milk Stout -- and a hoppy beer -- Flying Dog's The Truth Imperial IPA -- with the Fizzics Waytap. I preferred the original bottled version with these beers too, but I was in the minority on both. With the IPA in particular, I didn't like how the Waytap blunted the bitterness of the hops, but my coworkers found the original too hoppy and liked the Fizzics effect.

With Left Hand's Milk Stout, Fizzics accents the sweeter flavors already in the beer to great effect. I still slightly preferred the balance of the original, but I'd be happy if a bartender poured me either glass.

For the review of the original Fizzics, we tried a macrobrew -- Bud Light -- and took Fizzics to a bar for a side-by-side taste test with beer from the tap. Fizzics did give the Bud Light a boost, but couldn't live up to the taste of an actual draft beer.

The original Fizzics surprised me quite a bit. I really wasn't expecting it to do anything, but it genuinely transforms your beer into something livelier and smoother using sound waves. The second version of the Fizzics -- the Fizzics Waytap -- is cheaper, slimmer and more attractive. For $130, it's well worth a buy if you want to change up your beer routine and impress your friends with pours that look like they came from the tap. It's perfect for beer lovers who like to tinker.

It's less perfect for beer snobs like myself. Like the Fizzics before it, the Waytap doesn't perfectly replicate a draft beer, and it changes the texture of the beer and the balance of flavors in its attempt at imitation. It never ruined a beer in my opinion, but it does take something away from hoppy beers in particular. I wish Fizzics had addressed this issue with the Waytap, but a cheaper, more attractive, and equally capable product as the original is still something worth drinking to."

Fizzics Waytap review: (i4vpk)|"

Six of us gathered around the Fizzics Waytap. We each held two glasses of Avery's White Rascal -- a Belgian-Style White Ale with notes of coriander and orange peel. One glass came straight from the bottle, the other glass was poured through Fizzics.

The $130 (£100, AU$175) Fizzics Waytap uses sound waves to shake up the bubbles of your beer. The goal -- make bottled beer taste more like it came from the tap at your favorite bar. It's the same tech as the original $170 (£135, AU$230) Fizzics we tested last year, but the Waytap sports a slimmed down, classier design.

We sipped from both glasses, and the results confirmed my suspicions -- for better and for worse, the Waytap works as well as the original Fizzics, smoothing out the flavor of your beer with the power of science. This process accents sweeter flavors, and mutes the bitter end of the taste spectrum. It makes the beer bubblier and adds a nice head to make it appear like it was poured from the tap, but it's not quite the same thing. Our group was split on the results -- three preferred the White Rascal straight from the bottle (including me), three liked the Fizzics version better.

The Waytap doesn't fix my issues with the original Fizzics, but it's still a good product, and now it looks better and costs less. So if you like experimenting with your beer and especially if you value sweeter flavors -- I'm happy to recommend the reasonably priced $130 Fizzics Waytap. If you're looking for an exact replica of beer on tap, or if you want to stick with the beer as the brewer intended, this isn't the product for you.

Any skepticism around this product is of course justified. Using sound -- not carbon dioxide or any other gases or flavorings -- to improve the taste of bottled beer sounds like a complete load of crap. Check out my review of the original -- after my first Fizzics beer, I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. Fizzics isn't pseudo-science or a simple placebo effect, it really does make a difference.

As it turns out, the science of Fizzics -- the same as in the Waytap -- is fundamentally sound. Brewing laboratories use machines called sonicator baths create a similar effect. Those labs do it to flatten the beer for tests, but the beer's fizz rises dramatically when sonication first starts. I suspect the Waytap does something similar, just in much smaller doses.

Since it doesn't use any gas canisters or kegs, part of the appeal of the Waytap -- like the Fizzics -- is how simple it is to set up and use. You need four AA batteries, your bottle or can of beer, and a glass. That's it.

Pop off the Waytap's lid by pressing the button on the front, put your open can or bottle on the base, then replace the lid -- making sure the metal hose in the center runs into your beer. Grab your glass and pull the handle.

The Waytap gently pours your beer while agitating the carbonation with sound. Fizzics digitally controls the flow while it pours and keeps most of the carbonation intact by keeping the bottle under pressure. When your glass is just about full, push the handle away from you and the Waytap will up the sound intensity and add a frothy head to the top of your glass.

You can clean the Waytap just by running a glass of warm water through the system. The mat and base also separate so you can hand wash them. On average, it took me two to three minutes after I poured one beer before I was ready to pour the next -- and that's when I was using two different beers. If you're pouring multiple bottles of a single beer for guests, there's no need to clean between bottles.

iDevices Switch review: (uw0p8)|"

Editors' note, October 27, 2015: This review has been edited to reflect software updates that added energy tracking and remote access. The score and recommendation have been changed in light of these updates.

The Switch is the newest offering from  iDevices, the company that made the polished and handy  	 iGrill , and it's a solid product. The new gadget, arriving online at the iDevices store and select Lowe's locations this month, does what it's supposed to: turn on  whatever is plugged into it with the swipe of a finger or a quick  voice command using Siri. And now, thanks to some major firmware updates, it compares competitively with other smart plugs and switches  on the market (like the  Belkin WeMo Insight Switch , or if you're up for installation,  the  Insteon On/Off Outlet ). Despite this product's iOS exclusivity and problems with user sharing, the iDevices Switch is one of the best you can find for 60 bucks.

You can set up the iDevices Switch within five  minutes. Included in each package is a Quick Start Guide, a fold-out  that directs setup in four easy steps: download the iDevices app,  connect your iPhone or iPad to your home's Wi-Fi, plug the Switch into a  wall, and launch the app. It really is (almost) that simple. Of course,  the Switch requires a few seconds to sync with your device and gain  Wi-Fi access, but within minutes you can tell Siri to turn on your lamp,  and she will.

I did run into a problem while setting up the Switch at the CNET Smart Home, though. It turns out only the original user of a given HomeKit registered home can install new equipment. That means, if one family member sets up one HomeKit device, they must be the one to set up others in the future. I was able to troubleshoot this issue by creating a new home for the Switch, but that meant I couldn't access any of the HomeKit technology my coworker Ry had already set up. While most HomeKit users won't run into this problem, it is a little odd that HomeKit doesn't allow more customizable permissions for user sharing.

Once your new Switch is plugged in and synced to your  home network most of what it does is up to you. The iDevices app offers  an extremely usable interface, letting you easily swipe between rooms,  see multiple Switches or other iDevices products in each room, and toggle  them individually.

Most comparable apps are tied to a physical hub, like  the  	 SmartThings Hub  or  Insteon Hub , but the iDevices Switch and accompanying app  work through  Apple HomeKit. HomeKit is Apple's iOS-based smart home technology that, among other things, lets you control multiple devices from a single app interface. It requires no central hardware hub to link up those products, but to take advantage of it, each connected device you buy has to be HomeKit-compatible. In theory this is a really cool idea, and the iDevices app certainly benefits from the simpler setup, but certain shortcomings inhibit this Switch.

The first  thing I noticed when I opened the app was the simple but elegant  interface. Although I was only working with three products at once (the Switch, the Thermostat, and iDevices' other plug, the Outdoor Switch), it was  clear that the iDevices app is built for efficiency no matter how many  smart-home devices it's integrating.

To state the obvious, the iDevices Switch is exactly that: a switch. It turns things on and off,  manually via a button on the switch, or through your phone. Now it also tracks energy usage and can be set on a schedule to follow even when you're away from home. These offerings are a little spare; the one-year-old Belkin WeMo Insight Switch, for instance, tracks energy consumption in far more depth, and it also integrates with  	 IFTTT  (""if this then that"") to allow for a far deeper level of  personalization. While the iDevices app lets you control your Switches and set  command combinations on timers, the WeMo lets you program  contingencies, like turning off the lights when you leave the house or  turning on the TV when your favorite team is about to take the field. But overall the iDevices Switch offers as much as the common consumer would want.

With the latest firmware updates, you can now also create schedules that run while you're off the property -- a nice touch for those who are security-conscious.

The iDevices Switch  looks nice. It could be smaller, but it rarely presents  problems with outlets -- blocking an adjacent plug on a four-plug outlet,  or not fitting into an outlet set at a corner or under the lip of a  counter. Anyone experienced with smart plugs and switches knows how bulky they can be, but the iDevices Switch is quite compact.

The aesthetic of the  Switch will fit any home already outfitted with Apple products. It's a  glossy white, soft-cornered switch with a linear nightlight that  you can adjust to any color, saturation or brightness. Although the  light isn't bright enough to light up a dark room, the color  personalization is a great touch, and the ability to turn it off is a  simple function that avoids the annoyance of a  	 perpetual LED .

Although the iDevices Switch is visually appealing, the more functional design  decisions stop it from breaking new  ground in the smart-home industry. In terms of size, the Switch  falls between the Belkin WeMo and the iHome SmartPlug, and with only one  plug outlet, the basic design doesn't offer much that would make it stand out.

The iDevices Switch performs well. The response time between the app and  the Switch is quick, so if you toggle a lamp, it'll turn on in less than a  second. Conversely, if you press the button to manually activate the Switch, the app will accurately reflect the setting. Even when you're off your wireless network, the Switch responds quickly to commands.

The two main performance  problems we saw with the iDevices app was difficulty resetting and reinstalling the Switch elsewhere, and inviting  additional users to the same home network. For most users, moving the Switch between multiple houses really won't be an issue, but if the user-sharing problem isn't solved soon, it will  handcuff the already limited capabilities of the iDevices Switch. iDevices is aware of this issue and is working on solutions now. If they solve the problem, the Switch will perform almost flawlessly.

Smart switches are easy way for anyone trying to raise their home's IQ, but the accompanying integration network is as important as the physical technology if you want anything beyond the most basic controls. With HomeKit still maturing, it means you need to have some faith in the Apple ecosystem, and be willing to put up with some bugs, while you wait for that faith to pay off.

The   iDevices app pulls together products in one of the most attractive and   efficient interfaces I've seen, and now the iDevices Switch seems like it would fit right in at a smart home. At $60, (which converts roughly to £40 and AU$85), a user-friendly app and a relatively versatile Switch are the best you can expect.

If you're just looking for an indoor smart switch, the iDevices offering is one of the best out there -- especially for more casual consumers. For HomeKit early adopters, iDevices' product will be a foundational part of your Smart Home's development."
