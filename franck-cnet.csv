                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/1-ring-moon/preview/|This creepy floating eyeball might be the smart home cam you want|"

If you think smart home tech is creepy, the Moon will be a great device to prove your point. It's a floating eyeball-shaped security cam that can rotate to follow your movements. If you think smart home tech is exciting and inventive, well, the Moon might help you prove that point as well.

According to its description, the Moon is a levitating smart home camera that doubles as a smart home hub from Delaware-based startup 1-Ring. Because the base charges the cam wirelessly while it floats, it can supposedly levitate in perpetuity. From the app, you can rotate the cam to look around the room. It also has motion sensing and microphones on either side of the lens, so it knows what direction a sound is coming from, and can turn silently (since it floats) to track the noise.

The company's Indiegogo campaign (currently more than 200 percent funded) says you can customize what the camera does when it senses something -- you can receive a notification, record a video clip or snap a photo. The Moon stores footage locally on a microSD card or uploads it to your cloud drive of choice -- whether that's your personal Dropbox account, Google Drive or your own FTP server.

While the Moon sounds cool as a security camera -- yes, the floating aspect is neat, and I particularly like that you can save footage on your cloud service of choice -- it checks a lot of other boxes as a multipurpose smart tool. It'll work as a hub with built-in Wi-Fi (as you'd expect) as well as Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth, NFC and even an IR blaster.

The Moon will launch with a few impressive smart home partners, including Philips Hue, SmartThings and Honeywell. In theory, you'll be able to connect smaller smart home gadgets such as your light bulbs and switches to the Moon, and then control them with the Moon app.

1-Ring hasn't specified which SmartThings and Philips Hue devices its product works with, or what types of devices it's compatible with. Hopefully, you'll be able to use the Moon in place of a SmartThings or Philips hub, and we've reached out to 1-Ring to confirm these details.

The Moon will also work with all three major voice assistants -- Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Plus, the IR blaster will supposedly let the Moon control your TV and speakers as well.

1-Ring says it also put temp, humidity and carbon dioxide sensors in the Moon, and you can customize notifications based on those readings. It has a built-in speaker, so you can use it for video calls. Plus, the microphones built into the cam will supposedly recognize the difference between talking, crying and glass breaking. The cam's specs also look impressive:

Assuming the Moon comes to fruition, it has a nice combination of features to keep up with our favorite smart home cams. You can preorder the floating cam now via the company's Indiegogo campaign. There's a discount for preordering, and 1-Ring says it will ship the cam anywhere in the world.

                HOPii
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/hopii/preview/|Your personal brewmaster, the HOPii, makes and pours you a cold one|"

A new automatic beer brewer called the HOPii wants to claim the middle ground between beer brewing machines like the PicoBrew and a simple at-home tap such as the Fizzics. And home brewers seem ready for the HOPii's easy approach to brewing: The product has raised more than $371,000 from 362 backers on Kickstarter, leaping over its initial crowdfunding goal of $50,000.

With the push of a button, the HOPii whips up a batch of fresh brew with a process that thankfully doesn't involve anything gross, like making beer from concentrate. The HOPii's creators take care of the first two steps of beer brewing (the mash and the boil), which creates unfermented beer called wort. The company will send you an ingredient pack with a big bottle of wort, a packet of yeast and any extras you need to finish the recipe. Then, you put everything in place and hit start, and the HOPii takes care of the rest. You'll even be able pour the beer from the HOPii's built-in tap when the beer is finished.

The HOPii allows you to drink freshly made beer while getting around the strict guidelines for shipping alcoholic liquid from state to state (the fermentation step is what makes wort alcoholic). In theory, this would let you try beers from brewers that don't distribute to your area. However, the HOPii will begin with an offering of only 12 recipes -- all made by the HOPii team. Company reps say they're working on adding partnerships with other breweries.

The HOPii unit is temperature-controlled and recognizes the type of beer you're brewing from the bottle of wort. Supposedly, it creates the ideal fermentation conditions for that type of beer, and it can clean and sanitize itself when you're done brewing.

My main concern with the HOPii's approach is that it goes against the common brewing practice of introducing your yeast to your wort as soon as possible. The sugars in wort are purposely primed to react with yeast, so wort can easily get infected if something in the air starts reacting with those sugars first. With the HOPii, the volatile wort is shipped and could be in the container for weeks before you put it into the machine and start fermenting.

A rep from HOPii reassured me that they've worked with multiple third-party labs on quality control. The wort containers are airtight and block out light as well, and they have a shelf life of up to a month.

You can preorder the HOPii on Kickstarter now for a discount. The first machines are scheduled to ship worldwide in the summer of 2018. Once the final product is ready, the HOPii will be available on Amazon and will ship in time for the 2018 holidays. The retail price will be a hefty $600, which converts to approximately £450 and AU$750. Ingredient packs will be $20 to $30 a piece (£15/£20 and AU$25/AU$40) and will produce 3 liters of beer. That measures out to about eight glasses of beer per batch, so roughly $3 for each 12-ounce glass you drink.

That's a lot to spend on a beer gadget, but it's not as much as the $800 PicoBrew Pico. Still, I'd hope the HOPii will offer a greater variety of brews by the time the product is finished.

Certain Kickstarter backers can also use the HOPii to ferment their homebrew recipes in precisely controlled conditions. That'd be a great extra if HOPii rolled it out to the final product, but for now, the company is only offering it on preordered machines."

                Samsung RF265BEAESR French Door Family Hub Refrigerator
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/samsung-rf265beaesr-french-door-family-hub-refrigerator/review/|Samsung RF265BEAESR French Door Family Hub Refrigerator review:|"

Samsung swung for the smart fridge fences with the Family Hub, an out-and-proud connected refrigerator with ingredient-tracking cameras and a whopping 21.5-inch touchscreen on the door. I liked that fridge a lot more than I thought I would, but with retail prices starting at more than $5,000, it was much too expensive for most folks to justify a purchase.

Enter Family Hub 2.0, which sees Samsung expanding the fleet in year two to include new models that are less fancy -- and less expensive -- than before. The cheapest of the bunch is the RF265BEAESR, a basic French door model in plain stainless steel. Originally priced at $3,299, the model has enjoyed regular discounts since its debut. As of writing this, Samsung has it listed on sale for $2,299, which is downright reasonable for a dumb French door fridge, let alone a smart one.

The trade-off is that you no longer get a luxurious, four-door build or a ""Flex Zone"" capable of switching between fridge and freezer settings depending on what you want to put in it, but those are acceptable sacrifices for people who just want those touchscreen smarts at the lowest price possible. The good news: those smarts are just as smart as before -- which is to say that they aren't perfect, but they're a little better than you might expect. And, with Samsung's Bixby voice assistant set to arrive in Family Hub fridges via software update at some point in the future, those smarts stand to improve with time.

The cheaper Family Hub isn't the stunner that its predecessor was, and it isn't a must-have by any stretch, but it's still a decent refrigerator with compelling features you won't find anywhere else. If it fills you with skepticism, then feel free to skip it, but if that touchscreen inspires fridge envy, it's never been more affordable. I say anything under $2,500 is a pretty fair price for it.

In the case of the new, cheaper Family Hub, the answer is everything that last year's more expensive Family Hub can do. Some of the highlights include:

The better question might be what can't the Family Hub do yet. The big omission is Bixby voice controls, which Samsung has long been promising. They'll arrive sooner or later, and when they do, there's a chance that they make the Family Hub a lot easier to use, but for now, they get an ""incomplete"" grade.

One problem is that we're starting to see voice-activated touchscreen gadgets like the Amazon Echo Show make their way into people's homes, which raises the bar for a dedicated display like the Family Hub's. Eventually, I suspect that it'll basically serve as a king-sized, Bixby-powered Echo Show for your kitchen, but we aren't there yet, and I wouldn't fault anybody who wanted to wait until we were before buying in.

That said, there are still some nice year-two refinements to the user interface. You'll find a few more apps, for instance, including a Nomiku app that can control smart sous vide gadgets. Samsung's existing apps are better-designed, too, with things like cartoonish avatars for each family member. They're also better-integrated with each other. For instance, after picking out something to cook from the Allrecipes app, you can select specific ingredients to add to your shopping list, or set timers specific to a particular part of the recipe.

Like the original Family Hub, you can open the camera feed and drag expiration timers over top of specific things in the fridge, but they won't live over top of that feed like before. Instead, they're relegated to a separate list. I'm not a fan of that change, as it puts those expiration reminders out of sight and out of mind, where they're less helpful.

There's also still no app for the Samsung-owned SmartThings connected home platform. The ability to toggle lights on and off or lock your door by tapping on the fridge might offer questionable utility at best, but it's still strange that Samsung hasn't done a better job of integrating its ecosystem by now.

Unlike last year's glamorous four-door models, the cheapest Family Hub fridge comes in a simple French door build with about 24 cubic feet of total storage space. It's still a few steps above entry level as far as French doors are concerned -- you get an in-door ice and water dispenser, as well as a temperature-adjustable ""Cool Select Pantry"" drawer and shelves that slide in and fold up to make room for tall items below. You can also get it in black stainless steel for an additional $100.

None of that is unique to this fridge (far from it), but it does make for a model that, on its own, would typically retail for somewhere between $1,600 and $2,000. That's before you factor in the touchscreen, the camera and the fridge apps. In other words, Samsung hit a strange sweet spot here -- cheap enough to bring the Family Hub's price way down, but still nice enough to call it a legitimate upgrade for most folks. In this case, the boring design is a feature, not a bug.

Still, it's fair to be disappointed if you were holding out for a design that's more refined. There's still the ""Ice Master"" ice maker eating up space on the top shelf -- and yes, there's still a much-too-narrow shelf in the door that we've affectionately dubbed the ""salsa moat."" In fairness to Samsung, both seem slightly less egregious than they were -- the Ice Master is a tad skinnier, while the salsa moat offers slightly more depth than before. They're both still design imperfections, but more annoyances than deal-breakers.

16.2 of the refrigerator's 24.2 cubic feet of total storage space are allocated to the fridge, which puts it on the small side of the French door spectrum. It's not a compact model by any stretch, but it might not be the best choice for a family of more than four or five.

The new Family Hub isn't as fancy as before, but it still offers decent performance for a fridge at this price range. During a week or so of non-stop performance tests in our appliances lab, it held accurate temperatures throughout the body of the fridge at both the default 37-degree setting and the coldest setting of 34 degrees.

It wasn't perfect, though. The bottom of the left door and the top of the right door both ran just slightly on the warm side, averaging temperatures above 40 degrees F at the default setting. That's pretty typical for a mid-range fridge like this, and not a real concern at all given that door shelves typically hold things like butter, beverages and preservative-heavy condiments. The temperatures in the body of the fridge are what really count.

The Cool Select Pantry drawer was more of a disappointment. It claims to offer three distinct temperature settings: 34, 38 and 41 degrees. The actual temperature range is much tighter, ranging from 34 to 37 degrees, and it also seemed susceptible to temperature changes in the body of the fridge surrounding it.

That's par for the course with temperature-adjustable drawers that live inside of the fridge itself, where it's quite a challenge to maintain a separate temperature. It's still useful if you want to soften up some cheese or get some soda a degree or two colder, but if precision is what you're after, you'll be better off looking for a model with a drawer that lives outside of the fridge itself.

The RF265BEAESR is designed to bring the Family Hub's touchscreen and grocery cameras into your kitchen at a much lower expense than before, and if you can catch it on sale, that's exactly what it offers. At $2,500 or less, you'll be spending a little less than you would on GE's coffee-making smart fridge and a lot less than you'll need to spend on the LG Smart InstaView fridge. You won't get last year's premium design, but you will get all of the same apps and smart features as before. Plus, the fridge is still a pretty decent performer, and nice enough to feel like you aren't compromising too much.

Samsung hasn't made the Family Hub a must-have yet, though. That might change as new software updates arrive, but for now, the touchscreen smarts amount to little more than a fun, semi-frivolous extra. If you're tempted, here's my advice: track one down at a department store and play around with the screen a bit. If it's still the sort of frivolous extra that strikes your fancy, then feel free to give it a shot. Worst case scenario: you'll pay a reasonable amount for a perfectly decent fridge with a touchscreen you won't use all that much."

LG wants to take the aches and pains out of lawn care by letting you control its latest smart mower with your voice. The manufacturer's LG Lawn Mower Robot will work with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, the virtual assistants that you can cue with your voice. That means you should be able to say, ""Alexa, cut my grass"" or ""OK, Google, mow the lawn"" to your Alexa- or Google Assistant-enabled smart speaker when the grass is too long, and the Lawn Mower Robot will automatically do its thing.

LG showed off the Lawn Mower Robot Thursday at the IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin. The company first announced the mower at the CES 2017 consumer electronics show, but it made more details available this week:

But there's still a lot we don't know about the Lawn Mower Robot. LG didn't release information about when it will be available, in which countries you can buy it or how much the mower will cost. It's sure to be expensive -- robot lawnmowers tend to start at about $1,000 (about £775 or AU$1,260) and increase from there depending on how large your yard is.

Whenever the Lawn Mower Robot becomes available, it does seem to have some advantages over similar gadgets, such as the $1,600 Robomow RS612 we reviewed last year. Integration with virtual assistants is cool, and the built-in GPS adds some security to robot lawnmowers since you're supposed to leave them outside rather than locked away.

Along with integration with Amazon and Google, LG equipped the boxy mower with GPS tracking that collects data about where it needs to go in your yard.

                Weber Genesis II E-310
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/weber-genesis-ii-e-310/review/|Weber Genesis II E-310 review:|"

Weber's reputation for building durable, practical outdoor grills goes back decades. Now the company wants you to think smart, too, when you think Weber. To that end, the $850 Weber Genesis II E-310 has lots of what you expect from a Weber BBQ, plus a side of app connectivity.

To enable the smarts on this already expensive propane cooker you'll need to shell out an extra $100 for Weber's iGrill 3 accessory. It's actually a fairly useful add-on, but it's not included in the core product. Due to three powerful burners and sensitive heat controls, mastering your grilling technique on this hot-rod cooker also takes practice.

All this makes the Genesis II suited to more experienced grill enthusiasts with the patience to master this high-end unit. If smarts in a more forgiving high-end grill is what you want, the $800 Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared is slightly cheaper and easier to use.

I appreciate how sturdy and solid the Genesis II feels. Its lid and pair of side tables are built from heavy steel. Both the grill's cast iron grates and lid are enameled in porcelain too. My only complaint, a minor one, is Weber's choice to use some plastic in the E-310's construction. The ends of the grill's side tables are wrapped in gray plastic bumpers that cheapens its appearance. The same goes for the plastic trim on the lid. Still, the lid does have a large built-in thermometer, a Weber standard feature the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared lacks.

The Genesis II relies on what Weber calls the ""GS4 High Performance Grilling System,"" which involves three propane burners each rated at a robust 37,500 BTU. That's plenty of heating power to have at your disposal. The Char-Broil SmartChef, by comparison, has three gas burners as well, but they provide less oomph at just 25,000 BTU apiece. You do get a small side burner with Char-Broil's SmartChef grill, a feature Weber includes on various grills across its product lines, but not on this one.

Both grills differ in the way they cook your food. The Genesis II uses wedge-shaped bars to cover and protect its burners from grease and drippings. The bars also act as deflectors to spread heat evenly across the grilling surface above as well. All three burners are lit by the same ignition module and its corresponding igniter button. You have to supply it with AA disposable batteries, as you do with most other propane grills. Each of the burners have their own weather-resistant electrodes, however, to improve reliability. Weber refers to the design as ""Infinity Ignition.""

The SmartChef protects its burners with similar protective bars, though it calls them ""heat tents."" Char-Broil also introduces a second part in the mix, a thin steel plate just below its grates and above the burners. A component in Char-Broil's ""Tru-Infrared"" grilling system, the plate is designed to absorb the heat from the burners, and use it to mimic the radiant heat you get from charcoal. The different cooking methods likely explain the results of my cooking tests, too. I'll get to that soon.

One huge advantage of Weber's Genesis II grill design is it's a snap to clean. It has large parts, and only a few of them. They're also spaced out well so pulling the machine apart for maintenance is easy. Weber also built an elegant grease management system at the heart of the cooker. Any juices and drippings that make it past the burners are funneled towards a waiting disposable drip tray for collection.

The Weber Genesis II E-310 is among just a few backyard grills that support smart technology. Weber didn't create this tech on its own -- it acquired the iGrill brand from iDevices, a line of Bluetooth, app-connected thermometers, including the $50 iGrill Mini.

The latest product to join the iGrill line postacquisition is the $100 iGrill 3, and it works as an add-on to Weber's Genesis II and Genesis II LX grills that fits into a physical socket on the front of those units. Weber pushes the iGrill 3 as an upgrade meant for its Genesis II grills alone but aside from the tailored receptacle, it will work fine with any brand of grill, it just won't have a dedicated slot to mount it securely.

All of the various iGrill models link to the Weber mobile app, which lets you monitor the Genesis II wirelessly from a distance of 30 feet. The scope of the app is narrow compared to Char-Broil's SmartChef application. SmartChef tackles lots of things besides food. It tracks propane levels, burner status and even tells you if the grill is cool enough to cover. Weber's app just sticks to measuring temperatures of meat, fish and poultry as you cook.

Regardless I prefer Weber's targeted approach and the iGrill software overall. The app is intuitive, cleanly organized and uncluttered. Barbecue enthusiasts will enjoy the handy graph that extrapolates when your meal will be done based on current conditions. My favorite feature is how the software pings you when you're 10 degrees out from your probe's target temp. It then pings you each time the thermometer rises by 1 degree until your food is done.

The application's connection to its probes was continuous and always ready to display temperatures in real time. By contrast the Char-Broil SmartChef app usually lost temperature probe data if I closed it or simply opened another application on my phone (a Google Pixel XL). Another advantage the iGrill app has over SmartChef is a simple wizard to setup probes to actively monitor your food while it cooks. For example, you can select the food type (chicken, burgers, steak and so on) and iGrill knows what target temperature you need to hit. You can also choose the level of doneness you'd like and the app adapts accordingly.

This is a big catch though. To add smarts to the Genesis II you'll need to purchase the iGrill 3 accessory separately, a $100 upgrade. All of the Char-Broil SmartChef grill's technology comes built-in. Still, especially if you're a new to grilling or you simply like to cook with precision, the iGrill 3 is a worthwhile addition to this or any other grill, since it makes cooking tricky items such as poultry and big cuts of steak safer and easier.

Grilling on the Weber Genesis II takes practice. I learned that while its burners are mighty, they also offer a wide temperature range which can be unforgiving if you're not careful. For example, when I turned the Genesis II's burner dials all the way up, after 10 minutes the temperature under the hood easily cracked 600 degrees (633.7 in fact). That same high setting and preheat time on the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared yielded an internal temp of 457.4 degrees. Likewise, medium power on the Genesis, especially cooking with indirect heat, was much cooler than I expected. This resulted in unacceptably long cooking times even when all its burner knob markings were parked dead center of its dial.

To measure how grills perform under high heat conditions, I subjected them to our burger test. This exercise shows how much raw power a grill can bring to the table. I ran three such tests of six 5.3-ounce burgers each pressed from the same hamburger press. I flipped all of the burners on high and gave the grill 10 minutes to preheat.

After that I arranged the patties on the grill in a rectangular pattern (two patties high, three across) with 1.5 to 2 inches spacing between them. I inserted one of the iGrill probes into the center, front patty. I closed the hood, and gave the burgers a flip after 6 minutes. With the lid closed again, I recorded how long it took the internal burger temp to hit 145 degrees. The Genesis II took 10 minutes and 10 seconds for its burgers to finish, just 5 seconds faster than the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared.

The Genesis II produced patties with a decent crust but considerable char too. Searing for too long or at too high heat levels gives food burnt charcoal flavors I'd rather do without. Unfortunately the insides of these burgers were also on the dry side. By contrast I found the burgers from the Char-Broil grill juicier, and with more flavor.

The Genesis II turned in mixed results on our beer can chicken test, designed to assess how well a grill operates at medium heat. I again used one of the grill's probes to tell me when the internal temperature reached 165 degrees. I also set the left and right burners to the midway mark as indicated by on their dials. Since indirect heat is the goal here, I left the center burner off.

Usually a 5 to 6 pound bird takes anywhere from 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours to finish cooking. Unfortunately the Genesis failed this first attempt, requiring almost 4 hours for its probe to hit the magic number. The temperature inside the grill box hovered at around 250 degrees with the left and right burner dials at the medium setting. It also took a long 55 minutes to reach this temp. After seeing the test through to the end (when the probes hit the temp), the chicken was inedible. Its skin was as leathery as a football and the flesh inside was watery, mushy and thoroughly unappetizing.

For the second test, I bumped up the dials a tiny fraction above their midpoint, and the temperature inside the grill rocketed up to 460 degrees in 30 minutes where it stayed. The bird hit 165 in a quick 1 hour 14 minutes. Its skin was nicely roasted and crisp too. The dark meat was especially tender and moist. White meat from the breast was slightly dry, however, and overcooked.

I used a rack of pork ribs for our low temperature test. For this test I started all three of the grill's burners and left them running full blast for 10 minutes (lid closed). In the meantime, I seasoned one rack of St. Louis-style pork spareribs (3.6 pounds) with ordinary dry rub mix sourced from the local supermarket.

I draped the ribs across the Genesis II's metal warming tray that sits above the grill grates. Finally I dialed all three burner knobs down to their lowest setting and closed the lid. I cooked two racks this way; the first I ran for 3 hours, the second for 3 hours 30 minutes. On both the CharBroil SmartChef and Weber Genesis II, the ribs were too thin to shield their probes from ambient hot air under the lid. As a result I fell back to cooking by time instead of hitting a target thermometer reading. Both grills turned in slightly underdone ribs after a 3-hour cook, so I bumped the time up another 30 minutes for round two.

Similar to how this Weber grill treated burgers, the Genesis II pumped out more heat than was necessary. On both the 3 hour and the 3 hour 30 minute runs, the ribs were good but too crisp and dry for my taste. The solution lies with some different combination of cooking time and temperature, but within the confines of the time allotted for this review, I had to stop there. The takeaway is that you can expect some trial and error before you find the path to delicious ribs from this Weber.

In contrast, the Char-Broil SmartChef over the same time period came out much better. Same prepackaged ribs from Costco, same dry rub seasoning. Especially at the longer cook time, the CharBroil ribs were dripping with moisture and succulent. Yum.

Weber is one of the most popular grill brands in the US. That's why I'm surprised by the unpredictable behavior the $850 Weber Genesis II E-310 demonstrated on our tests. This isn't to say this is a bad product, it's simply that you'll likely need to learn its quirks before you achieve the best grilling results.

For that reason, splurging on the Genesis II's $100 iGrill 3 smart accessory could make sense. It will certainly take the guesswork out of learning its temperature settings. Still, $950 all-in is a heck of a lot of cash to spend on a grill, especially for the more casual outdoor cook."

                Mistbox
                                    2017
"|https://www.cnet.com/products/mistbox-2017/preview/|Mistbox mini sprinkler system cools down your tired AC unit|"

The summer months are tough on air conditioners. Not only is your thermostat's set temperature likely lower because of the blistering heat, your outside AC unit has to use more energy to cool that warmer-than-average ambient air to that lower-than-average indoor temperature. As a result, you end up paying significantly more on your electric bill.

Mistbox wants to make the warmest months of the year a bit more bearable with version 2.0 of its energy-saving smart device. Mistbox 2.0 is designed to reduce the air temperature around your AC unit by gently spraying water whenever its built-in sensors and the weather forecast tell it to.

Available for preorder now on Kickstarter, the second-gen Mistbox offers some key upgrades over its predecessor. It still connects to your outside AC unit, and you'll find similar sprinkler attachments that mist water from your garden hose, but the Mistbox 2.0 now operates via wind power rather than solar energy.

Specifically, it comes with a small wind turbine attachment that relies on exhaust air from the unit's condenser fan for power. This is a smart update because you can depend on the fan's exhaust rather than worrying whether your Mistbox is getting enough sunlight. (Outside AC units consist of a compressor, a condenser and a secondary fan.)

The new Mistbox also uses cellular data instead of Wi-Fi. Partly because of this, Mistbox has changed its payment system to a subscription service. I'm not a fan of monthly subscription fees, but a cellular network makes sense in this case. I installed and began testing the original Mistbox unit at my house more than a year ago, only to run into a series of errors during the Wi-Fi configuration stage. I'm guessing my router just wasn't close enough to the spot where my outside AC unit is located.

Mistbox says it's done more to treat the water that's sprayed around your AC unit with the second version of the gadget. Apparently, untreated water can damage your cooling system with harmful bacteria and other allergens.

In addition to these major changes, Mistbox 2.0's design looks a lot better at a glance. That might not matter much, since it's going to be installed outside on your AC unit, but it could also translate to improved ease of use. We'll just have to see for ourselves.

Mistbox has raised over $180,000 so far on Kickstarter; its original funding goal was just $10,000. Units are expected to ship internationally in August starting at $89 for a prepaid year-long subscription (that converts to about £70 or AU$115) -- or for $399 to purchase it outright (plus a $49 subscription fee; $349 converts to £270 or AU$455).

After the crowdfunding campaign ends, Mistbox devices will be available for purchase starting at $10 per month. Non-Kickstarter customers can also opt for a $99 prepaid annual subscription. A $39 activation fee will apply to all purchases as well, unless you preorder via Kickstarter."

                Loop Labs Notion
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/loop-labs-notion/review/|Notion review:|"

Notion tries to squeeze all the smarts you need to watch over your home into a small white puck. For $220, you get three of those pucks and a bridge that plugs into your wall and connects those sensors to the cloud. You can ask a puck to tell you if your front door is open or closed. You can stick one in the laundry room to watch for leaks or on the ceiling where it will listen for your smoke detector.

Instead of buying a bunch of different specialized sensors to do these same tasks, the Notion sensors adapt to your needs by multitasking. I love the idea of decluttering the smart home, but in practice, Notion doesn't offer any practical advantage over more specialized sensors like the $40 SmartThings Multipurpose Sensor or the $50 Roost Leak Detector. The app limits what senses you can turn on together, and some of the combinations you can enable don't make sense.

At the moment, Notion doesn't work with any other smart home systems either, so if it does detect something wrong, Notion can't do anything other than send you a push notification. Because of that, Notion isn't as good at any individual task as the best specialized devices out there. I'd wait for future updates before investing in Notion, or if you know what you want to monitor, you can take your pick from a crowded field of specialized sensors.

I tested the $220 three pack of Notion sensors with a bridge. The $300 package might be the best deal -- you get five sensors with a bridge. Individually, you can buy an additional bridge for $80 and an additional sensor for $50. Head to the company's site to make a purchase. Notion's only available in the US and Canada.

The site also talks about the eight senses of Notion -- temperature, acceleration, natural frequency, light, motion, sound, angular rate and water. In the future, Notion could use all of these senses to their full potential and sense the light levels in your home. It could tell you when your propane tank is almost empty. It could even listen for the doorbell.

Right now, those eight senses boil down to four basic options. You can use Notion to monitor when a door opens and closes (including a garage door), Notion will sense temperature, it'll watch for leaks, and it'll listen for smoke or CO alarms.

Setup's pleasingly simple. You need at least one sensor and the bridge to get started. Plug the bridge into any outlet, and you'll see the light at the top start flashing. Create an account via the app, then you'll scan the QR code on the back of each sensor to add them to your account. Each bridge can accommodate up to 15 sensors.

If you have a big house, you might need more than one bridge so all of your sensors are in range -- the bridge had trouble picking up a sensor when I moved it down one floor and over a couple of rooms. Thankfully, you can position the bridge so it doesn't block the adjacent outlet. Get the bridge and the sensors synced, and you can start placing the latter where you need monitoring via the sticky adhesive on the back.

I used my first sensor to monitor the door of the CNET Smart Home. The app asks you to place the sensor above the knob at the top of the door. I wanted this first sensor to multitask as much as it could, so I used the app to try to enable Notion's other senses.

The app stopped me from using it to listen to smoke alarms -- you can't enable that feature on a sensor monitoring a door. You can turn on temperature readings, as well as leak detection. Given the placement of the sensor at the top of the door, that first sensor would have issues detecting leaks. By the time the water level got that high, I'd hope I'd already have noticed a problem.

Both the $100 Kidde RemoteLync Monitor and the $100 Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight listen for smoke and CO Alarms, and both can listen for alarms anywhere on the floor of a home. A door sensor that also provided this functionality would have been unique and useful. That combination would have made a lot more sense to me than combining leak detection with a door monitor.

I setup my second sensor as a listener, and the app asked me to place the sensor on the ceiling near my detector. Again, I could enable leak detection for some reason, as well as temperature readings.

I suppose the leak detection could catch a drip in your ceiling when it rains, but you'd have to place it in the exact right spot, so you'd already know there was a problem. I used my third sensor as an actual leak detector, and set it up in the laundry room of the smart home, with temperature readings turned on for that sensor as well.

Notion can multitask in theory. In practice, you can combine a temperature sensor with any of the other functions, but can't realistically combine anything else.

At each individual task, Notion performs admirably. I always received a notification within a few seconds of the front door opening. You can also turn notifications off when you're at home, away, or at night. You can manually tell Notion when you leave, or let it use your phone for geofencing.

In the app, you can tap on your door icon to see a simple log of when the door opened and closed. The leak and sound sensors record a similar log. The temperature sensor actually charts its measurements over the course of the past day, week, and month. You can customize notifications with each enabled sense. So with the temperature sensor, you can put it in your wine cellar, pick an ideal temperature threshold, and have Notion let you know if it ever gets hotter or cooler.

The app lets you add and remove functions from each sensor as you please. Even after the initial setup, you're limited in what senses you can use together, but Notion's main advantage over the competition comes if you change your mind about what you want to monitor. You could fairly easily repurpose a door sensor into a flood sensor in the furnace room if you think there might be a problem.

As a flood sensor, Notion picked up water pretty quickly, and the sensor is somewhat water resistant. Notion has two probes on one side of the sensor. When water connects them, it completes a circuit and Notion sends you a push notification. The tech is similar to the other flood sensors we've tested, though some have an option to sound an alarm or interact with your larger smart home to flash the lights.

I also fooled the Notion's flood sensor when I used my finger instead of water to complete the circuit. Plus, Notion's pretty small, so you'll want to be strategic with where you place it if you want it to detect a problem early.

When I sounded the smoke alarm, Notion responded quickly with a push notification if it was in the same room. Notion's hearing ability did prove more spotty when I moved the sensor a room away. It's understandable that Notion can't hear as far as the Kidde or Leeo monitors -- both of those plug directly into a wall. Notion needs to conserve power since it's running on a battery. Still, because of this limitation, it's less useful as a safety device as it can realistically only listen for one alarm.

I also ran into a strange glitch while testing Notion's listening functionality. The coin cell battery in each Notion sensor is supposed to last a year or two. Mine died within a couple of weeks. According to a company representative, it woke up to listen too frequently, but the problem only affects a small percentage of customers.

I haven't been able to replicate the problem on a second sensor yet -- I repurposed the laundry room sensor as a listening device. I did run into another glitch with that sensor, as it looked to have lost all temperature data for a morning, but the charts eventually repopulated after a couple of hours.

The same company representative hinted that the next generation of Notion sensors will be arriving shortly -- hopefully by the end of this calendar year. Glitches aside, Notion functions well enough, but if you're interested in the system, it's worth waiting for the second generation of the product to see if it polishes the edges of the experience and handles multitasking better.

Yes, Notion's $50 sensors are multipurpose, but because of where you need to place them, you'll likely only use them for one task at a time. You can turn on leak sensing in your door monitor, but the app asks you to place it in the top corner of your door. If the water level rises that high, I'm pretty sure you'd know something was wrong already.

Getting started with a $220 three-pack of sensors and a bridge isn't a bad deal, but it's a little expensive. Notion does well enough at each individual task you ask it to do, but it fails to separate itself from the multitude of capable smart home sensors you can find with any of the major platforms such as SmartThings, Wink, and Insteon. If you want connected monitoring, I'd pick what you want to monitor and start with a single purpose sensor. Hopefully, the second generation of Notion sensors will follow through on the promise shown by the first gen, but I wouldn't recommend spending $220 on potential."

                Tend Secure Lynx Indoor Camera
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/tend-secure-lynx-indoor-camera/review/|Tend Secure Lynx review:|"

Today's home security market follows a pretty predictable pattern. Most DIY security cameras come with high-definition live streaming video, cloud storage for that video, some kind of motion detection feature and typically cost about $200. Tend Secure's Lynx Indoor camera has all of those things, but it costs just $60 (£45/AU$80).

Yep, you read that right -- 1080p HD resolution, 7-day free event-based cloud storage and advanced, facial recognition-based motion alerts all for 60 bucks.

The Lynx doesn't currently integrate with any major smart home platforms, although it is slated to work with the Google Assistant by the end of July. Its removable base is oddly designed, too, and doesn't hold the camera in place well. It isn't a perfect camera, but its features and overall value make it easy to recommend.

While it's great to see a budget HD DIY camera on the market, Tend Secure should've thrown a little more money at the Lynx's design.

The base that's supposed to hold the camera upright on a table or other flat surface doesn't quite get the job done. As you can see in the image to the right, you simply slide the camera into the base without a latch closure or other locking mechanism to keep it from moving around.

You could tape it down or skip a tabletop installation altogether (wall-mounting hardware comes with your purchase), but it isn't ideal.

The camera looks fine otherwise, if not a little utilitarian. Its small size does help it blend into surroundings more easily.

We've reviewed three DIY cameras that ID specific faces: The ArcSoft Simplicam, the Netatmo Welcome -- and Tend Secure's Lynx. Every other camera touting advanced motion detection can only tell you when it sees a person, any person, without being able to recognize specific faces.

The Simplicam is no longer widely available for purchase, but originally retailed for $150 (about £115/AU$200 converted); Netatmo's Welcome is still sold, but costs $199 (£150/AU$265). While Simplicam charged an optional monthly fee for extra features like cloud storage, the Welcome relies on local storage in the form of a microSD card. If you have a strong preference for local storage and want facial recognition, the Welcome is a reasonable choice.

But if you don't mind using the Lynx's free 7-day event-based cloud storage instead (specifically, it will save 7 days of downloadable motion-related video clips on a rolling basis), you get all of the same things, including arguably better facial-recognition performance.

Here's how the Lynx's facial-recognition software works:

While the Lynx never got a face wrong during my testing, we did have to walk pretty close to the camera and stare at it for at least a couple of seconds before it detected anyone's face. If I walked quickly by the camera feed, it would only deliver the generic motion alert and not detect me. Over time, though, it got a little better, and started to recognize me even when I barely stopped in front of the camera. The more images of you it logs at various (and often unflattering) angles, the better it gets at detecting your face.

Setting everything up in the app was pretty simple. Download the Tend Secure app for Android or iPhone and follow the instructions on the screen. You need to be connected to your local Wi-Fi network, but it only takes a few minutes to get the Lynx's live stream working.

One source of potential annoyance: If you move the camera to a new location with a new Wi-Fi network, you'll have to start the configuration process all over again. I began testing the Lynx at our CNET Appliances office and finished testing at the CNET Smart Home across town. Fortunately, reconfiguring the camera didn't take long;  it also miraculously saved my original facial recognition library. My favorite cameras make it easier, though, by simply letting you update the Wi-Fi details in the app without having to reset everything.

The $60 Tend Secure Lynx Indoor camera is truly unique. It's inexpensive, but manages to offer a lot of the same features as $200 security cameras. The free cloud storage is also a huge bonus, as there's no need to worry about monthly fees to access advanced features like watching saved clips or review facial recognition alerts.

If you can work around the Lynx's odd design, you're left with a solid live streaming camera that gets smarter over time."

                Hestan Cue
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/hestan-cue/review/|Hestan Cue review:|"

The appeal of many smart kitchen gadgets is that they're supposed to automatically take care of the hard parts of cooking. Connected kitchen scales from the Perfect Company use weight to determine how much of an ingredient you need to add to your cocktail, smoothie or baked good. A new line of Vitamix blenders will automatically know which settings to use based on the container you use. And the June Intelligent Oven uses a camera to identify your food and cook it accordingly.

The $650 Hestan Cue cooking system has the same appeal, but with a bonus. This countertop ($131.39 at Amazon.com) induction burner, stainless-steel pan and app work together -- thanks to Bluetooth -- to teach you how to be a better cook while it automatically regulates your cooking temperature.

The education component of the Hestan Cue is the star of the product. Videos are included with each step of a recipe, so you can see exactly what you're supposed to do. And there are many delicious dishes from which to choose, whether it's sauces or salmon or pancakes.

It's not as impressive without its app. For example, the Hestan Cue regulates the surface temperature of the pan well, but steaks with uneven thickness gave it problems that resulted in uneven cooking. And like I've seen with other cooking systems, there's no easy way to adapt recipes. You're stuck with the ingredients and steps Hestan gives you. Fortunately, the recipes I tried were very good, but it would be nice to build my own recipes or replace ingredients in existing ones.

The Hestan Cue, which is available online and at Williams Sonoma, would be a great addition to the kitchen of a home cook with ""Top Chef"" aspirations. It will keep you from burning an important dish and teach you a thing or two in the process. But $650 is a lot of money for two pieces of hardware. If you need some help in the kitchen but don't have the cash, buy a decent pan and a food thermometer and watch some old episodes of ""Good Eats.""



The Hestan Cue is like a combination of the Pantelligent smart frying pan and the FirstBuild Paragon Induction Cooktop ($199.00 at Amazon.com). Didn't read those reviews? Let me break it down for you: The pan contains a ""smart capsule"" in its handle that is equipped with Bluetooth, as is the induction cooktop. You download the iOS or Android app and select a recipe. The app connects to the cooktop and walks you step by step through what you need to do. The app tells the burner what temperature is required for each stage of cooking. At the same time, the burner is keeping track of the temperature on the pan's surface, so if it's getting too hot, the burner will automatically lower its temperature or vice versa.

The 11-inch wide pan looks similar to other stainless steel cookware you might see in a store, but with some notable differences. You can't put the pan in the dishwasher or the oven, and the company advises against using it on a cooktop other than the Hestan Cue induction burner. Fortunately, the pan is easy to clean, and the recipes in the app don't require additional steps in the oven.

The Hestan Cue induction burner is 12.5 inches wide and weighs 5 pounds. Similar to the FirstBuild Paragon cooktop, it's hard to store, so you'd have to make a permanent place for the Cue on your countertop. You can control the burner manually through the app by setting a specific temperature or a more general cooking level. You can also adjust the cooking level on the unit itself. If manual cooking isn't your thing, just select a recipe and the Cue will take care of the temperature for you.

The Hestan Cue's app provides a wonderful way to try new recipes and learn how to perform cooking tasks. This is accomplished through videos that the app shows with each step of a recipe. For example, if you select the boneless pork chop with sweet apple and onion sauce recipe, there are videos that show a chef zesting a lemon, chopping garlic, slicing onion and julienning an apple and carrying out every other part of the recipe. This is a handy tool if you're rusty on your technical cooking skills or just want to make sure you can properly dice a potato.

The app's recipes range from basic (bacon, grilled cheese sandwiches) to the more refined (trout amandine, dill and caviar emulsion). The app recipes I tried came out well, but I noticed many of the protein main dishes relied on the addition of a sauce to really heighten the flavor. For example, the boneless pork chop I cooked tasted fine, but it was the accompanying bacon-bourbon glaze that really made the dish sing.

The Hestan Cue also had problems with even cooking, despite its responsive temperature control. Let's take a look at one of the steaks I cooked.

Because the steak was of an uneven thickness, its doneness varied from medium to well done throughout the same cut of meat. You get better results with a method like sous vide, in which food items cook more evenly thanks to a circulating, temperature-controlled water bath that cooks the food through a plastic bag in which it's encased. The steak showed that even a $650 smart skillet and burner has the same problem as a normal pan and cooktop.

If you trust yourself more than the app, you can control the temperature and power level yourself. The burner responds very quickly when you put your desired temperature into the app. However, I wish the app provided basic temperature guides for common dishes if you'd like to cook on your own.

The Hestan Cue cooking system delivers on its promise to teach you how to cook and is at its best when you select recipes from the app. This Bluetooth-connected pan and single burner are responsive to one another to keep dishes at the proper temperature. But don't turn to it for simple recipes -- this is a system for a home cook who cares about garnishes, emulsions and other next-level cooking steps. Unfortunately, the $650 cost is still too high to get the Hestan Cue onto the countertops of many folks who could benefit from this system."

                Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Candle

Philips Hue has long vied for domination of the smart LED lighting market, and it's leading the charge into color-changing candelabra bulbs ($154.99 at Amazon.com), too. Up until now, the best smart LED bulbs that would fit into most chandeliers or ceiling fans came from Feit, a smaller-name company with only middling candelabra bulbs.

Although we haven't tested the new Philips bulbs yet, the company's record should give people hope. Its new White and Color Ambiance Candle bulbs will be available in Europe starting in April, and in North America later this year. (We don't yet know if it'll come to Australia.) The downside is that the Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Candle bulb will cost $50 (or about £40 or AU$65), which is significantly more than many competing bulbs (which often cost closer to $10).

The big advantage the Hue Candle bulbs have is the existing Hue ecosystem -- a system compatible with HomeKit, Google Home and Amazon Echo. You'll be able to control the Candle bulbs along with other Hue bulbs using voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa.

At this time, the Hue Candle bulbs won't be included in lighting kits, like this Philips Hue Starter Kit. That means people already invested in the Hue ecosystem will likely be the earliest adopters.

Here are the specs for the White and Color Candle bulbs:

                Ezviz Mini 360 Plus

When standard fixed-angle security cameras don't cover enough ground, pan/tilt models make smart alternatives -- they raise, lower and rotate to capture more of a room.

The $80 Ezviz Mini 360 Plus has a 340-degree panning angle and an 80-degree tilting angle that you can either adjust manually or set to ""auto-tracking"" mode to follow motion activity for you. It also works with  	 	IFTTT and comes with local as well as optional cloud storage for an additional fee. The Mini 360 Plus has limited availability in the UK and isn't currently sold in Australia; the price converts to roughly £65/AU$105 at the current exchange rate.

Unfortunately, the Mini 360 Plus wasn't particularly good at following motion activity -- one of its core features. I'd look instead to the $150  	 	Zmodo Pivot for a true 360 cam that tracks activity without stumbling.

Ezviz's Mini 360 Plus looks nice enough. It's a smallish adapter-dependent orb that you can install and connect anywhere in your home over Wi-Fi. It also comes with an Ethernet port if you want to tether it directly to your router. This model has a relatively narrow 92-degree diagonal field of view, but its 340-degree panning angle and 80-degree tilting angle allow you to see much more.

To get started, download the Ezviz app on your Android or iPhone gadget of choice, then follow the step-by-step tutorial to get the camera up and running. I already had an Ezviz account from testing out the $70 fixed-angle  	Ezviz Mini, but the configuration process took less than 10 minutes from start to finish.

The Ezviz app isn't as streamlined as I'd like. You really have to poke around to find the settings and other features you're searching for. It also looks dated and is in definite need of a design refresh.

This unfortunately extends to the app's overall usability, particularly when you're trying to manually pan or tilt the camera. Open the camera's live feed and select the arrow icon on the far left. From there, select the Pan/Tilt option.

This takes you to a seemingly blank half of the screen, but tap it and an arrow will appear. The odd thing is that you don't have a lot of control over which arrow appears first -- selecting the top of the screen, for instance, might engage the left arrow, sending the camera in the wrong direction.

The camera's rotations are also a little noisy -- not ideal for a discreet device like a security camera.

In addition to its pan and tilt functions, the Mini 360 Plus also offers:

I set up an IFTTT rule that connected the Ezviz camera to the   Ecobee3 thermostat installed at the CNET Smart Home -- whenever the Ezviz cam detected activity, the Ecobee3's settings changed. You can also connect smart lights and other compatible smart home devices to the Mini 360 Plus through IFTTT. Find out more here.

The Mini 360 Plus has solid HD live streaming in both day and night mode. I also had a couple of (mostly) clear conversations using the app's two-way talk function, but its motion detection and related auto-tracking features fell short.

I received consistent notifications whenever the camera detected movement. The problem is, it also detected activity when the only movement was a shadow shifting in the light. At first I thought this might be due to its motion sensitivity setting, but the camera's default setting sits right in the middle between no motion detection and very high detection sensitivity. At this setting, phantom alerts shouldn't be an issue.

Its auto-tracking feature was disappointing, too. When I walked slowly in front of the camera's field of view, it tracked me pretty well. But it struggled when I walked at a slightly faster pace, to the extent that it regularly gave up and stopped following me. Zmodo's Pivot does a much better job tracking activity, likely due to its 360 degrees of built-in motion sensors.

80 bucks is an excellent price for a home security camera, but that still isn't enough to recommend the Ezviz Mini 360 Plus. Yes, it's a fine live streaming device, but its core function -- 360-degree panning -- has serious limitations. I'd opt for   Ezviz's less expensive Mini cam instead if you simply want an affordable live streaming camera. And I'd take a close look at the Zmodo Pivot if you're looking for a reliable 360-degree-tracking camera.

Nobody likes doing laundry. And even after you've washed and dried everything, you still have to fold it all and put it away. Bummer.

Fortunately, startup Seven Dreamers wants to help out with this  everyday chore in the form of Laundroid, an imposing  laundry-folding-robot that looks kind of like a bottom freezer fridge.

Here's how it works:

Toss  up to 30-40 pieces of clothing into the drawer in the bottom. Laundroid  is then supposed to be able sort through what's inside and get to  folding. Its built-in AI and image analysis distinguishes among  t-shirts, pants and even underwear. It isn't able to fold socks, though.

From there, the robotic arm inside the appliance will pick up a single item at a time and spend the next 5 minutes or so folding it. No, it isn't very fast, but I suppose it's better than doing it yourself. Seven Dreamers also has a related Android and iPhone app for remote access to the bot.

We saw Laundroid previously as a prototype (it's been in development since 2005), but Seven Dreamers plans to open preorders worldwide in March. Pricing hasn't yet been announced.

In addition to this Laundroid unit, the company also plans to introduce a custom version for hospitals and nursing homes in 2018, as well as an all-in-one washer, dryer and laundry folder in 2019. In the meantime, we hope to track down a review unit of Laundroid to try out for ourselves at the CNET Smart Home.

Most of us never want to have to think about your HVAC system. Fortunately the Breezi Airpulse, launched at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, is here to help further that cause. It'll supposedly allow you to spend less time worrying as the AirPulse will keep an eye out for problems on your behalf.

The AirPulse is a Bluetooth sensor that sticks into the filters near your air vents. From there, it senses the pressure on either side of the vent to gauge the life of the filter. You'll be able to check on the filter's status on your phone using Breezi's iOS or Android app.

You'll also receive a push notification when your filter nears the end of its life. The tip of the Airpulse -- the side inside the filter -- also has acoustic sensors. The HVAC pros that started Breezi programmed Airpulse to listen for specific frequencies in the way the air is blowing. Based on the type of HVAC system you have, supposedly, AirPulse can use the sound of the air blowing past it to diagnose potential problems before you'd normally notice them.

Due out this Spring, you'll be able to buy the Breezi AirPulse for $30, or you can sign up for a subscription service for $20 a month that includes two AirPulses, and automatic replacement of your vents when they run out of life.

Weirdly, Breezi doesn't use Bluetooth 5 yet, even though Bluetooth's showing off the longer range version of the signal prominently at CES. Breezi's reps assured me that's an upgrade they'd like to implement in the near future."

Incipio brought some new smart gadgets to CES, including a new $100 ""CommandKit"" Wi-Fi power strip that you can control using both Siri and Alexa voice commands.

With four automatable outlets that you can can control independent of one another, this thing is basically a four-way  WeMo Switch that'll let you automate four things at once. Aside from syncing it up with Apple HomeKit or with one of Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices to control it with your voice, you'll also be able to turn the outlets on and off from Incipio's app, or by scheduling them to turn on and off at specific times.

That Apple HomeKit compatibility also lets you control the outlets using Apple's Home app on your iPhone or iPad. You can also pin outlets to the Control Center, then swipe up and tap to turn them on and off -- no app needed.

The power strip's other big trick is that it'll track the energy usage of whatever you're plugging into it. That's a nice little bonus, and an added value if you're looking to cut your consumption. Automation can help with that.

At $100 (about £80 or AU$140, converted roughly), this is definitely expensive for a power strip, but it costs a lot less than you'd spend on four switches from iDevices or Belkin WeMo. Provided you've got four things right next to each other that you're ready to plug in and automate, it sounds like it might be a smart buy once it hits the market this summer. We'll keep an eye out for it."

Oria, its new $150 bedside device (roughly converted to £122 or AU$207) going on sale in summer 2017, patented scents around users' rooms to help them fall asleep faster, and sleep more deeply. Whether it actually accomplishes that purpose remains to be seen.

For now, Oria is a pretty one-dimensional product. It is connected to Wi-Fi, so integration with other platforms is a possibility for the future, but nothing is concrete yet. But it is special in one way: It holds a receptacle for recyclable scent capsules (each lasting about two months with daily use), and a fan for dispersing their aromatic contents around the immediate vicinity of the user.

Sensorwake's two patented scents are designed specifically to help users get to sleep faster, and stay in deep sleep more consistently. The company's in-house specialists and business partners cite their own research indicating Oria gets users 40% better sleep. Without third-party corroboration, however, it's impossible to gauge how beneficial the device will actually be.

Even Sensorwake acknowledges aroma is inextricably linked to memory, making it practically impossible to design a device of this sort with broad appeal. Its detailed descriptions of its scents (""powdered rose, peach and pear, with notes of talc and musk"") certainly sound appealing, but not necessarily effective for all users.

Despite my skepticism, though, Oria will likely work at least on an atmospheric level -- much like scented candles and incense. The only problem is, most candles and incenses don't cost $150."

Sleep Number is doing its part to combat frosty toes with its new 360 Smart Bed. Yes, the 360 actually has built-in tech that warms the foot of the bed for you as you're falling asleep so both you and your partner can slumber more comfortably.

In addition to its foot-warming capabilities, the 360 Smart Bed also claims a couple of other advanced features:

Of course, the 360 Smart Bed also comes with the same SleepIQ app for Android or iPhone as the company's It Bed. That means you'll still be able to change the firmness settings of your  mattress yourself, check how well you slept the night before and how well you have been sleeping for the past week and month.

As part of SleepIQ's software, you can also integrate the 360 Smart Bed with products from Nest, Fitbit and other manufacturers. I got the chance to test out this functionality over six weeks of sleeping on the It Bed. While it was easy to pair partnering products to the bed, the integrations didn't help me improve my sleep.

But Sleep Number has introduced a lot of updates and new features since I started testing the It Bed in the fall. Not only can SleepIQ now differentiate between when you're in bed but awake and when you're asleep, it now offers even more personalization. Here's an example straight from Sleep Number's official 360 Smart Bed press release:

This all sounds pretty good, but we won't know exactly how well it works until we get our hands on a 360 Smart Bed. Sleep Number plans to introduce 360 beds in stages throughout the year. While the team hasn't yet shared pricing information, Sleep Number will offer a variety of mattress and bases and expects their cost to be close to the brand's existing products.

Click here to find out what else is happening at CES 2017.

Snore-no-more: Sleep Number says its 360 bed reads biometric cues to find out if someone's snoring. If they are, the dual-sided adjustable bed is designed to raise just the snorer's head to reduce the sound.Self-adjusting mattress: According to Sleep Number, your ideal mattress settings change based on your sleep position. So, if you happen to switch from your back to your side midsleep, SleepIQ software should notice and deflate the mattress slightly to optimize your comfort.

                Everspring Z-Wave Wireless Flood Detector

Flood sensors ($35.94 at Amazon.com) might seem simple -- and on one level they are: they simply use probes to set off an alarm when they make contact with water, which increases the conductivity between them. But despite that relative simplicity, there's also a lot of room for creative design by the companies that make flood sensors. Some have water-sensing probes attached to their bodies, while others have cables with twisted probes embedded in them for long sensing range. And then there's Everspring.

The Everspring Z-Wave Wireless Flood Detector has a single wire that stretches about 8 feet, and at the end of it: a two-prong probe. While Everspring's $40 device certainly isn't as feature-rich as others on the market, it meets a very specific need, and does so reliably. The problem is, that need is too niche for most users.

Here are the Everspring Flood Detector's features:

Everspring doesn't have temperature or humidity sensing. It doesn't have tilt-sensing. Really, it has very few features to speak of, besides that long wired probe. Granted, that wire allows for easy monitoring of sump pump well water levels without letting water anywhere near the device itself. But is that feature alone worth $40?

Everspring's device has a bigger problem: it essentially does exactly what the Aeotec Flood Sensor does, but for more money. Although in rare instances having an 8-foot wired probe might be useful, for the majority of users, it's unnecessary.

While Everspring performs reliably, it simply doesn't boast enough distinguishing features to recommend it over more useful and affordable alternatives.

                Honeywell Lyric T5 Wi-Fi Thermostat
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/honeywell-lyric-t5-wi-fi-thermostat/review/|Honeywell Lyric T5 review:|"

While Nest was busy rolling out next-gen versions of what is essentially the same $250 thermostat, Emerson, Ecobee and now Honeywell were hard at work developing connected models with major smart-home partnerships that cost significantly less money.

Honeywell's Lyric T5 is the least expensive Wi-Fi thermostat I've reviewed to date at $150, a whopping 100 bucks less than Nest. It works with Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa and it has geofencing functionality. Bonus: Honeywell says its updated Lyric app offers ""improved [geofencing] performance"" and I have to agree. The T5's geofencing feature worked flawlessly for me during testing.

The outdated font on the thermostat's display may look like something straight out of the 1995 Sandra Bullock thriller ""The Net,"" but I like everything else about it -- especially the price. Definitely consider Honeywell's Lyric T5 if you're on the hunt for a more affordable smart thermostat with solid performance.

There are dozens of different home HVAC systems, wiring arrangements and settings. Ask a professional or a DIY-savvy friend if you have any questions about your specific setup. That said, Honeywell's Lyric T5 is really easy to install if you already have a C-wire configuration. Not sure? Check out Honeywell's Quick Install Guide for more details.

If you already have a C-wire in place and are lucky enough not to have to drill additional holes in the wall or repaint any newly-exposed areas, you can get this thing up and running in 10-15 minutes. After that, download the Android or iOS Lyric app and either create an account or use existing credentials to log in to your account.

The app takes the pairing process step-by-step. Just pick ""Lyric T5"" from the ""Select a device to install"" page in the app and answer the questions that follow to make your way through the configuration. At one point, it will transition to selecting options on the thermostat itself -- that's where you'll start to get a feel for the touchscreen.

Like I said in the intro, the font and general layout of the thermostat display is a little wonky. I don't exactly dislike it, but it looks dated. I wasn't quite sure how it worked right away, either, because a modern touchscreen combined with a screen that looks like it was ripped from the early PC days is an odd juxtaposition. But once you get used to it, it's responsive and easy to use.

If you want, you can stop there and simply use the app to create custom  schedules for 7-day programming  (you can also create  schedules directly on the thermostat), adjusting the temperature  on-demand anywhere you have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection.

But you can also turn on Apple HomeKit, an option that lets iPhone users  control the thermostat with Siri and geofencing, an option that uses mapping software to let  you set a radius around your house. That radius acts as a Home/Away threshold tied to your phone's GPS location. When you leave, the thermostat should automatically switch to Away mode. And when you come back it should automatically switch back to Home mode.

Both HomeKit and geofencing are optional, but are easy to configure directly within the app. They worked well, too. With HomeKit, you can ask Siri to, ""Set the CNET Thermostat (the name I gave the T5 in the app) to 70 degrees"" and other related commands and she'll oblige. The same is true for geofencing.

Unlike the $200 Honeywell Lyric thermostat, which will continue to sell in stores and had very spotty geofencing functionality when I tested it, the Lyric T5 was responsive and accurate -- I got alerts every time I crossed in and out of the threshold I set, and the Home and Away temperatures it automatically defaulted to were consistently correct.

Note that geofencing performance can vary based on your location, cellular carrier and other factors. A Honeywell representative told me, ""The latest version of the Lyric app features updated Geofencing features, including the addition of a sleep setting, improved performance and triggering and enhancements to save battery life on mobile devices."" Based on my experiences with the Lyric T5, I do feel like geofencing performance has improved, but it's difficult to say how well it will work for every user.

One key reason I see the Lyric T5 as a better value than the similarly priced Emerson Sensi and Ecobee3 Lite relates to its geofencing capabilities. Where the Sensi and the Ecobee3 Lite are essentially programmable thermostats with related apps and third-party integrations, the T5 is a programmable thermostat with a related app, third-party integrations and geofencing. That puts it more in line with pricier thermostats like Honeywell's higher-end Lyric thermostat, the Ecobee3 and Nest -- all models that offer some sort of ""smarts"" that allow for more advanced automations.

If that wasn't enough, the Lyric T5 also works with Amazon Alexa products. So, if you happen to have an Echo, an Echo Dot or a Tap lying around, you can enable the Lyric Skill in the Alexa app and go about voice control that way. Like HomeKit, just say, ""Alexa, set the CNET Thermostat to 68 degrees."" Occasionally she didn't hear me clearly, but it worked most of the time.

Honeywell says an IFTTT channel is in the works, but I'd like to see even more integrations -- Samsung SmartThings, Wink and Google Home would help round out the Lyric T5's smart home partnerships.

For the first time since Nest introduced its inaugural Learning Thermostat in 2011 (now in its third iteration), the smart heating and cooling innovator has some serious catching up to do.

Sure, Honeywell's $150 Lyric T5 is just one connected thermostat, but its relative affordability is hard to overlook and it's the third manufacturer I know of to offer a less expensive smart alternative. If I can get Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa compatibility, as well as impressive geofencing performance from a model that costs $100 less, why would I pay for Nest? That question is becoming increasingly relevant, but Nest's Google Home integration could buy the startup-turned-Alphabet-brand some time.

I still prefer Nest's design and usability over all other connected thermostats, but the Honeywell Lyric T5 is my current favorite in the market for its smart integrations, performance and overall value."

                Lifx Color 1000 BR30 Wi-Fi LED Smart Bulb
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/lifx-color-1000-br30-wi-fi-led-smart-bulb/review/|Lifx Color 1000 BR30 Wi-Fi LED Smart Bulb review:|"

If money were no object, I'd have Lifx Color 1000 BR30 LEDs all throughout my home. They're bright, they're efficient, and they offer better-looking colors than Philips Hue, plus comparable smarts thanks to integrations with the Nest Learning Thermostat, with IFTTT, and with Amazon's Alexa.

But money  	is an object, and these LEDs aren't cheap -- 50 bucks each, to be exact, or about £40/AU$65. It's a lot of money for a light bulb no matter what currency you're using, and that stops me from recommending them outright (or, you know, filling my house with them). Plus, they don't work with Apple HomeKit, which might be a deal breaker for the iOS faithful.

Still, these are very good smart bulbs, and a justifiable splurge for owners of the Amazon Echo smart speaker thanks to those Alexa controls. You don't need these color-changing smart bulbs, but it's perfectly fine to want them, and fine to buy them, too, if  you're looking for a little more color in your day to day.

As LED floodlights go, the Lifx Color 1000 is flat-out great. With nearly 1,000 lumens at its brightest setting it's a legitimate upgrade in light output over the kinds of common 65W incandescents you might use it to replace. Bulbs like those typically put out less than 700 lumens.

It's efficient, too, drawing just 11 watts (oddly even less than  the white-light version of this bulb, which doesn't do colors and isn't quite as bright). With an 11W power draw, it'll save you about six or seven dollars per year in energy costs over that 65W bulb, all while putting out significantly more light.

Lifx bulbs are also terrific when it comes to color accuracy, and capable of producing rich, vivid tones at just about every shade. They're certainly  better color-changers than Philips Hue, which struggles to put out true tones of green and cyan due to weak blue diodes.

The smarts are on point, as well. The integration with Amazon's Alexa is particularly strong (I know because I own a couple of Lifx bulbs along with an Amazon Echo smart speaker, and use Alexa to control my lights each and every day).  Sync your Lifx account with the virtual assistant in Amazon's Alexa app, and you'll be able to ask her to turn things on and off or turn them up and dim them down.

Tack ""tell Lifx"" onto your command, and she'll be able to change the colors, too, a la ""Alexa, tell Lifx to change the table lamp to purple."" It works like a charm for me, and makes it fun and easy for anyone to play with the novelty of your color-changing bulbs.

Lifx bulbs also work with the free online automation service IFTTT (if this, then that). It's one of the best lighting-related channels on the service, with lots of options for how your automated lighting changes can run, along with  a veritable plethora of IFTTT-friendly smart-home gadgets and services to sync up with.

Of course, there's also the Lifx app, available on Android, iOS, and Windows devices. Pull it out and sync up with your bulbs over Wi-Fi, and you'll be able to turn things on and off with just a tap, or adjust their color, brightness, or color temperature with a smooth, easy-to-use color wheel (two of them, actually -- one for colors, and one for white shades). You can also schedule the lights to turn on and off at specific times, complete with extra controls for things like fade duration.

These lights aren't perfect, though. The app's preset themes are pretty underwhelming, especially the color cycle option. It offers lots of specific controls for how the colors should cycle, but it doesn't let you pick specific colors to cycle through, and it often seems to get stuck after just one or two color changes.

A lack of support for Apple HomeKit is a notable omission, too. With HomeKit, you'd be able to automate the bulbs alongside other iOS-friendly smart-home gadgets in Apple's Home app, and you'd be able to control them with Siri commands, too. None of that is supported at this time, though, and that isn't likely to change unless Lifx releases an all-new generation of HomeKit-friendly bulbs. If HomeKit is important to you, then you're probably better off going with Philips Hue.

These are undeniably good smart bulbs, but they aren't a must-buy. For starters, they're off-puttingly expensive at $50 each (though, in fairness, that's the same price you'll pay for a Philips Hue floodlight). They also missed the boat on Apple HomeKit, which is becoming an increasingly relevant platform for the connected home. The white-light only Lifx White 900, which costs $20 less, seems like the smarter buy to me.

Still, it's hard to argue against the quality of these bulbs. They offer bright, efficient performance, color accuracy that's dead-on, useful integrations with IFTTT and Alexa, and an app that's easy to use. They're also just a lot of fun, especially for kids. You could splurge on worse."

If you're looking for a better way to monitor the front porch of your home than peering through the peephole, then the €350 Bosch Eyes Outdoor, unveiled at IFA 2016 in Berlin, just might be the ticket. Designed to function as a light, motion sensor alarm, and intercom all in one handy contraption, the Eyes Outdoor will also have its camera peeled for any activity that happens outside your door.

If the Eyes Outside sounds familiar, it should since it mirrors practically all of the capabilities of the $199 Kuna Light Fixture. The same is true of the Netatmo Presence, announced this January.

As for when and where you'll be able to purchase an Eyes Outside camera, Bosch expects the product to arrive by the end of 2016, initially in Germany, Austria and the UK. Company reps did say a US launch of the product is in the works but declined to disclose specific timing or a price.

I love raising my baby in a city, if only because I'm able to maintain a life without too much trouble. But with cities often comes pollution, and air-quality problems have been linked to major long-term health concerns -- especially for young children. It's not just an outdoor problem, either. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found indoors, including carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia, and plenty of others.

But now iBaby, a company that's built a name as a popular developer of baby monitors, has a solution: a smart air-quality monitor and purifier called the iBaby Air. The device just reached full funding on Indiegogo, but I got my hands on one before it launches later this year. Here are four things you need to know about iBaby Air.

Sure, plenty of gadgets monitor your home for carbon monoxide or smoke. Some even track dust, pollen, and CO2 levels. But few devices offer the sort of all inclusive air-quality monitoring that iBaby says it does. Of course, how well it tracks VOCs still has to be tested. But it's at least trying something few consumer devices in the past have done.

Aside from tracking air quality in the moment, the iBaby Air maps your home's air quality over time, letting you see improvements as you make them. While another recent crowdfunding project called Wynd is doing something similar, iBaby Air sweetens the deal with a speaker for music and two-way audio, a full RGB color nightlight and other features in the app.

The white finish looks fine, and the additional optional wood finishes will fit nicely with different home aesthetics. Plus, unlike those conventional air purifiers that take up a whole corner of your house, the 6-inch-tall iBaby Air can just perch on a mantle, out of the way.

That's not expensive, but it's not cheap either. Standard air ionizers cost around $60 to $80. The iBaby Air adds a lot of smarts to the package, but whether that merits the extra 70 or 80 bucks will depend on what users are looking for."

There are connected toothbrushes that track how long you brush. Philips Sonicare's newest model also wants to build a 3D map of your mouth.

The Philips Sonicare Flexcare Platinum Connected toothbrush, announced today, is the company's first adult brush with an app. And it has nearly as many features as its product name has letters. In addition to Bluetooth (of course), the brush adds accelerometer and gyros plus pressure sensors so it can tell what direction and angle the brush is facing, and how hard you're brushing. It shows this data and maps it against a 3D tooth map on an iPhone or Android app for real-time feedback as the brushing happens. I went to check out the brush, briefly, because I was curious. But I didn't get to brush with it.

The brush and app can handle personalized dental hygiene regimens, according to Philips. You can customize areas to target in the connected tooth-map phone app. This will also track your brushing habits over time. The brush senses which tooth you're near, and advises accordingly in-app. A dental hygienist could go over the personal tooth-map with the patient and address the trouble areas, and the brush would incorporate that extra coaching in the daily guidance. Extra attention to one tooth, or maybe taking it easy on the rear ones that just got crowns.

Besides location sensors, Philips' connected brush has features of the existing top-end Sonicate brush, the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Platinum Sonic: pressure sensors with vibrating feedback, three brushing modes with different intensity levels, and a two-minute timer.

Away from a phone the toothbrush won't handle the location-based brush guidance, but will do everything else and sync back to the phone app (it can last two weeks on a charge).

The brush costs $199.99 and is coming out later this summer. International pricing isn't available but this converts to about £138 or AU$267. I didn't get a chance to brush with one, but I watched a brief demo of how the brush recognizes location and position. I'm a pretty lax brusher, and I have no idea how my dentist would feel about this brush. Philips claims that people who have tested learned to brush better. Will it train me? I have no idea, but I'm curious. I'm just not sure I could put up with the hassle."

                4moms mamaRoo
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/4moms-mamaroo/review/|4moms mamaRoo review:|"

In the weeks before the birth of our first child, my wife and I emptied our bank accounts buying every baby accessory we could imagine using even once or twice. After our son was born, we spent hours repackaging and returning a lot of them, because we found out the kid had his own preferences. He hated the first bassinet we bought for him, but loved the swaddling cloths. He hates to be cold, but he likes baths. And during this process, figuring out which devices to invest in took some experimentation.

At $270 (about £186 or AU$361), the 4moms MamaRoo is an expensive experiment -- especially for new parents being bombarded with medical bills and nighttime diaper runs -- but it's one that could pay off. Essentially, the device is a Bluetooth-connected chair that, according the advertisements, ""moves like you do."" 4moms attempted to replicate the range of movement patterns and speed that parents use to rock their children to sleep. Whether it calms your child will depend on his or her particular preferences, this base mechanic works really well.

The MamaRoo isn't a perfect product. It has major technical shortcomings --particularly with its basic mobile app and terrible speakers. Even in light of these issues, I like the MamaRoo. Unless you've got $270 lying around, though, you should wait to buy it until you're sure it's what your baby needs.

The 4moms MamaRoo is basically an adjustable seat that can rock your baby in various patterns at a few speed levels. The seat can sit up for babies getting a handle on balancing, and it can lie back for newborns. The seat itself is made of a soft multi-plush material that is gentle on the skin (though a slightly less expensive model just has a rough nylon material that you'll have to line with your own blanket), and it's machine washable.

Setting up the MamaRoo is a breeze. The instructions are clear, the pieces fit together simply, and connecting it to your phone with Bluetooth will take a minute at most. I had my MamaRoo up and running in less than 10 minutes.

MamaRoo also features a hanging mobile, speakers, and sound effects to calm the baby. You can control the volume, select the sound effects, adjust the movement speed, and choose the movement pattern, all from an app. It's like you get an extra pair of arms to rock your baby, and it's mostly hands-free for you.

My wife parents full-time, I help as much as I can, and our son is surprisingly relaxed. But we still felt the relief of having a device that rocked and engaged him. For fussier kids or busier parents, MamaRoo could be a lifesaver.

For its creative and well-designed base, MamaRoo's extra features are disappointing. When I first set it up, I could imagine using it to rock my son to sleep, engage him with the mobile, stimulate him with music, and calm him with ambient sounds like a heartbeat, the ocean or rain. Besides its basic function, none of these added features worked well.

The mobile has high potential for a smart baby seat. This one not only looks flimsy and basic, with three suspended balls of different color and design -- it also requires you to manually spin it. Yet the whole idea of this device is to distract kids while parents can finish a little work (or just rest). My son is curious and loves watching new and interesting things, and he was bored with the mobile in under a minute.

The second big weakness is the sound system. If I didn't know what ambient sound I was selecting, I would probably have thought they were all just slightly different patterns of white noise. When using the speaker for music instead, I was even more disappointed. Not only is the top volume about equivalent to my iPhone at 30 percent volume, but the sound quality is terrible. I could barely hear any individual strand of music besides the most percussive mid-levels.

Finally, I love the Bluetooth app control of the MamaRoo, but for some reason, even if I wanted to use my phone's music with the speaker, that doesn't have Bluetooth functionality. So to connect my music to the speaker, I have to walk over to the device, plug in my phone with the included auxiliary cord (which is only a couple of inches long), and leave my phone beside it. Given the issues with sound quality and the lack of Bluetooth speaker connection, after a day or two, I just started using my phone's speakers for music.

If you're looking for good speakers or a device to visually engage your child, then MamaRoo won't cut it. The last thing you want is a $270 investment gathering dust in a corner.

But for parents who can't seem to find any seat or bassinet that their baby likes, the 4moms MamaRoo could make those first few months manageable."

                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/synek-somm/preview/|Synek's wine device Somm goes live on Kickstarter|"

Drinking wine is really fun. In fact, going to Napa Valley to visit wineries and taste expensive wines is one of my favorite trips. But the drinking-to-learning ratio's got to be right. That's why you don't see many people sitting on couches, reading a book on varietals without a glass of pinot in hand to help the information go down more easily.

Here's where smart home tech comes in: Ideally, a smart wine device lets you drink wine, learn about that wine and feel cool all at the same time. I've tested one wine device before and had mixed feelings about it, but the potential is definitely there. And now Synek, the company behind the Counter Top Beer Dispenser, is taking on the project.

With its newly launched Kickstarter campaign, Synek hopes to fund a device called Somm (short for sommelier, a professional wine expert). Essentially Somm will house wine, keep it at ideal temperatures, limit aeration to prevent degradation and, finally, educate users through the companion app. It's a cool concept, and it could be worth the $199 (about £140 or AU$260) pre-order price or $299 (£210 or AU$395) final price -- if it works.

Synek's Somm is a large, freestanding, counter top device. The cartridges that fit into it are much larger than typical bottles of wine. Instead, each cartridge -- called a Sylo -- holds about three bottles' worth. A small chip on the Sylo tells Somm what temperature to keep the wine at and how aerated the wine should be before drinking. When the wine is ready to be poured, a diastolic pump pulls the wine out of a collapsible membrane, aerates it appropriately, and pours the glass.

The mechanism should stop air from contacting the wine in the Sylo, meaning it won't degrade even after you pour a glass. Of course, the Kuvée Bottle was supposed to do that too, but was unsuccessful. Wine is delicate, and oxygen is its enemy. So for now, I'm skeptical of Synek's approach, though hopeful in what its execution could mean for the lifespan of wine.

The educational side of Somm comes through the app. Using Synek's app, Somm will tell you about the wine you're drinking, and it will help you order more. I like the idea, but I wonder if it will be significantly more informative than a quick Google search. And ordering Sylos through Synek will only really seem appealing if it entails discounts.

The mechanics of Sylos could work well. I hope they do! But part of me -- maybe the purist I try to resist -- feels the experience of wine might be diminished if it comes from a dispenser. You won't get Sylos from Synek to display next to bottles. You won't get it for a date night. Somm feels more like a cool party device. And that's where I think its value will be. Getting larger amounts of wine for discounted prices would work well when you're entertaining. And Synek says both old and new world wines will be represented -- a good sign for serving varied tastes.

Synek's Somm looks like an interesting concept with typical pros and cons. But if it gets funded, if development goes well (which is not always guaranteed in crowd-funded endeavors) and, ultimately, if it works, then it could be a solid purchase."

                Hero Smart Appliance
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/hero-smart-appliance/preview/|Forget to take your meds? This smart device and app will remind you|"

It can be hard to remember to take your medicine, whether you're on fluoxetine or Flintstones vitamins. A new smart device wants to use technology to help you keep up with your meds.

The Hero Smart Appliance is a medication dispenser that lets you schedule when it will dole out your pills. The Wi-Fi connected device will also monitor how much medicine you have left, send alerts when it's time for a refill and notify you when a user has taken their medicine (useful if, for example, more than one person uses the machine or if you're monitoring another person's usage). The Hero became available today for online pre-ordering for $399 (about £280 or AU$540); the Hero company expects the retail price to be about $999 (£700 or AU$1,345).

It's pretty easy to operate the Hero. After you enter your name and connect the Hero to the Internet, you type in the name of your medicine, how many doses you need to take and at what time you need to take them. You put your pills into a little container that goes inside the Hero, and it will dispense them into a cup at the appropriate time. You can also access your medicine off-schedule if need be.

The Hero company said the smart appliance could find a lot of use for caregivers who have to monitor another person's medication usage because of the scheduling ability and app notifications. An automatic dispenser could make it easier for someone caring for an older parent, for example, and give them one less thing to worry about. The Hero could also be a boon for folks who take multiple pills and have a hard time keeping things straight -- it's a big step up from those plastic pill holders you can grab at the pharmacy. And even if you only take one pill, the app can help you remember to take it when you should and, in the best-case scenario, stay healthy.

Price is going to be a huge obstacle, however, in getting the Hero to the people who could most benefit from it. There are also limitations on how much medicine can be stored in the device (a maximum of 10) and the type of medicine (pills only, no liquids). The Hero company is exploring options, including Medicare reimbursement in the US, that could help keep costs of the unit down. And the product has a huge responsibility to make sure it keeps all those pill cartridges organized and dispensing the right medicine at the right time.

                Lutron Serena Remote Controlled Shades
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/lutron-serena-remote-controlled-shades/review/|Lutron Serena Remote Controlled Shades review:|"

Automated shades can be a cool feature for any living space, but when you start looking at the market, you might be surprised how expensive outfitting a whole home can be. That said, smart shades and blinds have a lot of potential. They can make windows in hard-to-reach places more accessible, and can be important tools for the disabled or elderly.

Lutron's Serena Remote Controlled Shades can't solve the price problem (each unit costing around $350 at the least, plus $150 for the Caseta Bridge that integrates with Apple HomeKit). But their hefty price tag makes a little more sense than what you'll pay for other smart shades. Not only do they boast features like Siri voice control and geofencing-based automation, they also integrate with plenty of other smart home gadgets, like thermostats and lights.

Despite the pricing and a few performance hiccups, those who need smart shades for a few vaulted windows or a particular bedroom will find a helpful solution in Serena.

Serena Shades are pretty easy to set up. With a power drill and a couple screwdrivers, I was able to set it up within 30 minutes. Add in the 15-minute setup of the Lutron Caseta Smart Bridge, the 10 minutes for the app and the five minutes for the remote, and the whole thing can be up and running in about an hour.

The good news is, besides the Caseta Bridge, you'll only have to buy shades. No extra hubs, no extra remotes. In fact, the only reason you need the bridge is to cut down on battery usage, since Apple HomeKit -- the home integration system Serena uses -- relies on Wi-Fi, which drains batteries fast. So your mobile app communicates with the plugged-in Caseta Bridge, which in turn communicates with the Serena Shades using a low-energy communication protocol.

Once everything is set up, using the Lutron app to control the Shades is a breeze. You can set timed scenes, use Siri voice control, automate commands with Geofencing, and integrate with other smart home gadgets. Here's how each feature stacked up.

Scenes: These are simple to set up in the app, but too basic in their capabilities. Setting your shades to open or close at certain times is nice, and the astronomic time clock even lets you personalize your scenes based on when the sun rises and sets where you live. The problem is, these scenes can't be triggered by anything except time. So you can't set the cellular shades to close and conserve heat if the thermostat's temperature is drifting too low. The only way to use triggers like these would be through IFTTT or Elgato, compatible third-party apps.

Siri: Voice control is one of the biggest appeals to Apple HomeKit. The problem is, Siri is still incredibly finicky. I ended up having to rename my shades because she never understood and responded to ""left shade"" ""middle shade"" or ""right shade."" Plus, despite the name, Lutron's ""Scenes"" don't equal HomeKit's ""Scenes."" That means you can't activate scenes from the Lutron app using Siri.

HomeKit: Serena works with Apple HomeKit, the integration system that uses your Wi-Fi and requires no extra hubs. This partnership works well. To integrate your shades with other gadgets, you just need a router and an iPhone or iPad. Unlike Somfy Motorized Blinds, no expensive whole-home automation system like Savant (or even more affordable system like Lowe's Iris) is necessary.

Integration: Once you have the $150 Caseta Bridge -- which falls between comparable bridges from Somfy ($200) and Philips Hue ($60) -- the Lutron app will let you integrate with Lutron products, select Honeywell thermostats, the Nest Learning Thermostat, certain Logitech gadgets and compatible HomeKit products. While this list isn't the most impressive lineup of smart home devices, Serena works with more products than any other smart shades I've seen.

Geofencing: This GPS-based solution is one way developers have tried to automate smart home tech. Usually using GPS to determine whether users are home or not isn't very reliable. Surprisingly, Lutron's app tracks you effectively -- though with occasional delays -- and can operate your shades based on whether you're leaving home or coming back.

Design: Lutron's Serena design is really clever. First off, you don't need anything extra to install the shades -- they work exactly like dumb shades. Second, the batteries are housed inside the body of the product, unlike others, such as Somfy Motorized Shades. Third, when you need to replace the batteries (which should last between 2 and 4 years, depending on the size and model), you can simply push the plastic tabs suspending the shade, and the body will swivel down and allow you to access the batteries without unlatching the whole thing. The motors are also quiet and smooth, and the response to commands, whether issued by remote or through the app, is consistently quick.

Although the price is too high for most consumers to comfortably afford multiple Serena Remote Controllable Shades, the product is pretty sharp. App control is intuitive, the interface is feature-rich, and the HomeKit integration makes the product's future promising. But until they become more affordable and some of the technical performance errors are rectified (particularly with Siri integration) I can only recommend them for particular needs, like vaulted windows or a specific room."

                Spün Utensil
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/spun-utensil/preview/|Smart utensil tracks your calories with each bite|"

I love food, and I'm a fast eater. So imagine my mixed feelings when I came across the Spün at CES 2016 in Las Vegas. This $75 smart utensil promises to count your calories with each bite and let you know if you need to slow down. This could be a dieter's dream or a foodie's nightmare -- do I really want to know how many calories I'm shoveling in with each forkful?

The Spün (pronounced ""spoon"") is available for pre-order on the company's website, and it will ship in June. Here's how it works: You use the Spün's app to take a picture of your meal. The app uses technology similar to face recognition to identify your food. Once you confirm what you're eating, you use the Bluetooth-connected Spün utensil to eat your dish, and the app will tell you the nutritional information for each spoonful or forkful you take (the utensil has an interchangeable  body for the included spoon and fork attachments) based on sensors that measure the weight of your bite.

This isn't the first smart utensil taking a micro-level look at how you eat The Bluetooth-enabled Hapifork we saw at CES 2013 vibrates when it senses you're eating too fast. Spün isn't quite as aggressive when you need to slow down between chomps -- the app will display your speed and politely suggest that you remember that your food isn't going anywhere (my words, not theirs).

Unfortunately (or fortunately?), neither smart utensil has figured out a way to track the food you eat with your hands, so you can still enjoy a cheeseburger in relative ignorance.

                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/oco2/preview/|Oco is back at CES with an all-new security camera|"

We reviewed the original Oco HD Wi-Fi Camera last March, a live-streaming HD model with a low monthly cloud storage fee. Now the team behind it is back at CES with Oco2, their next-generation security camera.

Oco2 is priced at $149. International pricing isn't available yet, but it roughly converts to £100 or AU$210.

Aside from a clear design update -- the previous Oco cam used the same third-party manufacturer as ArcSoft's Simplicam -- Oco2 also offers a new storage option. Oco2 is also equipped with a microSD card slot so you can save footage locally. This allows you to if you want to store your own video clips rather than sign up for to a fee-based cloud subscription.

This hybrid storage feature isn't exactly new, though. Models like the Ezviz Mini already offer both and  iSmartAlarm's Spot, Netgear's Arlo Q and Icontrol's Piper NV all offer free cloud storage. Still, it's a definite improvement for Oco.

Other key features include:

Oco2 is expected to go on sale this spring, so check back soon for updates.

                Big Ass Solutions Haiku L Series Ceiling Fan
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/big-ass-solutions-haiku-l-series-ceiling-fan/preview/|The newest smart fan from Big Ass Solutions is the most affordable one yet|"

The cheekily named Big Ass Fans made a smart-home splash in 2014 when it unveiled a gorgeous Wi-Fi-enabled ceiling fan packed with intelligent sensor tech. The only problem? That ceiling fan cost over a thousand dollars.

Now, for 2016, Big Ass Fans is back with a new version of that smart ceiling fan that will retail for just $450 -- less than half the cost of the original. Called the Haiku L Series, the ceiling fan comes in white or black and sports the same modern aesthetic as the original.

The L Series takes a different approach to smart features, though. The original Haiku that retailed for $1,045 had the brand's ""SenseMe"" tech built right in, enabling it to run automatically based on presence detection and room-specific climate conditions. With the L Series, the SenseMe tech is pulled out of the fan and relocated to the new Haiku Wall Control unit, which will retail separately for $125.

That smarts-sold-separately approach means that you'll need to spend a total of $575 in order to enjoy the full benefits of a connected ceiling fan. That includes the Haiku's integration with the Nest Learning Thermostat that allows it to work in tandem with your HVAC system to help maintain your home's ideal temperature while lowering your energy bill.

There are new features and integrations planned for 2016, too. Most notable among them: voice control by way of an integration with the Amazon Echo smart speaker. Big Ass Solutions plans on demonstrating the feature in Las Vegas before rolling it out a little later this year.

The new fan and wall control unit are both parts of a new lineup of Haiku-branded smart home devices that the Lexington, Kentucky-based manufacturer is debuting at the Consumer Electronics Showcase in Las Vegas. That new ""Haiku Home"" lineup is actually an entire, smart home-centric division of Big Ass Solutions, joining the two company's other two divisions, Big Ass Fans and Big Ass Light.

Still, it's the Haiku smart fan that's the centerpiece of Big Ass Solutions' ambitions for the connected home. Cutting the price roughly in half is an aggressive step for the traditionally high-end brand, and one that signals a serious push to put the company's unique take on the connected living space into as many homes as possible.

The Haiku L Series fan and the Haiku Wall Control unit will both be available direct from the Haiku Home website by the end of January. The rest of the new Haiku Home line includes smart recessed lighting fixtures that are expected to arrive this April -- beyond that, Big Ass Solutions plans to release a Wi-Fi-connected HVAC unit, though no release date is set just yet."

                TrackR Atlas
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/trackr-atlas/preview/|TrackR Atlas maps your home to help you find your stuff|"

In 2014, a Santa Barbara-based startup called TrackR crowdfunded almost $1.7 million dollars to manufacture TrackR Bravo, a $29 Bluetooth beacon designed to help you track your stuff. The idea was simple -- clip it to your keychain or slip it in your wallet, then pair it with your Android or iOS device to track its location or make it ring next time you misplace something.

Now, just months after the last of the Bravo tags finally shipped out to backers, TrackR's team is back on Indiegogo. This time, they're seeking funds for TrackR Atlas, a $39 Wi-Fi plug designed to make those Bravo tags even smarter.

The promise of Atlas is room-specific location tracking for all of your Bravo tags. Plug Atlas in and it'll ""map out"" the room -- plug enough of them in, and TrackR will be able to tell you which room your missing item is located in. From there, you'll be able to ring your Bravo tag like normal to help find it.

The Wi-Fi connectivity is the real upgrade here, though. The Bravo tags use Bluetooth radios, which means that you can't track them when you aren't in Bluetooth range. With both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, the Atlas plugs fix that shortcoming. They'll stay connected to the tags in your home 24/7, and allow you to monitor them from afar. That seems especially handy for pets -- clip a TrackR Bravo onto your dog's collar, and you'll get an alert on your phone if she ever jumps the fence while you're away from home.

TrackR's also promising compatibility with the voice-controlled Amazon Echo smart speaker -- that means you'll be able to ask Alexa where your stuff's at.

The other big selling point is TrackR's crowd GPS network. If you lose your wallet while you're out running errands and another TrackR user passes within Bluetooth range of its location, the network will update with the new info.

These are some pretty cool claims, but they bring up a lot of questions. How accurate is that room specific item-tracking? If you're tracking your pet, but you don't have enough Atlas plugs to cover your entire home, will you get flooded with annoying notifications every time Rex comes in and out of your system's Bluetooth range? We haven't had the chance to test those TrackR Bravo tags out yet, so it's hard to say how useful they are compared to similar products, like Tile.

TrackR Atlas will ship worldwide, with plugs available for sockets in the US, UK, European Union and Australia. That $39 price point for each plug converts to about £25, or about AU$55, though you'll need to add $10 (roughly £7, AU$14) for shipping outside of the US. We'll try and test the system out in the CNET Smart Home as soon as we can -- once we do, we'll let you know how well it works with a full review."

                Locumi Monkey
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/locumi-monkey/preview/|Monkey will be a doorman for apartment dwellers|"

A young startup called Locumi Labs, which made its debut in Germany with a clever mailbag (in German), wants to go international with a new smart security device that specifically targets apartment dwellers. Monkey will ship in the third quarter of 2016 for $119 or £99 (roughly converted, that's AU$155), which is half the price of many smart locks on the market.

Of course, this isn't exactly a smart home lock; it's a batteryless, Wi-Fi-enabled chip housed in a plastic shell, and it's designed to connect your phone to your apartment's intercom. After installing Monkey, which is built to nestle snugly inside your intercom's case, you'll be able to perform many of the same functions as other smart locks, but through the already-present technology of the intercom. But this small connection, according to Locumi's designers, will bring some big changes.

The first and probably most practical tool Monkey will offer is remote access to apartment intercoms. According to Locumi, Monkey will be compatible with nearly all apartment intercoms -- even older models. The app, in development for both iOS and Android, will send push notifications to users when a guest buzzes from the front door of the apartment building. Users, whether home or away, can then buzz in guests using their phone.

Locking and unlocking doors while away from home is a tough topic for many lock developers. From Kwikset to Yale, most use connectivity like Bluetooth or Z-Wave that requires your mobile devices to be near the lock to access it, and these locks often require a separate hub (for a separate price). HomeKit-enabled locks, like August's upcoming second generation lock and the new Schlage Sense, feature remote access using iCloud, but only with the purchase of a third-generation or later Apple TV. The sparseness of remote capabilities is expected -- major security risks arise if a lock is too easily accessible from a distance. But the industry's caution means few companies have done smart lock remote access well, and almost none have done it cheaply.

Monkey could rise to the remote-access challenge because of one key distinction: it doesn't unlock the door of your apartment, but rather the door of your apartment building. So remote access doesn't represent quite the same security risk it does for other locks. Of course, the Wi-Fi communication between Monkey and your phone will be encrypted, and your home network should already be semisecure, but Locumi's primary focus isn't on reinforcing security -- it's on streamlining entry.

One notable feature, for example, is pretty standard for smart locks, but works particularly well for apartment buildings: timed access windows. You can set up certain times during which anyone who buzzes will be allowed access (think: hosting a party with guests dropping by all evening). But Monkey avoids the discomfort of allowing a stranger into your home when you're away by only allowing access to the building. That way delivery people can easily leave packages outside your apartment door, but inside the building and sheltered from the weather.

Another feature of convenience is the hands-free user entry. The Monkey app will use geofencing to track when your device approaches your apartment building, and a GPS will tell Monkey to buzz you in when you're within a few meters of your front door. The idea of automatic entry is appealing for anyone who hates fumbling with keys at your building entryway and again at your apartment door. But if Monkey's GPS is anything like the one I use when I'm driving, I'm skeptical of how well this function will work. Ultimately, we'll have to wait until we get our hands on the product to know how it performs.

Overall I like the approach of Locumi's project: home security more focused on how to let people in than how to keep them out. That inversion leaves space for real creativity -- addressing issues particular to apartment dwellers like me, who must use keys for two different entryways when they come home. This could also be a relief for renters with dogs that go crazy every time a visitor rings the buzzer. But the Monkey also raises many questions: Will a finicky GPS compromise my building's security? Will the app's remote connection lead to latency problems? Will the Wi-Fi connection be secure enough? Although Locumi assures us Monkey will not jeopardize an apartment building's security, any doubts (and hopes) will have to wait for answers until the product launches next year."

                Angee
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/angee/preview/|Angee promises to look and listen attentively to keep your home safe|"

A security camera with a goal of whole home monitoring, Angee can rotate its head 360 degrees and watch you as you move throughout a room. That might sound creepy, but like the  Netatmo Welcome , Angee is designed to get to know you and your family. Once it learns who's who, the spec sheet says it'll carefully track unknown individuals, but can be told to leave you and your family alone and can even turn to face the wall when you're around.

Complete with Bluetooth door sensors that talk directly to the main camera, Angee aims to keep track of who comes and goes both on your phone via Bluetooth and through voice recognition software built into the camera. If you take your phone beyond the range of the geofence around the sensors, the system will arm. Bring the phone back into range, and it'll disarm. If your phone's dead, you can simply speak a password to lower Angee's guard.

With the system armed, you'll receive an alert if the camera detects motion. You can use the iOS or Android app to see the clip surrounding the trigger, or pull up a live feed.

Designed by electronics startup Angee, Inc, you can preorder Angee now via the company's Kickstarter campaign for the product. At retail, Angee will cost you $430 for the camera and one sensor. A few deals with first come, first serve preorder discounts are still available if you're so inclined. It'll ship anywhere in the world. The price converts to around £283 and AU$612 for our readers in the UK and Australia.

$430 is by no means cheap, given that other capable competitors such as  Nest Cam ,  Piper , and the Netatmo Welcome cost as little as $200. Angee gets points for offering both local and cloud storage of clips for no subscription fee. It'll only record suspicious activity, and it'll fine tune what it finds suspicious over time as it learns your family's behavior. It's also scalable, as multiple cameras and sensors can talk to the same system and communicate with each other about who's home and who isn't.

If you need to scale it, the price will obviously increase further. Angee will talk directly to your router, but the compatible sensors need to be in Bluetooth range of the camera to be effective. So if you have a home bigger than an apartment, you'll probably need to pay for multiple cameras if you want to make full use of the system's ability to monitor all entry points.

Angee tries to stand out by not only packing in voice recognition, but the ability to understand voice commands. Supposedly functioning similarly to the Amazon Echo, Angee will be able to search the Web, remind you of your calendar events, and tell you when members of your family arrived or left. All you have to do is ask. The idea of the Echo's capabilities packed into a rotating security cam is quite appealing to me. And since Angee will arm and disarm itself autonomously, it checks the right boxes in terms of doing enough to look competent and cool, but not so much that it doesn't sound feasible.

That's not to say that I don't have concerns about Angee. Will it lose track of who's home if a person's phone is off and he or she isn't in the same room as the camera? How can it effectively track your kids if they don't have a phone? Perhaps most importantly, how good will it be at voice recognition?

So far, we've seen two cameras with facial recognition, and that's a stretch goal of Angee if it earns enough funds from Kickstarter. Neither of the two existing cameras employed face recognition tech seamlessly, though the Netatmo Welcome came closer than the  ArcSoft Simplicam . I'll be curious to find out if voice recognition is easier to implement than facial recognition.

The daily calendar software is also a stretch goal for Angee, and without it, the voice control and reminder options begin to look bare bones, especially compared to the Amazon Echo. The Echo can interact directly with your phone,  communicate with other smart home devices, and play music from your library. We've also seen a few  voice control hubs fall on their face  in terms of their ability to actually understand what you're saying and respond with useful information.

Between the promise of whole home security, voice recognition and voice commands, geofencing, and motion sensing rotation, Angee has a lot of potential as a central smart home device, but it's also set up quite a few potential pitfalls. It needs to avoid most, if not all of those, to prove worth its $430 price and beat out the steep competition in the connected cam market."

                BedJet v2
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/bedjet-v2/preview/|Bring heat between your sheets with BedJet v2|"

In search of the perfect night's sleep, BedJet v2 is back on Kickstarter and aiming to increase its brain power over the first version of the hot-and-cold fan you slip under your sheets. Already past its goal more than 15 times over, BedJet v2 adds sleep cycle smarts to its temp control system. Complete with customizable settings, BedJet's new brain will aim to help you sleep deeper and longer, and wake up more refreshed by automatically adjusting the temperature of the air it's blowing throughout the night to match the natural changes in your body's temp as you sleep.

BedJet fits a nozzle underneath your bedding, and gently blows warm or cold air over you throughout the night. The original version found success on Kickstarter back in 2013, and is available for $500 from BedJet, LLC's website (the international price is $529, which converts to approximately £340 and AU$717 for our readers in the UK and Australia, respectively). Version 2 adds in those adjustable night-long hot and cold cycles and should ultimately sell for a similarly high retail price, but it isn't available for delivery to Australia yet.

The basics of BedJet v2 will stay largely the same as  the first version. On its website, BedJet rails against the inefficiency and poor design of electric blankets, so BedJet keeps all electronic pieces out of your bed.

The installation video makes the process seem simple enough. Place the engine under your bed and attach it to a nozzle nestled just over your bottom sheet. Connect the two with an expandable hose and secure the hose and the nozzle in place with a bracket held between your mattress and your box spring.

You can then make your bed with your top sheet over the nozzle and when you lie down, you can turn on BedJet with the included remote control or the iOS and Android app. Like the original BedJet, BedJet v2 connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth LE. BedJet blows hot air or cold air, and you can buy a pack of two BedJets along with the company's AirComforter that separates the airflow of the two sides of a queen- or king-size bed. A couple can then set two different temperatures without interfering with the temp on the other side of the bed.

If you don't want the air blowing on you directly, you can put the nozzle over the top of your cover sheet, and beneath your blanket or comforter. BedJet also has a neutral setting for air that's not heated or cooled if you just want circulation. The fan looks to gently lift the sheets as it works, and can supposedly cool off your covers within 10 seconds, and warm them within three minutes. BedJet does specify, though, that the fan should not be used in place of an air conditioning unit, as it's less effective in rooms above 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius).

Since I don't like air blowing on me, I'm not sure how well it'd work for my own sleeping needs. Yes, you can put the air stream above the top sheet, but I think you'd still feel it on your face. And since it needs a cover over it to keep the air stream focused, I'd be worried it would lose its potency on the nights when I toss and turn and kick the covers out of place.

Perhaps the new smarts of BedJet v2 will help with this. The idea is that your body temp lowers as you sink deeper into sleep and raises as you wake up. BedJet gently keeps things cool during those deep parts of your rest, then warms things up to help you rise and shine feeling refreshed. If it works, that means less tossing and turning. BedJet even goes so far as to say it can replace your alarm with this system.

I'm just not sure how precise it can be with your sleep cycles without some sort of  connected sleep monitor. Again, BedJet says you can customize everything via the app, but it's often tough for me to predict how I'm going to sleep on any given night, and if it starts cooling me off before I'm out and ends up waking me back up by accident, I'd be pretty angry.

The basics seem mostly sound here, even if I'm unconvinced of the smarts. If a fan that cools you or heats you from within your bed appeals to you, now is a good time to buy in, as the preorder deals on Kickstarter take more than 50 percent off of the $500 retail price of BedJet v1.

Given that the hardware is already all set, BedJet v2 is also relatively low risk for a Kickstarter project. With an expected delivery date of December 2015, the company will even offer a refund if you don't get your unit by December 24. If it actually leads to deeper sleep and easier wake-up times, BedJet could be money well spent."

                Nest Protect
                                    Second Generation
"|https://www.cnet.com/products/nest-protect-second-generation/|Nest Protect (second generation) review:|"

Nest Labs apparently loves a good challenge. Its ability to transform boring, utilitarian household products into smart devices beautiful enough to make a design giant like  Yves Behar weep (I imagine) is an incredible feat.

And yet,  Nest's original Protect smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) detector  had a big problem. Its 'Wave' feature that literally let you turn off alarms with a gesture was deemed dangerously unreliable after it hit retail, leading to  a recall.

Now, a second-generation Protect has arrived and it's noticeably sleeker and smarter than its predecessor. With a slimmer profile, a new in-app ""silence"" button that allows you to turn off smoke and CO alarms remotely (the original Nest Protect doesn't currently support this feature) and integration with the  Nest Learning Thermostat ,  Nest Cam  and IFTTT, this $99/£89 detector is the best connected one we've seen yet. If you already have a first-gen Nest Protect, I'd skip this upgrade, but I strongly recommend the Protect 2.0 to first-time connected detector shoppers.

Many consumers will still happily settle for the $25 puck of white plastic that functions as the traditional smoke detector. Like its predecessor, the second-generation Nest Protect elevates the aesthetic of the standard issue detector, but its balances that appeal with a set of connected features that let you control the Protect remotely via your mobile device or your account on the Nest Web page.

As before, Nest nails the aesthetic upgrade, thanks to the Protect's white or black finish, square design with rounded edges, and a stainless-steel mesh cover that looks neat and gives smoke and CO a bunch of access points. You might not install it in a place at home where you will often get to admire its looks, but at least when you do, you'll appreciate seeing it.

A ring of colorful LEDs surround the central on-off button, alerting you to the Protect's current status. It goes blue during setup or testing mode, green when everything's fine, white as an optional nightlight that illuminates when you walk underneath it, yellow/orange to warn that there's a potential smoke or CO emergency and red when there's a real smoke or CO event.

You can use the second-gen Nest Protect even if you don't have Wi-Fi (or temporarily lose your Wi-Fi connection for some reason). Whether or not you have Wi-Fi, the Protect unit will issue a loud warning if it senses increasing smoke or CO levels (specifically, it will flash yellow/orange and say, ""Heads up. There's smoke/CO."") And, if there's an emergency,  it will flash red and say, ""Emergency, smoke/CO detected.""

The Protect will also test itself for low batteries or any other concerns regularly, communicate with any other Protects in the house (if one Protect alarm detects smoke, all of the Protects in the house sound) and display a faint white light when you walk underneath it in the dark -- presumably on your way to get a late night snack, a feature it calls Pathlight.

To allow for of all of this functionality, the Protect has built-in sensors to detect electrochemical CO, heat, humidity, occupancy and ambient light, as well as a microphone. Nest also upgraded its smoke sensor with a split-spectrum sensor that's exclusive to the Protect 2.0. This new sensor claims to be better at detecting both slow- and fast-burning fires, which, unfortunately, wasn't something that we could test directly.

With Wi-Fi, you can do a lot more, including naming your Nest Protect(s) hallway/basement/bedroom, etc., opting out of the Pathlight feature, receiving alerts and auto-updates to software, using the Nest Android or iOS mobile apps and Web app, pairing your Protect with the Nest Learning Thermostat, Nest Cam and select Dropcam models for advanced integrations and even accessing IFTTT for third-party automations with color-changing bulbs like those from Lifx and  Philips Hue .

I used an iPhone 6 Plus to set up my Nest Protect. Since I already had the Nest app, I simply opened the app, selected ""Add product"" and followed the simple steps to start testing out the full functionality of the unit.

Given that the Protect has to be installed near your ceiling, it might take you a little longer than a typical plug-and-play smart-home device.  I opted for a battery-powered model so I could test it in different locations; it comes with six Energizer Ultimate Lithium (L91) AA batteries. Installing the hard-wired version yourself (also $99), will also require a basic comfort level with home electrical systems. For the initial setup, it took me about 10 minutes from start to finish. As always, consult a professional if you have any installation questions or concerns.

The screenshots above illustrate the basic setup process -- remove the tab from the battery compartment, add your Wi-Fi information, opt in or out of the Pathlight/nightlight feature and you're basically done, aside from a prompt at the end for a quick safety check. That check consists of pressing the center button on the Protect twice to ensure that it's connected to the network and functioning properly.

Navigating the Nest app is pretty straightforward, but it has some quirks. From the main screen you can initiate a safety check whenever you like to ensure that the alarms are working (you can also do this by pressing the center button on the Protect twice, as I mentioned earlier) and, supposedly, review your history. But, although I've tested the Protect over several days, no history has ever populated in the app. Instead it says, ""Welcome to Nest Protect History. Come back tomorrow to see what your Nest Protect has been up to."" Hm.

The second-generation Nest Protect is certified by Underwriters Laboratories under UL code 217 and follows safety standards outlined by the National Fire Protection Association under NFPA code 72. While we didn't have a safe way to test the Protect's carbon monoxide sensor, we did expose the unit to a fair amount of smoke from both bottled smoke and smoke candles. I also tested it alongside a $50 Kidde smoke and CO detector.

Although it was impossible to control the smoke dissipation perfectly, we conducted several tests and made every effort to expose both the Protect and the Kidde detectors equally -- and the Kidde detector almost always sounded its alarm before the Protect. The Protect starts with a spoken warning before launching into a full-blown alarm, which usually took place around the same time as the Kidde alarm's regular alert, but never before. The Protect's actual siren-blaring alert always started shortly after the warning. Usually, the Protect's alarm was just a second or two behind the Kidde, but it did take what'd I'd consider to be significantly longer (up to 15 seconds longer) a couple of times. Generally, though, the Protect and the Kidde took about the same amount of time to sound their respective alarms.

I did receive alerts on my phone from the Protect, but they weren't always timely; I consistently heard the alarm several seconds to a few minutes before I ever got a notification on my phone. Occasionally, I even received a number of alerts -- a warning alert, an alarm silenced alert and an alert that the smoke had cleared -- all at once and quite long (up to a few minutes) after the initial warning was actually triggered by the Protect unit, as you can see in the screenshot below. Notification response times will always be subject to network latency and the strength of your various wireless and cellular connections. I didn't see enough unreliability here to feel overly concerned, especially given that the more crucial local alarm works as expected.

The in-app silencing feature worked quite well and is a excellent alternative to blindly stabbing at your detector with a broom, but the Protect will override this feature if it decides that there's too much smoke in the area. I like that personally, but it will limit your ability to silence your Protect from the app. In addition, I tested Nest's claims that the Protect won't sound the alarm for something like steam coming from a shower. It worked flawlessly, correctly judging the difference between steam and smoke, although so did the Kidde detector.

I also tested an automatic integration between Nest Protect and Nest Cam users. If you happen to have a Nest Cam or a Dropcam and a Protect, the camera will automatically record during a smoke or CO event and shoot you an email with a link to the footage. This feature worked quite well and makes a lot of sense if you want to try to revisit what happened, but it's only useful if your camera is positioned somewhere near the action.

I also tried a few different IFTTT recipes with Lifx and Philips Hue LEDs (to flash red during a smoke event) as well as triggering the free Web and mobile service to call my cell phone whenever it detected smoke. The light bulb integrations weren't responsive enough for short smoke events, typically flashing several minutes after our test smoke dissipated. But I did like the phone call integration, which was prompt and provided a prerecorded audio version of the push alerts.

The $99/£89 second-generation Nest Protect is a solid smoke and CO detector. It looks great and delivers on the basics -- and then some thanks to its connectedness, especially its silencing feature (the first generation Nest Protect does not currently support in-app silencing). Your home wireless network and your cellular service will always have an impact on the reliability of those smarts. If they're not reliable, you shouldn't invest in those extras here, and generally, this second-gen model doesn't add quite enough to justify upgrading from the original to the 2.0 version today (unless you really want in-app silencing).

And while its in-app history section wasn't working properly, overall my experience with this new Nest Protect was a positive one. You won't find another smoke and CO detector available today that matches the Protect in terms of design and smarts."

                BuddyGuard Flare
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/buddyguard-flare/preview/|Meet Flare, a fresh DIY home security contender|"

Berlin-based BuddyGuard is finishing up a Kickstarter campaign for Flare, its new all-in-one DIY security device that looks like it's part smoke detector, part UFO. With just over a day remaining and more than $160,000 raised, it has already well-exceeded its original $89,271 goal.

Flare reminds me of  Piper  and  Canary , two standalone systems that each come with a camera, a siren, sensors and various other security features.

BuddyGuard's version includes a 1080p camera, motion, tamper and temperature sensors, a microphone, a speaker and a siren. It is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0-enabled and it has a 3G cellular module for uninterrupted access whenever your Internet is spotty. And, you can either power it with a wall plug or with rechargeable lithium ion batteries (the batteries are supposed to last up to three weeks with ""normal usage"").

Setup is supposed to be easy, too. Flare has a magnetic base that's designed to stick to most surfaces with adhesive tape. Then, you just have to stick Flare to its base.

According to BuddyGuard, Flare can tell the difference between you and an intruder and will automatically turn its camera and microphone off if it recognizes your face -- and back again on if it sees someone that its database doesn't recognize. It's also supposed to respond to voice commands, so you should be able to tell it that you'll be away on vacation for a week and it will know to stay active the whole time.

But, you should also be able to use geolocation if you forget to tell Flare that you're leaving. This feature is supposed to access your phone's location to determine whether you're home or away and arm your system accordingly. You can access these various features on Flare's companion Android and iOS app. In addition to its own app options, BuddyGuard has plans for an  IFTTT channel as well.

You've missed your chance for an ""Early Bird"" $195 Flare, but you can still reserve one for $229 (about £149 and AU$300 at the current exchange rate).  Units are available internationally and are scheduled to ship to backers this December."

                Canary Smart Home Security Device
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/canary-smart-home-security-device/|Canary Smart Home Security Device review:|"

If I were a shopper currently in the market for a home security system, I'd be giving Canary a good, close look. With an HD, night-vision camera and a bevy of sensors for things like motion, temperature, and air quality Canary promises to stand guard over the living room and alert your Android or iOS device if anything's amiss, all for $250 and no monthly fees. It's a solid pitch.

That, coupled with a strong marketing push, is why Canary did so well on Indiegogo back in 2013, crowdfunding nearly two million dollars only to follow the effort up with millions more in venture capital  from big names like Khosla Ventures. Canary looked every bit like the real thing, and for those of us in the market for a cheaper, smarter alternative to costly, brand-name security systems, the gadget couldn't get here fast enough.

Well, it's here now, in the living rooms of those Indiegogo backers and on store shelves across the US (Canary isn't shipping internationally just yet, but that price comes out to £170/AU$325, converted roughly). Following a few months of tweaks and firmware updates, many of the initial bugs that held Canary back seem to be more or less resolved, and the 1080p picture quality it offers is right on par with Dropcam.

Canary works as promised, but that doesn't mean that it lives up to its promise of packing complete home security into a single device. There are some glaring shortcomings with how Canary works that keep me from recommending it, especially with worthy competition like  iSmartAlarm's iCamera Keep  and  Piper NV  already on the market. I expect Canary to get better with time as its creators continue to fine-tune the firmware, but if you're buying in today, I'd look elsewhere.

I think that one of the reasons behind Canary's crowdfunding success is that it's a really good-looking gadget. The slick, cylindrical build looks appropriately modern and minimalist in all three colors -- white, black, and grey. It isn't anything close to an eyesore, which is important for a device that needs to be kept out in the open in your living room.

Inside that body is Canary's 1080p night-vision camera, along with the motion sensor that tells it when to start recording; ambient sensors for temperature, humidity and air quality; a 90 dB panic siren; and a Wi-Fi radio to send everything to your Android or iOS device by way of the cloud. A color-changing LED ring on the bottom of the device lets you see what mode it's in at a glance -- green when it's armed, yellow when it's disarmed.

There's a third option, too: Privacy mode. Switch it over, and Canary will essentially go to sleep, ceasing all video and audio recording. Originally, you could only put Canary into Privacy mode manually, but after a recent update, you can set the thing to automatically switch over when it detects you've arrived home, the same as it does with arming and disarming.

For as many features as Canary can claim, it doesn't have everything. Though it boasts a fairly wide, 147-degree angle of view, it won't pan or tilt on command, like  iSmartAlarm's iCamera Keep  will. That camera, along with  Piper NV , will also detect loud noises and then, if needed, sound the alarm -- Canary won't.

Additionally, Canary is currently a walled-off device, with no third-party compatibility to speak of. By comparison, iSmartAlarm can sync up with third-party gadgets  by way of its IFTTT channel, while Piper NV has its own built-in Z-Wave radio to help connect it with things like locks, smart switches and open/closed sensors.

An obvious answer here might seem to be integration with the Nest Learning Thermostat, which could likely put Canary's temperature and humidity sensors to good work. However, Nest already owns Dropcam, and doesn't seem terribly interested in getting cozy with any other connected cameras -- at least not through the year-old Works with Nest initiative, where Dropcam remains your only compatible camera.

I had a rough time getting my Canary up and running when I first previewed the device in January, but I'm happy to report that things have gotten a lot easier in the months since. The process is simple on paper -- just power your Canary, plug it into your phone, and enter your Wi-Fi info into the app.

That second step was my first roadblock last time around. You plug Canary into your phone using a yellow cable that plugs into your headphone jack. From there, Canary will ""listen"" for the Wi-Fi info you enter into the app. In my case though, the gadget couldn't hear my iPhone 5S, even after I followed all of Canary's troubleshooting tips. Finally, I switched over to my iPad, which worked fine.

This time around, I was hoping to be able to get everything set up with just my phone, but that wasn't the case -- the yellow cable problem persisted. Again, I had to jump over to my iPad, where everything worked perfectly. There must be a weird setting on my phone getting in the way of the setup process, but whatever it is, I can't find it, and neither could Canary's troubleshooters.

Once you've paired Canary with your Wi-Fi network, you'll probably need to update the gadget's firmware. This was another sticking point last time, and an even more aggravating one, as I couldn't get the download to work despite repeated attempts and multiple phone calls to Canary's support team. All told, it took a solid day of fiddling before I had Canary up and running.

This time, things went much, much better. The firmware downloaded and updated within a few minutes on my very first attempt, and voila, my Canary was up and running. It's still not a perfect setup process, but it's significantly better than it was, so I give Canary's team credit for making progress.

"" data-image-credit=""Screenshots by Ry Crist/CNET"" data-image-alt-text=""canary-ios-app.jpg"" data-image-filename=""canary-ios-app.jpg"" data-image-date-created=""2015/04/03"" data-image-width=""1298"" data-image-height=""1136"" data-lightbox=""enabled"">

From the Canary app's home screen, you can tap to view your live video feed or swipe up to see a timeline of past recordings. Canary logs these recordings in both armed and disarmed modes -- you can filter out the disarmed clips with a single tap, leaving only the clips that were logged while the device was armed.

You can also tap on the home screen's temperature and humidity readings to access ""Homehealth"" graphs of the conditions in your home. Testing them out at the office, they offered spot-on readings of the temperature and humidity.

I also tested the third Homehealth graph, which records air quality. The air quality graph doesn't distinguish between different toxins, instead lumping everything together on a graph that charts between ""normal"" and ""very abnormal."" To test the thing out, I plugged Canary into an extension cord, took it outside, and set a lit cigarette down right next to it.

Once it had burned down, I went back inside and checked the graphs. Along with the expected jumps in temperature and humidity, there was a big red spike into ""very abnormal"" territory on the air quality graph. I was impressed.

What's more impressive, though, is Canary's video quality. Compared with iSmartAlarm and Piper NV, it looks the clearest to me by far, offering a strong degree of detail, even in night-vision mode. That last bit is key, as the most crucial video this thing will ever record is the clip of a burglar rummaging through your living room in the dark of the night. If you get their face on camera, you're going to want that image to be as clear as possible.

Canary also claims it'll get smarter the more you use it. The learning mechanism here is a tagging feature -- pull up a clip from your timeline, and you can tag it to tell the system what triggered it. The idea is that eventually, Canary will start to recognize what's happening in a specific clip, and whether or not it's relevant to your security concerns. In theory, that means fewer false alarms the more you use the thing.

Those false alarms aren't as alarming as with other systems, though, because Canary won't automatically sound its siren when the system gets triggered. I thought this was a bit head-scratching when I first previewed the device back in January, and expected that Canary's team would at least introduce auto-siren functionality as an optional feature. They haven't, and now that I've spent more time testing the thing out, I understand why.

Put simply, Canary is hyper-sensitive. Every night of my tests, the system was triggered multiple times by things as simple as a car's headlights passing by. During one night, with Canary set up in the front of our office, the system was triggered 22 times.

Canary won't automatically sound the siren if it's triggered -- a mercy, given how easy it is to set the thing off. Instead, if Canary spots something while armed in the middle of the night, it'll alert your phone, and then you'll have to choose whether or not to sound the alarm yourself. Better hope you don't sleep through that alert.

I tried to combat this issue by tagging aggressively, marking each and every clip as ""Shadows"" and telling the system that everything was fine. I wanted my Canary to calm down and stop flooding me with irrelevant alerts that might ultimately drown out a legitimate one. Over the course of my tests, though, it never got any better and never learned to auto-tag anything. Canary's team tells me that it could take a few more months for devices to get significantly more intelligent, but I have to imagine at least a good percentage of the user base giving up before then.

Another key issue with Canary is that I wouldn't receive alerts when I unplugged the thing. That means a burglar could theoretically yank the cord out before Canary noticed them. They'd need to know where the Canary was in your home and get to it in the dark without being seen -- a stretch, perhaps, but still a clear shortcoming. Bottom line: if my security system goes offline, I want to know about it immediately.

Canary's got a lot of room for improvement, but the good news here is that the bugs are largely gone and the hardware is sound. The camera offers exceptional picture quality both in regular mode and -- more importantly -- in night-vision mode. The Homehealth sensors are helpful and accurate. The motion detector doesn't miss a thing. There's good stuff going on under the hood.

That said, there are still too many frustrations with Canary for me to recommend spending $250 on it over the $270 Piper NV or the $150 iCamera Keep. The over-sensitivity all but renders the thing unusable, and the lack of third-party support will be disappointing to anyone who wants to incorporate their security with a larger smart-home setup. I expect Canary will get better as time goes on, but right now, I'm looking elsewhere for my security needs."

                Osram Lightify LED Starter Kit
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/osram-lightify-led-starter-kit/review/|Osram Lightify Starter Kit review:|"

EDITOR'S NOTE, 7/26/16, 12:05 PM EST: Updated to include information about potential security vulnerabilities with products in Osram's Lightify lineup, along with comment from Osram.

Osram's LEDs impressed me with strong performance in the  40  and  60W replacement  categories. This year, the brand is adding smart bulbs to its lighting lineup. Dubbed ""Lightify,"" the new product line offers a variety of different LEDs with Zigbee radios built right in. Buy the $60 starter kit, and you'll get the plug-in Gateway along with a ""color tunable"" smart bulb capable of dialing into the specific warm-to-cool color temperature of your choosing (pricing and availability of that starter kit outside of the US is not yet finalized, but the price converts roughly to about £40, or a little over AU$75).

At about $30 for an individual bulb (about £20, AU$40), the tunable Lightify LEDs cost more than twice as much as the  GE Link LED  or the  Cree Connected LED , but those bulbs don't have control apps of their own like Osram does, and they aren't color tunable, either. Also not color tunable:  Philips Hue Lux LEDs  and  Belkin WeMo LEDs , both of which cost more to get started with than Lightify. What's more, Lightify LEDs are directly compatible with WeMo, opening the door for additional automation controls.

All of that positions Osram in a bit of a smart-lighting sweet spot, making the Lightify kit an attractive starting point for anyone looking to automate their home lighting.

First things first: smart LEDs need to be decent light bulbs. It's nice having your lights turn on automatically in the morning, but much less so if the light quality isn't great.

Osram has a pretty good track record here in our test lab, so I was optimistic about the Lightify LEDs. For the most part, they didn't disappoint. Testing the bulbs out in our integrating sphere, we clocked the brightness at about 850 lumens -- comfortably north of the stated 805 lumens, and plenty bright for a 60W replacement.

That's an especially impressive number given that each bulb only draws 9.5 watts. Do the math, and you'll find that each Lightify LED is putting out almost 90 lumens per watt -- good enough to edge out our previous efficiency winner in the smart LED category, the Belkin WeMo LED. It's also quite a bit better than the Philips Hue Lux LED, which puts out less than 750 lumens from a 9-watt power draw.

Turning to color temperature, the Lightify LED comes in at a nice, accurate 2,680K when set to a target of 2,700K. That accuracy diminishes a bit at the upper end of the scale, though. Cranking to a max temperature of 6,500K gave us light that actually came in at 5,273K. That's still plenty hot, with that bluish-white ""daylight"" quality you're probably looking for, but still, it's off the mark.

As for color rendering, the Lightify LED registers a pretty pedestrian score of 78 when set to 2,700K. Dial the color temperature up, however, and the CRI inches up, too, jumping as high as 83 at that 6,500K setting. That makes sense -- yellow tones are often what end up compromising the color rendering score in LEDs, and they drop away when you raise the color temperature.

You can dim the Lightify LEDs on your smartphone or tablet, though using them with actual dimmer switches is ill-advised, since the two separate dimming mechanisms can clash, causing the bulb to flicker and strobe. The same can be said of pretty much any smart bulb, though.

In Osram's case, the Lightify LEDs will dim down to 5.4 percent brightness at minimum settings. That's a decent result, though it isn't as good as Philips Hue Lux bulbs, which will dim smoothly down to a very impressive 0.8 percent of their maximum brightness. Belkin WeMo LEDs will also dim down a bit lower than Osram, as will  Connected by TCP LEDs .

One other small performance complaint: the Lightify LEDs don't turn on instantly. Flick the switch, and you might notice about a half second pause before the light actually shines. It's a small quibble, but it might be enough of one to annoy lighting sticklers.

I spent a few days testing the Lightify kit out in my apartment, and came away satisfied with how it works. Getting things up and running only took me a few minutes, and I appreciated that Osram's app provided clear, step-by-step instructions as I paired everything up.

You'll start by scanning a QR code on the back of the Gateway to let the app know what it's looking for. Then after plugging the thing in, it'll begin broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal. Join the Lightify network using the model-specific password Osram provides, then select your home network to sync things up.

With the Gateway up and running, it's a breeze to add new lights to the system. That was a relief, as other systems -- most notably  Wink  -- have proven to be a bit finicky when pairing certain devices. With Osram, everything paired on the first try, even after deleting and re-pairing a few times.

The Lightify app offers remote management of each LED you incorporate into your system, with rotary dial-style controls for both brightness and color temperature. Add an RGB, color-changing light to your system, like the $70 Flex Strip accessory, and you'll also find a color selector similar to the one Philips Hue uses.

In addition to remote controls, you'll also be able to program automated lighting changes. For basic on/off scheduling, it's an easy process -- just set the on time, the off time, and which bulb or group of bulbs you want to automate. If you want to schedule specific changes in brightness, color, or color temperature, you'll have to save the desired state of the lights as a ""Scene,"" and then schedule a time for that Scene to activate.

It's worth knowing that security researchers have reported a number of vulnerabilities with the way Lightify products communicate with each other, including a flaw that could potentially allow a hacker to inject JavaScript and web-based HTML code into Osram's web interface. That could potentially lead to browser-based attacks on your network, including the theft of your wireless password and other sensitive data.

I asked Osram about the situation, and received the following comment from Jacqueline Boas, Osram America's head of communications and brand: ""Osram agreed to security testing on existing Lightify products by Security researchers from Rapid7. Since being notified about the vulnerabilities identified by Rapid7, Osram has taken actions to analyze, validate and implement a risk-based remediation strategy, and the majority of vulnerabilities will be patched in the next version update, currently planned for release in August.

""Rapid7 security researchers also highlighted certain vulnerabilities within the ZigBee protocol, which are unfortunately not in Osram's area of influence. Osram is in ongoing coordination with the ZigBee Alliance in relation to known and newly discovered vulnerabilities.""

I've reached out to the ZigBee Alliance for an update on these efforts, and will update this review if and when I receive one.

I also tested the Lightify bulbs out using WeMo, and found that they synced up with the WeMo Link as promised. Color-tunability controls haven't been incorporated into WeMo's app just yet, but I imagine they'll get there soon, although we're also still waiting for a long-promised WeMo LED IFTTT channel. If Belkin finally delivers on those IFTTT lighting controls, it stands to reason that they'd extend to any bulb run through the WeMo Link -- including Lightify LEDs.

Another back door to IFTTT compatibility might be the Philips Hue Bridge, which already supports third-party Zigbee bulbs from GE and Cree, and extends the power of its dedicated IFTTT channel to those bulbs, too. A tweet from Hue's team suggests that Osram bulbs have been tested for compatibility with the Hue Bridge, but I was unable to get any of the Lightify products to pair when I tried it out. It's also worth noting that the Hue Bridge isn't sold on its own -- to get one, you'll have to find one secondhand, or purchase an entire Hue or Hue Lux starter kit.

Last year, I felt that Philips missed an opportunity by not making the  Hue Lux LEDs  color tunable. Now, Osram's beaten them to the punch, with tunable Lightify LEDs set to sell for roughly the same price. Philips is still ahead in terms of platform development and third-party support (the importance of which really can't be overstated), and cheaper smart bulbs from  Cree  and  GE  lead the way in terms of affordability. The Lightify LEDs are still a strong enough alternative to merit a look -- though I'd wait to see how Osram addresses the recent security concerns before buying in."

                Cree Connected LED Bulb
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/cree-connected-led-bulb/|Cree Connected LED Bulb review:|"

Cree was hesitant to add a smart bulb to its best-selling LED lineup, but that changed this year with the addition of the $15 Cree Connected LED. Sharing the build and lighting specs of last year's well-reviewed  Cree 4Flow LED , the new Connected LED adds in a Zigbee radio. Pair it with a control hub, and you'll be able to turn it on and off remotely, or schedule automated lighting changes.

At launch, Cree's smart bulb was somewhat married to the  Wink Hub , which made sense given that you'll buy both off the shelf at Home Depot. Since then, however, we've seen official support roll out for additional control gateways, including  SmartThings  and the  Philips Hue Bridge . You can add the bulbs to the new D-Link version of the  Staples Connect Hub , too, although there isn't official, Zonoff-certified support just yet.

The bulb works well across all of the platforms we've tested it with, and it shares the strong lighting specs of the 4Flow LED that came before it.  Most appealing is the price. At $15 -- just a few dollars more than you'll spend on non-connected competitors -- it ties with the  GE Link LED  as the most inexpensive connected bulb on the market. For basic automated lighting, it's the best option we've tested yet, and our current Editors' Choice winner.

Cree adapted its smart bulb design from last year's 4Flow LED, packing a Zigbee radio into the existing build. That means that this isn't a bulb that goes out of its way to look fancy or newfangled -- instead, it copies the 4Flow's emphasis on mimicking the silhouette of classic incandescents.

I liked that approach with the 4Flow, and I like it with the new Connected LED too, though some might find the plastic build to be a bit cheap-looking, especially when the bulb is turned off.

The new bulb also shares the 4Flow's convection cooling trick, which uses vents to circulate air through the body of the bulb, eliminating the need for heat sinks. That helps bring production costs down, and also means that the bulb is exceptionally light for an LED, weighing in at less than 2 ounces.

The Cree Connected LED shares the same lighting specs as the 4Flow LED, too, and that's largely a good thing. Both claim a light output of 815 lumens, and both clocked in even higher than that in front of our spectrometer -- 835 lumens for the 4Flow, and a very impressive 872 for the Connected LED.

In terms of efficiency, the 4Flow puts its light out using 11 watts, but the number rises to 11.5 watts for the Connected LED on account of the Zigbee radio's power draw. When we tested it out, the number was actually closer to 11.1 watts, so Cree's done a good job of keeping this bulb relatively efficient. Still, it's worth noting that both the  Philips Hue Lux LED  and the  Belkin WeMo LED  are even more efficient, each one drawing less than 10 watts.

Cree also did a very good job with color temperature here, landing extremely close to the stated 2,700K. At 2,696K, the Cree Connected LED lands closer to the mark than any other smart bulb we've tested, so if you're picky about that perfect shade of warm, yellowy light, you'll like this LED.

The one place where Cree's smart bulb lags behind at least some of the competition is the color rendering score, which measures how accurately a given light source illuminates different shades. The Cree Connected LED hits a rather ordinary score of 80 out of 100, and given that both the WeMo LED and the equally inexpensive  GE Link LED  hit closer to 90, I'd have liked to see Cree do better.

To access the Cree LED's smart features, you'll need to pair it with a control hub that can translate its Zigbee signal into Wi-Fi. Like the GE Link LED, the Cree Connected LED came out the gate trumpeting Wink support at launch, but soon expanded its third party compatibility to include options like  SmartThings,  Staples Connect , and the  Philips Hue Bridge .

Different platforms offer different features -- SmartThings and Philips bring IFTTT support into the picture, for instance -- but in general, the automating experience is largely the same. We tested the bulb on multiple platforms, and never ran into any difficulties pairing it or controlling it.

Regardless of which platform you're using, you'll be able to turn the Cree Connected LED on or off remotely, dim it, or automate it using whatever controls your system offers. These likely include setting the lights to a timed schedule, or syncing them up with things like motion sensors.

The bulb paired easily with each of the above-mentioned platforms. Wink and SmartThings both have dedicated settings and pairing instructions for the Cree LED right in the app, which helps. Staples Connect doesn't offer device-specific support for Cree just yet, but it was able to detect the bulb as a generic Zigbee device on the first try.

Syncing the Cree LED with a Philips Hue setup was pretty painless, too, although I needed to manually reset the bulb during the pairing process in order to help the bridge find it. Doing so isn't tricky -- just turn the bulb on for 2 seconds, then off for 2 seconds a total of four times.

First things first: as a light bulb, the Cree Connected LED is perfectly decent. Even if you don't own a hub and don't plan on buying one quite yet, you could buy Cree's smart bulb, use it as a plain ol' dumb bulb, and -- for the most part -- be quite happy with it.

I say ""for the most part"" because of the bulb's dimming capabilities. The 4Flow LED that the Connected LED is modeled after worked very well with dimmer switches, and was capable of dialing the light up and down without flicker or buzz. Since they're more or less identical, you might expect that the Connected LED would follow suit.

Dimmer switch compatibility goes out the window, however, when bulbs come with smart dimming mechanisms of their own, and the Cree Connected LED is no exception. Try and dim it using a dimmer switch, and the two dimming mechanisms will clash, causing moderate to severe buzz and flicker. It's a minor concern given that the in-app dimming is smooth, simple and free of both flicker and buzz, but still, it's something to be aware of.

Despite compatibility with multiple platforms, Cree still prints pairing instructions with Wink right on the packaging. Connecting Cree's smart bulbs with the Wink app was an easy process: just tell the app you want to add a Cree Connected LED to your setup, then turn the bulb on when it tells you to. Pairing the bulbs worked on the first try in each and every one of my tests, and never took longer than a minute from start to finish. That's a great result, and also a relief, quite frankly. The GE Link LEDs I tested last year each took several attempts before they'd pair successfully, which got real frustrating real quick.

The one issue I did experience during the pairing process had nothing to do with the bulbs themselves, but instead, with the hub. Wink required me to update the hub to the newest firmware before it'd let me add Cree bulbs to my setup. Sounds simple enough, but it took several attempts on three different Wi-Fi networks before I could finally get the update to install correctly.

Once your Wink Hub is up to date and your bulbs are paired, the app experience is a good one. Basic control of the lights is intuitive -- just tap a bulb to turn it on or off, or swipe right or left to dim it up or down. Other platforms offer controls that are similar, if not borderline identical.

Automation is also pretty painless thanks to Wink's Robots feature, which does an excellent job of walking you through the process. You can set your lights to turn on or off whenever certain conditions are met -- arriving at home, or triggering a motion sensor, for instance. In my tests, the Robot automations worked perfectly as far as Cree's bulbs were concerned. I was especially happy to see the app do well with geofencing automations that detected when my phone entered or exited the area immediately around my apartment -- these types of automations didn't work out so well when I tested the  Quirky Aros Smart Air Conditioner  last year.

In addition to remote controls and Robot creation, you can create shortcuts -- saved presets for multiple lights and devices that you trigger all at once with a single tap. For instance, a ""Movie Mode"" shortcut might dim a number of lights down to a nice, low level for those late-night Netflix binges.

You can also schedule timed lighting changes, then view all of your scheduled automations in a handy calendar view. If you want to control multiple lights at once, you can group them together. Additionally, you can view an activity timeline for your whole system, and see who changed what, when.

As said earlier, you'll find similar controls on other platforms, too, and in my tests, Cree's LED always worked well. I did detect some occasional latency with automated lighting changes on Staples Connect, and experienced similar lag with the GE Link LED. Both bulbs aren't officially supported yet, but Zonoff tells me they're testing them now and expect to certify them soon. Once they do, expect the hub's code to be better optimized to eliminate those laggy automations.

Your other big-name control options are SmartThings and Philips Hue. Both bring IFTTT support into the conversation, and both boast open APIs and robust third-party compatibility. Like Staples Connect, SmartThings offers direct interaction with things like motion detectors, which for some might make it a more appealing pick than Philips Hue.

Cree's original LED  leapfrogged much of the competition when it debuted in the beginning of 2013, and now, the Cree Connected LED looks primed to follow suit. At $15 per bulb, it offers better value than the  Osram Lightify  and  Connected by TCP  starter kits, a much better value than  Belkin's WeMo LEDs  or the  Philips Hue Lux LEDs , and better performance than the equally affordable  GE Link LED , too.

You'll need a third-party hub in order to control the bulbs, but you've got a good range of options at this point, and Cree meshes well with all of them. Even if you aren't sold on the smart home yet, Cree's Connected LEDs only cost a few dollars more than non-connected competitors, and perform well even when you aren't putting their smarts to work. That makes buying now and automating later a reasonable approach, so long as your home doesn't use dimmer switches.

Smart lighting is one of the clearest inroads to wider smart home adoption. By focusing on wide third-party compatibility, strong ease of use, and a low price point, Cree's positioned its Connected LED to move the needle, just as the company did with LEDs at large back in 2013. Make no mistake -- this is the smart bulb to beat."

                D-Link Connected Home Hub
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/d-link-connected-home-hub/preview/|D-Link's new smart-home hub speaks Wi-Fi and Z-Wave|"

LAS VEGAS -- D-Link now has its own home automation hub, a Wi-Fi-and-Z-Wave-fluent device that's designed to plug into your router to bridge smart-home connectivity between various accessories and the Mydlink app.

This new device, dubbed the Connected Home Hub, is reasonably priced at 80 bucks, yet it doesn't understand as many protocol languages as competitors  Wink  and  SmartThings . Still, its compatibility with  AllSeen gives it a solid shot at a number of key smart-home integrations.

To kick off D-Link's foray into home automation, the team is unveiling a few specific Connected Home Hub-friendly products in tandem: a Z-Wave Open & Close Sensor (DCH-Z110), a Z-Wave Motion Sensor (DCH-Z120), a Wi-Fi Water Sensor (DCH-S160) and a Wi-Fi Siren (DCH-S220).

The Open & Close Sensor costs $40. As the name suggests, it's supposed to send you an alert whenever it senses that a door or window has been opened; D-Link claims that this battery-powered gizmo can last for as long as 3.5 years.

The battery-powered Motion Sensor comes in at $50 and is expected to last for up to two years. Like the Open & Close Sensor, the Motion Sensor is also designed to notify you whenever motion is detected. But this device also has built-in temperature and light sensors so you can track a couple of key environmental factors.

D-Link's $60 Wi-Fi Water Sensor plugs into a outlet and will send you an alert if it detects a leak. And, the $50 Wi-Fi Siren has six different alarm sounds and, like the other accessories, can be used as part of a custom rule in the Mydlink app.

All of these products, including the Connected Home Hub, will be available in the second quarter. Click here to see what else is happening at the 2015 International CES."

                Lime Green Labs Shade Light Switch
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/lime-green-labs-shade-light-switch/preview/|Shade brings learning software to a light switch|"

Shade wants to build a closer relationship between you and your light switch. As you use it, it learns your preferences for brightness and color and begins to automate the process by anticipating your needs. What's more, Shade promises that the switch's embedded photocells will even save energy (and you a few bucks) by adapting to ambient light and dimming the bulb when sunlight is strong.

Compatible with  Philips color changing LEDs  and regular dimmable bulbs, the Shade Light Switch installs over a standard switch box, both rocker-style and single pole. A simple dial hides the more advanced functionality underneath and gives the switch the familiar look of a standard dimming knob. Turn and push the dial for basic controls or use the iOS or Android apps to set and customize schedules over Wi-Fi.

The Kickstarter campaign supporting Shade launched on Tuesday. You'll get one dimmer for a pledge of $88 (which converts to about £56 in the UK and AU$101), a package of three costs $239 (£151 and AU$274) and there are sets of five and 10 dimmers available as well. Shade will ship anywhere in the world once it's ready. The hardware is still being prototyped, and the estimated delivery date isn't until August 2015.

Curiously, Lime Green Labs, the startup behind Shade, is offering Arduino boards and a download of the Arduino source code with several Kickstarter packages. Packages with just DIY instructions and no units will arrive as early as December. Thus, its software will be shippable eight months before the hardware is ready. It seems odd to offer DIY enthusiasts a way to craft a homemade Shade on their own without paying for the actual product.

Though I like that supporters have the option to do it themselves, I also wonder whether Shade is confident it can get the hardware right. The prototype shown in the Kickstarter video looks workable, but it is large. Lime Green Labs knows what it has in the software, and it's almost ready. Getting the hardware down to size so it can fit seamlessly into a wall switch will indeed be a difficult task.

The software's dimming feature does look cool. Either you set a preferred brightness level, or it learns through your usage and the photocells adjust to how bright you prefer your room to be. Then, it balances ambient light vs. bulb output to keep an even level. As mentioned, if more sunlight streams through the window, Shade will dim the lighting level accordingly. And if a cloud covers the sun, the switch should adjust again.

Shade also promises that you can manually turn the lights on or off, or adjust the lighting level without interrupting your scheduling in the future. Add in geolocation and the ability to learn color preferences with Philips Hue bulbs, and Shade's list of features becomes impressively long. I'm concerned, though, that Shade will be able to deliver on all of its goals. Though  Nest's thermostat  proved that learning technology can bring new life to old home features, the long list of variables that Shade hopes to control -- from brightness to color to automated schedules -- is a big challenge.

Once the initial model is released, Lime Green Labs is planning updates, including  IFTTT compatibility and the ability to share schedules across switches. Those are promising, but there's one more update I'd like to see. Though a single switch can control a bank of regular lights or a group of Hue bulbs, it can't yet adjust those Hue bulbs individually for true customization.

Despite a push for home automation, physical controls are making a comeback. Indeed, a common problem with smart products is their reliance on apps and the difficulty of syncing usage for multiple family members. Restricting physical interaction in exchange for digital controls becomes tedious when you have to tell someone not to flip a switch because it'll interfere with your automation.

Fixing that problem through both physical and app controls is the core of the light switch's appeal, but it's not the only product to do so. The  Wink Relay , another wall mounted switch takes a similar approach. It has customizable buttons and a touchscreen that can act as a central control panel to a setup of connected devices. It's more comprehensive than Shade, but it also costs $300 (and is only available in the US).

Its affordable price and learning capabilities make Shade unique in the field of lighting. It could act as a nice meeting point between different smart bulbs and standard bulbs throughout a house. If its software is as good as it says and if Lime Green Labs can get the hardware right, Shade looks to be an interesting next step in smart-bulb capabilities."

                Sylvania 100W Replacement Ultra LED
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/sylvania-100w-replacement-ultra-led/review/|Sylvania 100W Replacement Ultra LED review:|"

Two years ago, Sylvania was one of the first lighting manufacturers to bring a 100W replacement LED to market. The price? A mere $50.

Since then, the field has expanded, and prices have fallen significantly. Case in point: Sylvania's newest take on the 100W replacement LED, which retails at Lowe's for a much more reasonable $22. With the bulb's 1,600 lumen rating, you're getting a clear bump in brightness, but the 19W power draw is higher than I'd like, making it a less efficient choice than some of its competitors -- including bulbs that cost less. Some of those cheaper competitors also offer longer warranties, higher color rendering scores, and better compatibility with dimmers. Given all of that, I say stick with those alternatives, and pass on what Sylvania is offering.

Like most 100W replacement LEDs, Sylvania's bulb is a bit bulky, sporting an A21 shape (a step up in size from the traditional A19 shape you'll find with the majority of 60W bulbs). It's heavy, too, weighing in at 11.45 ounces.

That's heavier than any other 100W bulb we've tested -- more than twice as heavy as the GE Energy Smart 100W Replacement LED, the lightest bulb in this class. While not inherently problematic (unless you're buying a bulb for a weight-sensitive fixture), the extra bulk does perhaps speak to a design that's less economical than competitors that manage to do more with less.

All the same, Sylvania puts that hefty hardware to work, cranking out a sufficient 1,600 lumens of yellowy, 2,700 K light from a stated power draw of 19 watts. That's obviously quite efficient when compared with a 100W incandescent, but compared with competing LEDs, it's actually a bit underwhelming. Cree, GE, and Utilitech will all get you those same 1,600 lumens from a lower wattage. As for Philips, its 100W replacement offers a slightly higher 1,680 lumens from the same wattage as Sylvania.

Some of Sylvania's other specs fare a little better against the competition. For instance, we clocked the bulb's color rendering score at 83 out of 100, making it slightly better at accurate, vivid color illumination than all but one other 100W replacement (though it's worth noting that the Utilitech bulb that beat it costs $5 less).

The Sylvania LED promises the same 25,000-hour lifespan as most LEDs currently on the market, making it good for over twenty years if you're using it an average of three hours per day. Sylvania backs that longevity claim up with a warranty of five years -- plenty long enough for you to recoup the cost of the bulb in energy savings (and then some), but not as long as you'll get with Cree or GE, which both offer ten-year warranties on their 100W replacement LEDs. And again, both of those competitors cost less.

The big takeaway from all of these specs and figures is that there's nothing the Sylvania 100W replacement LED really excels at. It's the solid-C student of its class -- not flunking out, but not making the honor roll any time soon, either.

Taking Sylvania's LED out of our spectrometer rig and moving it to a more practical setting, I found the light perfectly pleasant and satisfyingly bright -- certainly a noticeable step up from what you'd expect with a 60W-level bulb, which would put out closer to 800 lumens.

However, the bulb isn't ideal for all home settings. With a non-omnidirectional design that doesn't cast very much downward light, you won't want to use it in a bedside table lamp, for instance. Omnidirectional bulbs like the Cree 100W Replacement LED (pictured above on the right) offer a much greater deal of flexibility with regards to where you can use them.

Though it doesn't say so anywhere on the packaging, Sylvania's LED is dimmable down to 10 percent of its maximum brightness. We tested it out on our dimming rig with Lutron and Leviton dimmer switches designed to work with LEDs, as well as an older triac rotary dial designed for incandescents only.

Sylvania's bulb dimmed successfully on all three, though it wasn't quite as smooth or flicker-free as some of the other bulbs I tested. The flicker was most visible at the lowest settings, although in fairness, it wasn't nearly as bad as what I saw with the  Utilitech 100W Equivalent LED . Regardless, if you're buying a bulb to use with a dimmer switch, you can do a lot better than both of them.

For $22, Sylvania's 100W Replacement Ultra LED isn't a bad bulb, and the price isn't unreasonable. Factoring in the long-term energy savings, it'd pay for itself in a little over two years -- well before the five-year warranty is expired.

Still, other 100W replacements will do the job just as well -- better, actually -- and they'll cost a little less. Philips' equally priced 100W replacement offers a slight uptick in brightness and efficiency, along with better dimming performance. Cree's well-rounded LED offers twice the warranty, as does the notably more efficient 100W replacement from GE -- both of those cost a few bucks less. Utilitech's 100W replacement, found next to Sylvania on the shelf at Lowe's, is even more of a bargain at just $17.

Sylvania doesn't hold a distinct edge over any of those bulbs, and that makes it a tough LED to recommend, if not an impossible one."

                Ecobee3 Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/ecobee3-wi-fi-smart-thermostat/|Ecobee3 Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat, HomeKit-enabled review:|"

Editors' note, June 10, 2016: This review has been updated with details on IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, and Apple HomeKit integrations.

Editors' note, November 19, 2014: Ecobee recently released version 1.1.1 of its Ecobee3 app and adjusted the sensitivity of its touchscreen. I have since retested the thermostat and the text and overall score have been updated accordingly.

Toronto-based Ecobee may not have the name recognition of  	Honeywell or Nest, but it was actually the first company to come out with an app-enabled thermostat. Its initial line of smart thermostats was funneled through dealers though, which limited the brand's ability to compete in the do-it-yourself arena.

To satisfy this new market, the company has rolled out the $249 Ecobee3 (£155/AU$285), a DIY climate kit comprised of a Wi-Fi thermostat and a remote temperature sensor that work with  	IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit and more.  It doesn't quite have the same design appeal as Nest, but the Ecobee3 is a thermostat I can wholeheartedly recommend.

Your installation  	success will vary a lot depending on your HVAC system and your level of electrical wiring savvy. The ideal will have a five-wire system, in which case you can literally just swap out your old thermostat for your new Ecobee3.

If your HVAC unit only has four wires running to your thermostat, you're not out of luck, but you will have an extra step to deal with. The Ecobee3 requires a C (or Common) wire connection, which you won't find on a four-wire HVAC system. To get around this problem, Ecobee includes something called a Power Extender Kit with your purchase free of charge that does the work of the C wire without you actually having to add that pesky fifth wire yourself (or having to call an electrician to do it for you).

You will need to know your way around your HVAC system to install the Extender Kit, since you need to connect it directly to the controller board on your HVAC unit, provided yours is new enough to have one. If not, you can still reconfigure the wiring, but budding DIYers will likely want to call in some experienced help. Whether you use the Extender Kit or not, this all seems unnecessary given that the competing   	Honeywell Lyric  and  Nest Learning Thermostat  will both work fine on a four-wire system.

For my own installation, I had to go with the rewire option given my near 20-year old HVAC unit. I had help from Steve Conaway, one of our technical editors, who rewired my unit to give it a C wire. It worked, but it certainly wasn't convenient.

Once the Ecobee3 was installed, it recognized the wires I connected and walked me through the configuration process. This included adding my home Wi-Fi details, selecting Fahrenheit or Celsius -- all of the stuff you'd expect from an initial thermostat setup. I also paired the included remote sensor to the thermostat, which took about a minute. The remote sensor is a handy extra that comes with the Ecobee3. It essentially acts as a standalone ambient indoor temperature monitor you can put in another room. It can also tell the thermostat whether you're home or away.

Registration is the final hurdle between connecting your thermostat to the Web and mobile apps and enjoying the full functionality of your Ecobee3. The early production versions of both were extremely glitchy, but I revisited them about 6 weeks after the original review date. The  displays looks the same, but the wonky usability issues are gone. That means that you can expect a much breezier registration process and interaction with the apps overall.

Visually, the Ecobee3 looks nice enough, with a touchscreen rather than the radial dials we've seen lately with the Lyric and the Nest. The homescreen displays the mode -- whether you're in cool, heat, auto or off -- the percentage of indoor humidity, the current indoor temperature, a temperature slider for manual tweaks, and quick access to settings, home and away mode updates and the local forecast. It also has a built-in motion sensor that helps the thermostat detect whether you're home or away.

Unfortunately, the touchscreen was much less responsive than I'd like. The ""return to homescreen"" button in the top left was particularly stubborn and took several tries to respond on more than one occasion. Fortunately, Ecobee has since made adjustments to the touchscreen sensitivity and it no longer takes multiple tries to get the buttons to work.

Moving beyond the early usability issues I encountered with the touchscreen and the apps, this thermostat actually performed quite well. It responded quickly and accurately when I adjusted the temperate in person and from the apps. I really liked that I could access the local forecast information easily from the thermostat's homescreen. And, the Smart Home/Away and Follow Me features present intriguing alternatives to the Lyric's glitchy geofencing home/away modes and the Nest's algorithm-based learning.

While I entered in a schedule that approximated my regular home and away settings, the Smart Home/Away feature transformed the Ecobee3 from a regular programmable thermostat into something smart and adaptable. Basically, it works like this: I programmed the thermostat to be set to Away mode between 8am and 6pm, but happened to return home for lunch one day. The thermostat and remote sensor's built-in motion and proximity detectors were able to detect that I was in fact home and automatically switched back to Home mode.

The Follow Me feature was similarly useful. Like Smart Home/Away, this option relies on the thermostat and remote sensor's built-in sensors to pinpoint your location and figure out when to kick on your heating and cooling system to make you as comfortable as possible. And Ecobee's Home IQ feature provides a breakdown of the energy and money you're saving with your shiny new smart thermostat, similar to Nest's monthly energy reports.

The Ecobee3 has an IFTTT channel and partnerships with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Wink, SmartThings, and a handful of other third-party products. Please note: The original Ecobee3 thermostat does not work with HomeKit. Instead, you will have to buy the second-gen HomeKit-enabled model for integration with Siri.

With IFTTT, you can create rules like, ""If the Ecobee3 switches to either Home or Away mode automatically, then send me a notification,"" or ""If your phone leaves a specified geofence range, then set my Ecobee3 to Away mode."" The Alexa and HomeKit integrations add voice control into the mix, so you can say,""Alexa/Siri, set my thermostat to 75 degrees."" The Wink and SmartThings integrations offer opportunities for the Ecobee3 to be part of a multi-protocol smart home system.

Given Nest's relationship to Google and Honeywell's history as a leader in the heating and cooling industry, these sorts of alliances are integral to Ecobee's success -- and the team has steadily added new ones in tandem with the growth of the smart home market.

Ecobee's $249 Ecobee3 smart thermostat has a lot to offer, even more so now since its early glitches have been fixed. So after a bit of a shaky start, the Ecobee3 is now well worth your consideration. It has all of the features you want from a thermostat plus add-ons like the remote sensor and the Power Extender Kit. Adding in partnerships like Alexa and HomeKit as well as its availability in Apple and Best Buy stores make the Ecobee3 a major competitor in the smart thermostat arena.

I still prefer the well-rounded Nest Learning Thermostat for its superior design and usability, and because you don't have to use a C wire (or a special workaround) for the installation, but the Ecobee3 is the best choice if you want Apple HomeKit integration and a remote sensor to track any room-to-room temperature disparities."

                GE Reveal BR30 LED
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/ge-reveal-br30-led/review/|GE Reveal BR30 LED review:|"

BR30-shaped floodlights cost more than regular light bulbs, and for directional track lighting and recessed lighting setups, the chances are good that you'll be buying more than one. That means you want to be sure and invest in a quality bulb that won't leave you disappointed.

In my opinion, that bulb is the GE Reveal BR30 LED -- and it isn't all that close. Along with a distinct uptick in color quality, the GE Reveal manages heat more effectively than the competition, and also works exceptionally well with dimmer switches, a pesky sore spot with the majority of bulbs we've tested.

Best of all, with a new price point of $18 at Home Depots nationwide (or less, if you live in a region that offers rebates for Energy Star-qualified bulbs), you're getting a terrific value on a bulb that's designed to last decades, and spending even less than you will for competitors like the  Cree BR30 LED , which we weren't as impressed with. If I needed to buy a floodlight for my home, there's no question that the GE Reveal BR30 LED is the one I'd go with.

The white-bodied GE Reveal BR30 LED looks simple enough, with the same silhouette as many of the sorts of existing floodlights you might be using it to replace. Aside from the blue band at the base of the bulb, it looks no different than GE's standard BR30 LED.

Like all BR30s, the GE Reveal is designed to spread light in a single direction, unlike the omnidirectional light that you'll get with most common  	 A19 shaped bulbs. The ""BR"" in BR30 stands for bulging reflector, which simply means that any light shining at a downward angle gets reflected back up and out through the top of the bulb. This makes it the ideal bulb shape for recessed lighting setups, and for things like overhead track lighting, as well.

Like other GE Reveal bulbs, the GE Reveal BR30 LED sets itself apart from the competition with a focus on color quality that comes thanks to a design that filters out excess yellow tones. This gives it a color rendering score that's about ten points higher than the bulbs that sit next to it on the shelf -- and that means it'll make the colors in your home look more vivid and accurate.

Of course, while filtering out some of the light will improve color quality, it comes at an expense of brightness. The GE Reveal BR30 LED compensates for this by upping the wattage to get that brightness back up where it should be. This makes for a light that's slightly less efficient than other LEDs.

This is a different approach than GE has taken previously. The original, A19-shaped GE Reveal LED failed to increase the wattage, making it noticeably dimmer than competitors like the  	 Cree TW Series LED , which also promises superior color rendering capabilities. That kept me from giving it a full-throated recommendation  when I tested the two bulbs out earlier this year.

As said, the GE Reveal BR30 LED doesn't make that same mistake. With 12 watts compared to the 9 or 10 that a BR30 LED will typically draw, it will cost a few extra cents per year to use the thing, but that's quite literally a small price to pay for higher color quality. It's still highly efficient compared to the 65W incandescents it's designed to replace -- make the switch, and you'll still save an average of $6.50 in energy costs each year.

At any rate, those few extra watts in the GE Reveal keep the brightness up where you want it, which seems worth it to me. A 65W-replacement BR30 should put out at least 600 lumens, and the GE Reveal puts out 630. In our tests, we actually found that number to be a bit conservative, with our spectrometer clocking the bulb's light output at closer to 700 lumens.

Another consideration when it comes to brightness is how well a given bulb will work on a dimmer switch. Many dimmer switches will generate electromagnetic interference that causes bulbs to flicker and buzz -- and some bulbs are more susceptible than others.

The BR30 LEDs that we tested out gave us even more trouble than  the 60W replacement LEDs we tested earlier this year, with a great deal of buzz and flicker as we dialed the light levels up and down, even on dimmer switches designed specifically for use with LEDs.

However, the one exception was the GE Reveal BR30 LED. While the bulb buzzed very faintly as we dimmed it, we didn't see a noticeable flicker on any of the dimmer switches we tested out, not even on an outdated rotary dial designed for incandescent use only.

The picture above is actually an animated GIF of the GE Reveal plugged into a Leviton dimmer switch and dimmed down to fifty percent, the point at which bulbs tend to flicker the most. As you can see, the light level remains constant throughout each frame.  No other BR30 we tested came anywhere close to performance that steady.

In addition to flicker, we made sure to examine each bulb's dimmable range. All the way up, you want your bulb to shine at 100 percent of its normal brightness. At the bottom, you want to be able to get as close to zero as possible before it cuts to black.

As you can see, the GE Reveal dimmed down to just 5 percent before turning off, which was a good result, but not as low as either of the Philips bulbs we tested out. Still, unlike the GE Reveal and Cree BR30s, neither of those two bulbs dimmed all the way up to full brightness on our switches, which seems more important to me.

The main claim of the entire GE Reveal product line is that they'll render colors better than the competition. The question is whether or not it's a noticeable difference.

To find out, we set the GE Reveal in front of our spectrometer, a handy gizmo that lets us measure things like brightness, color temperature, and color-rendering scores. Most BR30 LEDs have a color rendering score around 80, but in the GE Reveal's case, that score came in just under 90. That's the same type of score as you'll see with the kinds of lights used for things like art exhibition and professional photography.

To put this score to the test, we set up a colorful milieu of fruits, flowers, and candy. With our camera's exposure settings locked in, we lit each setup with each of the BR30 LEDs we had on hand, taking photos for comparison.

In each of these tests, the GE Reveal stood out, with our producer and photographer Colin West McDonald telling me it was without question the bulb he'd want lighting his home studio. If you feel like judging for yourself, we've packed each and every shot from our BR30 color quality tests into  a handy slideshow.

The GE Reveal also excelled in our heat management tests. Unlike other types of light bulbs, LEDs will see a slight decline in performance as they heat up, just like your cell phone or your laptop. In practical terms, this means that they'll lose a bit of brightness in the first thirty minutes or so of use, then level off at what manufacturers call the ""steady state."" This steady state is where they get rated for things like brightness and efficiency, so you don't have to worry about getting short-changed on the stated specs.

A higher steady state is indicative of a bulb that does a better job with managing heat, and in the GE Reveal BR30 LED's case, it does a better job than any other bulb we've tested so far. In the graph above, that purple line represents the GE Reveal, and as you can see, it levels off after 30 minutes or so at roughly 95 percent of its initial brightness. That's a terrific result, and one that helps it outshine the competition.

The GE Reveal BR30 LED is an outstanding floodlight, and at its new price point of $18, it's an outstanding value, too. It was the unquestioned winner when we tested for color quality, heat management, and dimming performance, and it comes backed with the same 10-year warranty as the  Cree BR30 LED , which costs $2 more per bulb.

If you're looking for strictly the cheapest LED floodlight that offers acceptable performance (and if you aren't using dimmer switches), then the $13  Philips SlimStyle BR30 LED  probably merits consideration. Beyond that, I can't think of a reason why I'd recommend any BR30 over the GE Reveal. For long-term lighting that you'll love living with, it's a well-deserved Editors' Choice."

                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/emberlight/preview/|Emberlight offers BYOB smart lighting (bring your own bulb, that is)|"

Smart lighting certainly has a lot of appeal, but what if you've already invested in non-smart bulbs that promise to last decades? San Francisco-based startup Emberlight thinks it has the solution, with a brainy adapter that promises to smarten up your existing stock of light bulbs.

Essentially, Emberlight is a smart bulb without the bulb. You screw it in, then screw in whatever bulb you want -- LED, CFL, halogen, you name it. Emberlight takes it from there, offering smart scheduling, proximity detection, and full automation controls through direct Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE connections with your Android or iOS device -- no hub necessary.

Emberlight is seeking its capital through Kickstarter, where the campaign has already surpassed its $50,000 goal despite still having well over a month left on the clock. Emberlight's suggested retail price is $60, which converts to roughly £35, or AU$65 (orders outside of the US will need to tack on an additional $15 for shipping). At launch, Emberlight will only be available in Edison 26/27 screw base configurations, but down-light and bayonet-style models are said to be on the way, as well. And it's designed to work with the various main voltages and frequencies in use around the world.

That isn't an insignificant price tag -- especially if you're planning on outfitting multiple lights in your home. Still, there's an awful lot to like about the notion of adding a la carte smarts to existing light bulbs.

One obvious benefit is that by keeping the bulb separate from the smarts, you won't need to throw out (and replace) that smart hardware just because the bulb breaks or burns out. The fact that you'll be able to add smarts to the specific bulb of your choosing is another nice perk, and likely music to the ears of anyone who's picky about the look of their lights.

That said, Emberlight looks like it'll add a good inch or so to the length of your bulb, which might keep it from fitting into tight fixtures. Even if the bulb does fit, there's a good chance that it'll stick out more noticeably than before, which seems like the sort of thing some consumers might find irritating.

Emberlight is scheduled to ship out to Kickstarter backers in February 2015. If you don't feel like waiting that long, consider checking out the  Connected by TCP Wireless LED Kit  or the newly announced  GE Link LEDs , two relatively inexpensive smart-lighting options."

                Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor, Outdoor
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/koubachi-wi-fi-plant-sensor-outdoor/review/|Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor review:|"

The Swiss company Koubachi AG hopes to use its scientific prowess to craft new innovation for the smart home. It began by targeting plants and developing a free application to help you care for your household garden.  Now, they have a connected plant sensor to go along with the app.  You can purchase the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor as either an indoor unit or a hardier outdoor version for $99 or $129 (£80/AU$150), respectively.  Other than the price tag and some added rain resistance, both models are exactly the same.  They measure moisture, light, and temperature from the soil near your plant, and use that information along with the compiled knowledge of their Plant Care Engine to tell you exactly how to make your garden flourish.

Given that the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor measures almost as many categories of data as the  Parrot Flower Power  and boasts a range similar to  Oso Technologies' PlantLink , I had high hopes that it would be the perfect plant guardian.  It even has the most helpful database of the three, and since it's the most expensive, the high expectations felt warranted.  Unfortunately, lack of specificity when it comes to data, extremely slow recommendations, and a smaller upgrade from its free app than the price point should warrant keep the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor from reaching its full potential.  Patient gardeners looking for the most hands-off care on the market should consider the Koubachi.  However, there are plenty of cheaper options that require just a little more effort.  For instance, the PlantLink offers comparable monitoring for only $79, and Koubachi's own app, with just a little more time invested at setup, will freely offer care recommendations that are just as helpful as those you'd get by paying for the sensor.

The Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor requires no separate hub hardware to connect to your Wi-Fi network.  Both the indoor and the outdoor versions have a sleek, white head wrapped in a black stripe with a long gray tail.  A single black button dots the top of its dome.  Stick the tail in the soil by your plant and hold the button down to start the configuration.  A light above the button glows orange, signaling that it's ready, after which you can use Koubachi's iOS app or any Internet-enabled device to sync your sensor with any Wi-Fi router in range.  Koubachi has an Android app as well, but it can't help you configure your sensor yet.

You can purchase either version of the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor on Amazon or on Koubachi's website.  For an extra $30, the outdoor version buffs up its rain resistance, but both can stand a splash or two as you water your plants.

The online capabilities that go along with the physical device are quite user-friendly.  Koubachi uses pictures and step-by-step instructions to guide you through the initial process of getting your sensor to talk with your router.  The directions are simple and Koubachi makes them easy to follow.  The Koubachi database will even sense an error should something go wrong, and will walk you through troubleshooting automatically.  All told, to remove the sensor from the box, insert the two included AA batteries (which Koubachi claims will last for more than a year), and sync it with my Wi-Fi, I needed about 5 minutes.

Of course, you'll also need to tell Koubachi about the plant you're monitoring.  You can search Koubachi's database for a match in a number of ways.  On iOS apps, it has introduced a beta program called Plant Finder.  This fantastic guide walks you through identifying your plant one question at a time.  If you have no idea what kind of plant you're dealing with, this is the most user-friendly plant identification software I've come across.  Plant Finder will offer options about the shape of the leaves, the position of the stem, even the location of purchase, and you can pick from the provided pictures whenever you see a match or skip the question when you're stumped.  The database will use any responses you give it to make a guess at your plant type, and will show you pictures to help you decide if it has the right one.  If not, you can keep right on going through the questions.

Plant Finder is awesome.  Unfortunately, it's not yet available for the Android app.  You'll have to search this version of the app for the common or scientific name of your plant.  The website provides a little more guidance, as you have stem and leaf criteria to help you narrow the options if you want to scroll through pictures.

All versions of the database, even Android's, best the competition when it comes to how helpful they are at finding your plant.  However, Koubachi's number of plants to pick from comes in dead last by a wide margin compared with the databases of Parrot and Oso Technologies. Koubachi has around 800 plants to pick from, whereas Parrot and Oso have thousands.

With Plant Finder, Koubachi almost makes identifying your plant fun.  I felt like a detective, using questions and pictures as clues as I drew closer and closer to finding my suspect.  But if your plant is at all unusual, the database won't have it, and you'll be stuck with the letdown of an unsolved mystery.

Given Koubachi AG's pedigree, this lack of depth puzzles me. It has been developing the Plant Care Engine at the heart of its database since it launched its app more than three years ago.  The information it uses comes from the prestigious Swiss university, ETH Zurich.  Perhaps the amount of detail it gathers for each plant it adds slows its progress, but Parrot's database is just as detailed and much deeper.

If you don't find your plant, Koubachi will offer alternatives to pick from that have similar criteria, but you'll want to use an outside resource to make sure the care advice you're getting for this alternate plant is similar to what your actual plant needs.  Koubachi's price point is high, but its database is free, so your best bet is to check if it has your plant before you make your purchase.

To ease the cost, you can scale Koubachi's system by using the same sensor on multiple plants, but if you want live monitoring in multiple places, Koubachi lacks a way to cheaply add units.  The PlantLink, by Oso Technologies, makes scaling your system with additional Links easy.  Initially, at $79, it costs almost as much as Koubachi's $99 indoor version, since you have to purchase a Basestation to connect your Links.  However, you can purchase additional Links for $35 and add them to the same system.  Here, Koubachi's standalone nature works against it. Thus, if you want to monitor a variety of plants simultaneously, Koubachi's price necessitates that you look elsewhere.

The appearance of the device also sticks out more than the competitors.  Parrot's aesthetic is the most appealing.  Its branchlike shape can fit into almost any garden decor.  PlantLink's small, white sensor is easy to hide.  The Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor looks like a one-eyed robot.  It's distracting, and because it needs to be placed outside of the shade of the branches of your plant so it can accurately judge light conditions, the Koubachi sensor is impossible to hide.  Make sure you take a close look at the pictures before you make your purchase.  If you decide on the Koubachi, every time you look at your plant, you'll see this cyclops of a sensor looking back.

Once the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor is keeping its watchful eye on your garden, it will begin gathering information on soil moisture, ambient temperature, and ambient light.  It sends that information to the cloud, where Koubachi's Plant Care Engine interprets the readings and gives you advice to best care for your specific plant.

The recommendations are specific without being precise.  After Koubachi's cloud processes the readings from your sensor, you'll be told you need to water your plant, or that your plant has enough water.  You might be told to find a sunnier spot or a warmer spot for it.  The Plant Care Engine will even give you advice about fertilizer and misting, simply based on its knowledge of your plant.

Koubachi will also tell you exactly how to water, in great detail.  For my plant, I needed to use room temperature water and add enough so that it dripped through to the saucer.  After 15 minutes, I removed the excess from the saucer.  I found Koubachi's recommendations to be the easiest to follow of the smart sensors I've tested.

However, the sensor doesn't provide precise data.  It won't tell you how much sunlight or water your plant needs.  That said, nothing on the market will, and Koubachi gives you enough information so that you can easily figure it out.  The watering recommendations give a fairly good idea of how much to water and when to stop.

For sunlight and temperature, you can compare the advice to the information on your plant in Koubachi's database.  The sensor told me my cactus had too much shade.  I could see on the graph that over the course of the week, my cactus only had partial shade during the sunniest times of the day.  Unfortunately, the graph itself won't show the ideal range by comparison, but at least it uses the same language as the database.  Since the database revealed that my cactus preferred full sunlight, I was able to figure out exactly what ""a sunnier spot"" meant for my plant.  Knowing your plant's preferences as far as temperature range and sunlight makes it easy to use the recommendations and the collected information to figure out exactly what you need to do to care for your plant.

You can also see live data by pressing the button on the sensor.  This handy feature lets you see immediate readings for moisture, sunlight, and temperature.  Thus, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor does take exact measurements, so I'm not sure why it doesn't let you see them on the long-term charts as well.

If you're studying the conditions of your garden over time, you'll want to look elsewhere.  Koubachi's storage is only temporary, you can't see exact points on the collected data graphs, they don't show up on the apps, and there's no way to download them and collect the data yourself.

Koubachi has promised this increased precision in its upcoming ""pro"" version. Given that the Parrot Flower Power already tracks and stores data well, Koubachi has some catching up to do, and no price info is available yet for this upgraded model.

Though it's not the device for dataphiles or citizen scientists, Koubachi's easy-to-understand recommendations across all important plant care categories make it a great all-in-one garden guardian for those who need help keeping their plants alive long-term.

Again, it tracks moisture, sunlight, and temperature, and makes recommendations for each of those as well as fertilizer and misting.  Additionally, a single sensor can give advice for multiple plants.  Leave it with a plant long enough, and it will learn the moisture cycle and continue giving you advice after you've moved your sensor to another spot.  In this way, it is possible to cheaply scale the Koubachi system, but it takes a while.

In fact, just about everything with Koubachi takes a while; even the live readings are slow to react to spikes.  For instance, when I watered my plant or put it in the fridge to shift the temperature, the sensor would take hours to fully update to the new conditions.

The recommendations, though thorough and helpful, take even longer.  You'll have to wait a day for watering recommendations, three days for temperature recommendations, and seven for lighting recommendations.  This pace might be deliberate, but it still requires patience to operate.  That said, by the time it bestows its advice, it understands the cycles of your plant's environment better than any other plant sensor out there.

Therefore, if you want the Koubachi to help you plan the watering cycle of several household plants, plan for it to take weeks for each one.  It needs to process a full watering cycle before it'll remember enough to give you advice about when to water in the future.  Thus, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor functions more like a wise old sage than a nimble and reactive protector.

Once it knows, though, it can send you fully customizable reminders and alerts.  I let one of my plants dry out, and sure enough, the email came through, reminding me that I needed to water the bamboo I affectionately named ""Planty.""  The emails are cut and dried, but they serve the purpose, and as I continued to let the pot dry out, they kept coming.  They arrived daily until I watered Planty, counting up with each passing day to politely add a level of urgency to the task as the number grew.

The slowness of the readings meant I still received a reminder email a few hours after I watered my plant, so you'll need to be careful with communication if you have multiple people responsible for taking care of your garden.  The sensor's lack of responsiveness will make it easy to get wires crossed, but you can help avoid confusion by simply telling the system after you've given your plant water.

Of course, once you've placed the sensor elsewhere, you'll need to tell the database when you've watered the plants not currently being monitored so it can stay up to date on the moisture cycle, and as long as you do that, you'll keep getting accurate reminder emails from unmonitored plants as well.

In fact, with just a little extra effort, you can get moisture, fertilizer, and misting recommendations without the sensor at all.  The fertilizer and misting recommendations are automatic.  To add moisture recommendations for an unmonitored plant, you'll go through the same process of telling the application about your plant, naming it, and telling it the location.  Then, you'll water it, and follow the system's instructions for checking on the soil moisture daily.  Each day during this initial calibration, you'll report back on whether the soil has dried out yet.  Once it does, Koubachi will remember that time frame and will send you reminders to help keep that unmonitored plant alive as well.

Koubachi's ability to help with unmonitored plants puts the usefulness of its app well ahead of the competition.  The information it keeps on the plants in its database is specific and helpful.  It's easy to understand which plants will survive best in the conditions of your home just from looking through the available choices and what helps them flourish.  You can view all of your plants, monitored or not, from a single, aesthetically pleasing screen, where you can check on the recommendations for each.

The Koubachi system takes awhile to get up and running, but once it does, this day to day functionality is fantastic.  The Plant Care Engine and the app it runs is so good, actually, that it calls into question the need for the device at all.

Again, the free app comes with all of Koubachi's Plant Care Engine information.  The Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor costs $129 for the outdoor version and $99 for the less water-resistant indoor version.  Since it doesn't track long-term data that well, the sensor is only useful as a plant guardian.  Without the sensor, the app will tell you about fertilizer and misting, and you can configure moisture recommendations yourself.  The sensor monitors moisture for you, and adds temperature and light readings.

However, you'll need to compare the temperature and light readings to the database anyway to make sure you're correctly following the recommendations, and the database will tell you the temperature range and sunlight preferences of your plant, with or without the sensor.  Thus, by calibrating the moisture and checking the sunlight and temperature yourself, you can use Koubachi's free app to figure out all of the recommendations offered by the $129 sensor.

Not to mention, if you're monitoring an outdoor space, you might not be able to control the temperature or ambient light.  Meaning, the two primary functions added by the sensor will be giving you recommendations for things beyond your control.

Again, if you want to be hands-off with your plant care and are willing to pay for that privilege, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor is a great garden guardian.  However, there are many options out there that can monitor your plants as effectively in exchange for a little extra effort on your part, and one of those options is Koubachi's own Web-based application.

Fortunately, in our performance tests, Koubachi's sensor proved accurate enough to be helpful.  Again, this is not a precise collector of data, and its readings reflect that, but it always stays within a close enough margin of error so it can make viable recommendations to keep your plants alive.

To test the accuracy of the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor, we placed it in a pot with a ponytail palm and compared its readings over the course of a month with those of a separate, calibrated meter.

Here are the results:

Across all categories, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor was obviously detecting the same spikes and dips as our calibrated meter. Part of the reason it lacks precision is due to the way it measures. For instance, most moisture meters check the percent of soil moisture with 0 percent indicating dry and 100 percent indicating completely saturated. Koubachi measures on a plant-by-plant scale. 0 percent is still dry, but 100 percent indicates your plant has all of the water it needs. It's a smaller scale, since your plant will inevitably register Koubachi's 100 percent rating sooner than complete saturation. We converted the units for the sake of the comparison, but Koubachi's broad-stroke approach still left it lacking in accuracy. As a result, in tests comparing this measurement to the other plant sensors we've tested, Koubachi performs the worst.

However, Koubachi does it this way to increase the helpfulness of its recommendations. Instead of looking at an independent percentage, it's showing you exactly how close you are to your plant's sweet spot. Its dedication to being user-friendly does cost its accuracy. The range it's working with is smaller, so it's going to be less precise, but it does stay within a reasonable margin of error for keeping your plant alive.  Thus, Koubachi's performance maintains its status as a lousy data collector and a fine garden advisor.

If you're interested in bringing Smart Home connectivity to the garden, Koubachi AG can help you do it.  For $129 and $99 for the respective outdoor and indoor varieties, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor is the most expensive and most comprehensive device you can use to give your plant a voice.  Though the database this sensor connects to is limited in number of plants, if it has yours, you can expect to be guided through the most thorough and helpful online experience available as well.  Whether you want to check on your plants with your computer, your Android device, or your iOS device, Koubachi has you covered.

That said, if you're interested in rescuing a plant or collecting data, the  Parrot Flower Power  is faster, cheaper, and more precise.  If you simply need to monitor moisture levels and want a long range and easily scalable system to help you do that, go with  Oso Technologies' PlantLink .  Nevertheless, the Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor has a longer range than Parrot, and advises on everything, unlike PlantLink.  Thus, if you want the most hands-off and comprehensive device and are willing to pay for it, consider the Koubachi.  To help make your decision, start off with their free application.  That'll do most of the work for you anyway, and if you like it, but wish the process was a little more automated, the sensor might be worth your while."

                Cree T8 LED
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/cree-t8-led/preview/|Cree's new T8 LED sets its sights on the commercial sector|"

LED lighting looks to be the emerging standard for the post-incandescent age -- but you wouldn't know it from looking at the commercial sector, where linear fluorescent lighting still reigns supreme. With over 2 billion fluorescent sockets running hot for business hours and beyond, these kinds of bulbs account for 42 percent of all lighting electricity consumed, per the US Department of Energy.

That's a lot of lights, and upstart LED manufacturer Cree wants to get in on the action with its new T8 LED, a tubular bulb designed to fit into 90 percent of existing T-8 fluorescent ballasts -- no rewiring necessary.

Cree's T8 LED uses 21 watts to produce 2,100 lumens' worth of light at a color temperature of 3,500K or 4,000K, and it's rated to last 50,000 hours. On top of all that, it boasts an impressive CRI (color rendering index) of 90. Compared with buzzy, flickering fluorescents -- which aren't as efficient and don't last as long -- Cree's LED looks like an obvious upgrade. Chuck Swoboda, Cree's chairman and CEO, goes as far as saying, ""There's no reason to install another linear fluorescent tube again.""

I'm betting that plenty of businesses will beg to differ. At $30 per bulb, Cree's T8 LED is dramatically more expensive than comparable T-8 fluorescents, which can retail for less than $2 each when bought in bulk. Even with the lower energy consumption, it would still take about a decade or more for Cree's T8 LED to make up that kind of price difference.

The real target of these LEDs might be business owners operating in regions that offer significant energy rebates for the adoption of high-efficiency lighting. The T8 LED was recently added to the DesignLights Consortium's list of qualified products, which rates commercial lighting in the same way that Energy Star rates residential lighting. That should qualify it for rebates ranging from $2 to $15 per bulb in participating regions, potentially making the T8 LED a much more appealing investment.

Rebates aside, business owners might still be drawn to Cree's T8 LED for its longer life span, as well as the fact that, unlike fluorescents, it contains no mercury. The T8 LED also promises to turn on instantly, and Cree claims it's compatible with most dimmable ballasts, too.

The T8 LED is available now in the US and Canada through Cree's distribution network, and comes with a 5-year warranty, which is a step down from the 10-year warranty found on Cree's residential bulbs, like its   popular 60W replacement LED . Consumers and business owners seeking more information on the specific energy rebates offered in their region can check out the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE)."

                Belkin WeMo Smart LED Bulbs
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/belkin-wemo-smart-led-bulbs/preview/|Smart LED Bulbs join Belkin's WeMo lineup|"

Belkin is adding LED bulbs to their rapidly expanding WeMo family of smart devices, the company announced today at CES.

The Belkin WeMo Smart LED Bulb is an 800 lumen 60-watt replacement that you'll be able to control remotely on Android and iOS devices using the free WeMo app. Each bulb features a warm white color temperature of 3000K along with a lifespan of 25,000 hours. You'll be able to automate the bulbs to turn on and off at certain times, or trigger them with another WeMo device, like a motion detector.

Like the light switches and plug-in modules that already bear the WeMo name, the WeMo Smart LED Bulbs will be fully compatible with the free web service IFTTT, which allows them to be triggered using nifty things like iOS location and Foursquare check-ins.

Unlike other WeMo devices, however, you'll need a separate accessory -- the ""WeMo Link"" plug-in hub -- in order to use them. That means you can't simply buy a $39 bulb and start automating it right out of the box -- you'll need to purchase the two-bulb WeMo LED Lighting Starter Set for $129, which comes with the WeMo Link.

Still, the only other bulb that's directly automatable through IFTTT is the Philips Hue, with a starter kit that costs $199. If you're interested in IFTTT-controlled lighting (and not so interested in bulbs that change colors on demand), then the Belkin bulb is probably pretty intriguing. If IFTTT doesn't tempt you, and simple automations will do just fine, then you'll probably want to consider the Connected by TCP Wireless LED Lighting Kit, which offers three automatable LEDs, yet costs $20 less than Belkin's kit."

                Viper Home
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/viper-home/review/|Viper Home review:|"

Viper is a Directed Electronics brand that makes all sorts of car-related gadgets. Recently, though, the company added a DIY home security system to the mix. That means that this new $229.99 system, dubbed Viper Home, is competing against similar products like the $349.99 Oplink Security TripleShield, $199 iSmartAlarm, $199 Canary Smart Home Security Device, and $239 Piper.

The Canary and Piper are all-in-one hubs with built-in cameras. The Oplink and iSmartAlarm, on the other hand, have hubs and separate accessories like door/window sensors and motion detectors. Viper definitely designed its home security system in the style of Oplink and iSmartAlarm. But Viper Home offers something that none of the others can -- optional integration with existing Viper vehicle security products.

Not only that, but you can buy extras like cameras and sirens a la carte and if you get a Z-Wave bridge, you can broaden the functionality of your Viper Home kit to include home automation. So, not only does Viper Home offer DIY home security, you can also incorporate vehicle security and automatable appliances -- if you so desire. That's why I think Viper Home is the most well-rounded option available among DIY security systems today.



I would recommend this system if you plan to invest in more than just the starter kit. Since iSmartAlarm is less expensive and offers roughly the same functionality, there isn't a great reason to get Viper Home instead. But, if you do plan to upgrade in any way, I wouldn't recommend iSmartAlarm or Oplink: iSmartAlarm's camera didn't do very well during our testing and Oplink's camera comes with a $19.99 monthly fee. Viper Home will cost you just $9.99 a month.

So, over time, Viper would be less expensive than Oplink and it offers a wider range of optional features. It's a particularly great option if you're interested in Viper's vehicle security offerings (or already have a Viper car security system). And if you don't care about the vehicle security options, but do want good-quality video streaming, Viper Home is $10 less a month than Oplink. If you don't want a camera or car monitoring, iSmartAlarm is still the best value around.

Design, usability, and features It seems like Viper Home paid more attention to design than Oplink or iSmartAlarm. Yes, all three are glossy white gadgets, but there's something about the Viper devices that stands out to me. And by stand out, I mean that they will blend in better with your surroundings. The hub, sensors, motion detectors, sirens, and cameras are small and carefully designed to maintain a sophisticated, yet inconspicuous presence in your home. Each item looks nice alone and blends in well with the other products. There aren't any colorful logos messing with the flow like the Oplink system or oddly inconsistent design like iSmartAlarm's line of products -- the hub is square, the sensors are squarish, and the camera is rounded -- why?

In the basic $229.99 starter kit you get a hub, a motion sensor, and a door/window sensor, along with the requisite batteries, power cord, and Ethernet cable you need to install the thing. The setup process really was painless. The hub connects directly to your router via the provided Ethernet cable and then you have to register your security system.

Next you find a good spot for the door/window sensor and the motion detector. They're equipped with adhesive strips, so that's about as simple as possible. Just find a good place in your house and stick 'em where you want (the guide offers suggestions for optimal performance). The sides of the door/window sensor should be three-quarters of an inch or closer to one another. Keep the motion detector out of direct sunlight and put it at least 72 inches off the floor. If you have a hard time reaching that high, that will likely be the biggest inconvenience you will face during this installation.

Now, it's time to download the app -- also simple. It's free and it's currently available for both Android and iOS users. Just use the log-in you created during registration and you can access the Viper Connect app. For all of the available options offered through Viper Connect, the app is incredibly straightforward and well-designed. To access the home security portion, select Home Control.

From there, you can choose among the following: Arm Away, Disarm, Arm Stay, and Panic. There's also a Status section in the bottom right corner so you can see what setting you're currently using. The Panic button won't call the police, it will actually send notifications to emergency contacts you specifically add to the system. In fact, Viper Home is not designed to contact the authorities at all. It simply lets you know when a ""security event"" occurs and then you decide how to respond. If there is a security breach of any kind, though, you will receive an e-mail sent to the address you used during registration and a notification from the app.



If you add in other features like the $149.99 camera/motion sensor, the $49.99 siren or additional door/window sensors and motion detectors you can do even more. With the camera and the $9.99 monthly fee, for example, you will receive live video alerts during security violations. And don't forget the home automation possibilities available with the addition of a Z-Wave bridge. That way, you can control a whole bunch of different home appliances from the same Viper Connect app.

Viper Home can support up to 32 users and up to 64 different devices. And the app has a history section where you can view the dates and times of specific security events and filter by user. It's easy and there are so many ways to make it work for your lifestyle.

Performance I installed the starter kit, a siren, and a camera at home. I had no issues with the system during testing -- no false alarms or inconsistent notifications to note. Every time I triggered a security event, Viper Home responded as expected.

Basically, this meant that I got to spend a lot of time trying to stealthily get past the motion detector unnoticed and open and close the window to test the sensor. Every time I got near the motion detector when the system was armed, I received an e-mail and a notification. Same goes for the door/window sensor. The camera, too, doubles as a motion detector and it absolutely refused to let me sneak into my own living room (no matter how hard I tried).

I guess it makes sense, since the motion sensors have a detection range of 39.4 feet. Also important: the siren was loud. Apparently, it can go up to 85dBA for a minute and a half after an intrusion is noted. It's surely loud enough to scare away a skittish thief.

Conclusion I am extremely happy with Viper Home. It looks good, it's easy to use, it offers a lot of features, and it works. If you are interested in a DIY security system, Viper Home is a solid competitor.

If you really care about design, the Viper Home starter kit might even be worth the extra $30 over Oplink or iSmartAlarm -- whether or not you plan to upgrade. It also depends on what sort of system suits your needs. Piper and Canary are both intriguing design-focused options. The all-in-one system is definitely more subtle and it comes with a camera to capture footage of intruders.

I can't think of any reason you should get Oplink over Viper Home. Oplink's monthly fee is $10 more and it doesn't offer anything extra that justifies the price hike. So if you do want a camera that works and will offer live streaming, Viper Home is the best bet. And, if you're interested in a security system for your home and your car, Viper vehicle security and remote start options are accessible on the same Viper Connect app. There's something appealing about having all of your security needs efficiently condensed into a single, well-designed app."

                Insteon Starter Kit
                            "|https://www.cnet.com/products/insteon-starter-kit/review/|Insteon Starter Kit review:|"

At the time of this review's publication, the reviewer was unaware of the conditional automation possible by linking a motion detector to a ""scene"" of linked devices. The Insteon Hub's app is capable of automating lights to turn on or off when motion is detected, as our readers have pointed out, and the review has been adjusted accordingly. This feature is only available through the purchase of the motion detector hardware, which is not included in the Insteon Starter Kit base package.

If you're looking for a start in home automation that's free from fuss -- and, more importantly, free from monthly fees -- then you might want to consider the Insteon Starter Kit, available for $119 exclusively at Best Buy. Insteon claims that with its line of automation products and its free smartphone app, ""your home is with you wherever you go.""

You should temper your expectations here, as the Starter Kit, with its two LampLinc dimmers and the router-esque Insteon Hub, will only allow you to automate a pair of lamps. Automating just two lamps is a tad underwhelming. The important thing is that with the Insteon Hub, you'll have a sturdy home automation foundation to build upon. Add the Insteon Thermostat to your system, for instance, and you'll be able to control the temperature of your home remotely. Add an Insteon Motion Sensor or perhaps an Open/Close Sensor for your front door, and you'll be able to receive alerts whenever someone's moving through your home. With the Insteon Leak Sensor, you'll be able to detect minor drips before they become major catastrophes. While all of these devices are all sold separately from the Starter Kit, Insteon won't ever charge you a monthly fee to automate them, no matter how many of them you add to your network.

The real downside is that unlike newer automation systems such as WeMo, Nexia Home Intelligence, and SmartThings, Insteon's Starter Kit doesn't offer you conditional, IFTTT-style automation between multiple devices, at least not without paying for additional devices and upgrades to your system. Even then, the process of getting these devices working in tandem is far more cumbersome than it ought to be, and certainly more of a headache than what we've seen with other systems. For instance, even once you buy a separate Insteon-compatible motion detector, the app won't let you simply connect it directly to another device to power it on and off with motion. To do that, you'll need to connect the motion detector with a ""Scene"" of linked devices that automate simultaneously. It's a far clunkier process than what we've seen in the WeMo app, or the highly intuitive and powerful Nexia website.

All in all, it's a pretty heavy limitation given the current trend toward conditional automation, and it's a shortcoming that we hope Insteon addresses as it continues updating its products and app. Still, if you have a a specific interest in controlling and monitoring your smart devices remotely, you'll want to give Insteon a look, especially if you're looking to avoid paying monthly fees and don't have a specific need for more powerful programming right out of the box. If you decide Insteon would work for you, then the Best Buy-exclusive Starter Kit, which costs $10 less than the Insteon Hub does on its own, is the way you'll want to go.

Design and featuresAt first glance, you might mistake the Insteon Hub for a Wii accessory. It's a stark, minimalist device, with just one blue LED light, two ports (Ethernet and power), and no buttons, save for the tiny reset button hidden in the back. To get your system up and running, you'll plug the Hub into a wall outlet (Insteon asks you to avoid power strips, if possible), then plug it into your router using the included Ethernet cable. From there, the free Insteon Hub app, available for both iOS and Android, will take care of the rest, making quick, easy work of the setup process. This includes adding the LampLinc dimmers to your system -- just tell the app you're adding a device, then hold the ""set"" button down on each dimmer you want to add.

The LampLinc dimmers look fine, and match the Hub with their stark, blocky white finish and LED light. They won't block an entire wall outlet, so long as you use the bottom socket. However, you'll have to plug your lamp up into the bottom of each dimmer, so if your outlets sit low to the ground, plugging your lamp in might be awkward. Placing the socket on the front of the device, as the WeMo Switch does, would have been a better design call.

As for the app, it's pretty bare-bones for the home automation scene, but it does the job. You can assign one of a few dozen icons to each of your devices (for my flex lamp, I went with a light bulb). Tapping that icon will then allow you to control that device. In the case of the light dimmers, you'll be able to turn a lamp on or off, or by pressing a small plus sign icon, you'll have access to a dimming slider, along with up and down arrows that will let you ""bump"" the light level up or down. If you tap the gear icon, then ""Edit settings,"" then select the device you want to tinker with, you'll be able to rename it, change the icon, set up a schedule for when you want it to activate and deactivate, and also set alerts that will notify you whenever the device turns on or off. None of it is too difficult or complicated, but as apps go, it's probably a bit clunkier than it needs to be, and definitely somewhat lacking in polish.

The limitations of the Insteon system become evident the more you use the app. Some are fairly trivial, such as the fact that you can't create custom icons for your devices by snapping pictures of them, the way you can with most other home automation apps. Others are more disappointing, like the fact that the app will only let you set one schedule for each lamp -- one time for it to turn on, and one time for it to turn off.

You can't add additional timing rules from the LampLinc's in-app device settings, although there is a workaround that again involves the app's customizable scenes. A morning scene might have all of your lights turn on together at 7 a.m., for instance. If you wanted to create an additional schedule for a lamp, you could simply create a scene with that lamp as its only device. Still, this is barely acceptable. Setting multiple on and off times for a device is about as standard as home automation gets these days. The fact that Insteon forces you to employ a workaround to accomplish such basic functionality doesn't inspire much confidence in the thoughtfulness of the system.

Usability and performance  Limitations aside, the Insteon app is a largely reliable piece of software. When you log in and tell the app to turn your lamp on, you can feel confident that it's going to turn your lamp on. Interestingly enough, the app differentiates between local usage and remote usage. Getting the app to work on your local network is a piece of cake, but Insteon openly acknowledges that the router wrangling and port forwarding required before you'll be able to monitor and control your devices from beyond your home network might be a bit tricky, especially for networking novices.

This is actually where Insteon shines a little bit, bracing users for a potential challenge by offering them step-by-step instructions specific to their particular brand of router, all directly within the app. Users still experiencing difficulty are also encouraged to call Insteon toll free for live assistance. It's a refreshingly honest and straightforward approach to an often finicky area of home automation, where full setup is rarely as simple as the product's instructions would have you believe.

In terms of performance testing, the Insteon Starter Kit's limited functionality didn't leave a lot of room for experimentation. Scheduling lights to automatically come on and off worked just fine in every one of our tests, and manual controls were equally reliable. I was not, however, able to get the Insteon app to alert me when the light was turned on or off, despite explicitly telling it to do so. This included instances where the light was turned on and off automatically as well as instances where I turned it on and off manually, through the app's local network controls. Curious about this, I added an Insteon Motion Sensor to the network and set the app to alert me whenever it detected motion. The SMS alerts came through just as promised each and every time. Still, when it came to lights, nothing I tried got the alerts to come through in any form. This was a definite disappointment, and a bit of a head-scratcher, as well.

Maintenance By design, home automation systems typically don't require a great deal of maintenance, if any, and the Insteon is no different. Once you've got your system up and running, you can largely forget about it. Neither the Hub nor the LampLinc dimmers run on batteries, although some of the additional, separately sold sensors, like the motion detector, do. If you add any of these to your system, you'll need to change the batteries periodically. Unlike some other home automation apps, the Insteon's app will not track the remaining battery life of your devices, or alert you if their batteries are running low.

Service and support  Should you encounter any difficulties with your system, Insteon offers toll-free technical support over the phone six days a week, and also one-on-one live chat support through its Web site. The site also features an online version of the same port forwarding guide included within the app, as well as full documentation for every Insteon-compatible sensor and accessory currently available for sale.

Conclusion  In years past, the Insteon system's limitations and inconsistencies wouldn't have been as noticeable or as damning. However, the home automation game has changed, with new options available that are more powerful, more flexible, and more affordable than ever before. The bar has been raised, and Insteon hasn't necessarily risen to meet the challenge. Still, experienced home automators with aging systems might appreciate that the Insteon claims to be compatible with existing X10 devices, and for these existing networks, the Insteon Hub might make a good fit. People looking for something specific from their system, like leak or smoke detection, might also be satisfied with the Insteon's wide array of specific automatable sensors.

However, for people new to home automation, Insteon's Starter Kit isn't anything close to the starter kit I'd recommend. For $119, you're getting a system capable of lamp automation and lamp automation alone, and unless you purchase a separate motion detector or other upgrades, those automations will be about as basic as it gets. Compare that with the Belkin WeMo Switch + Motion, which costs $40 less ($70 less if you don't want the motion detector), can automate anything with a plug on it (not just lamps), and is fully compatible with IFTTT and the highly advanced conditional automation that comes with it - all right out of the box, no additional components or upgrades necessary. Which one sounds like the smarter start to you?"
