      "1-Ring Moon\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think smart home tech is creepy, the Moon will be a great device to prove your point. It's a floating eyeball-shaped security cam that can rotate to follow your movements. If you think smart home tech is exciting and inventive, well, the Moon might help you prove that point as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to its description, the Moon is a levitating smart home camera that doubles as a smart home hub from Delaware-based startup 1-Ring. Because the base charges the cam wirelessly while it floats, it can supposedly levitate in perpetuity. From the app, you can rotate the cam to look around the room. It also has motion sensing and microphones on either side of the lens, so it knows what direction a sound is coming from, and can turn silently (since it floats) to track the noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company's Indiegogo campaign (currently more than 200 percent funded) says you can customize what the camera does when it senses something -- you can receive a notification, record a video clip or snap a photo. The Moon stores footage locally on a microSD card or uploads it to your cloud drive of choice -- whether that's your personal Dropbox account, Google Drive or your own FTP server.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Moon sounds cool as a security camera -- yes, the floating aspect is neat, and I particularly like that you can save footage on your cloud service of choice -- it checks a lot of other boxes as a multipurpose smart tool. It'll work as a hub with built-in Wi-Fi (as you'd expect) as well as Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth, NFC and even an IR blaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moon will launch with a few impressive smart home partners, including Philips Hue, SmartThings and Honeywell. In theory, you'll be able to connect smaller smart home gadgets such as your light bulbs and switches to the Moon, and then control them with the Moon app.\n",
      "\n",
      "1-Ring hasn't specified which SmartThings and Philips Hue devices its product works with, or what types of devices it's compatible with. Hopefully, you'll be able to use the Moon in place of a SmartThings or Philips hub, and we've reached out to 1-Ring to confirm these details.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moon will also work with all three major voice assistants -- Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Plus, the IR blaster will supposedly let the Moon control your TV and speakers as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "1-Ring says it also put temp, humidity and carbon dioxide sensors in the Moon, and you can customize notifications based on those readings. It has a built-in speaker, so you can use it for video calls. Plus, the microphones built into the cam will supposedly recognize the difference between talking, crying and glass breaking. The cam's specs also look impressive:\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, please note that CNET's reporting on crowdfunding campaigns is not an endorsement of the project or its creators. Before contributing to any campaign, read the crowdfunding site's policies -- in this case, Indiegogo -- to find out your rights (and its refund policies, or the lack thereof) before and after a campaign ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming the Moon comes to fruition, it has a nice combination of features to keep up with our favorite smart home cams. You can preorder the floating cam now via the company's Indiegogo campaign. There's a discount for preordering, and 1-Ring says it will ship the cam anywhere in the world. At retail, the Moon costs $330 -- an expensive price for a smart home cam, but a reasonable one for a celestial body. That price converts to roughly £250 and AU$430.\n",
      "\n",
      "1080p HD resolutionIt films at 30 frames per secondThe lens has a 130-degree viewing angleIt has an infrared LED for night visionThe spherical cam is magnetic, so you can take it off its floating base and stick it to another surfaceThe cam's battery will supposedly last up to five hours away from the base.The Moon can create time-lapse footage from your dayIts away mode cycles connected lights on and off to make it look like you're home\n",
      "Feit Electric 6.5W Vintage Style LED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nostalgia is big business these days, and even your light bulbs want in. Enter a growing crop of \"vintage\" LEDs with fake filaments meant to mimic the old-school look of yesteryear's incandescents. Distinctive yet efficient, these classic-looking bulbs want to bring early 20th century lighting into the early 21st century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feit has been especially aggressive here, with a wide assortment of vintage-style LED bulbs eating up a good-size chunk of the lighting aisle at Home Depot. The newest among them offer improved designs with filaments twisted into spirals, helices and other artistic patterns meant to dial up the nostalgia. And, sure enough, they look pretty darned good.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of them are as bright as a standard, household bulb should be, but that's sort of the point here. The idea isn't to hide them under a lampshade for practical lighting, but to show them off in exposed bulb setups. You want to be able to look at them and appreciate them without squinting.\n",
      "\n",
      "For setups like that, they're some of the best-looking bulbs you can buy, and with prices ranging from $8 to $12 each, they aren't unreasonably expensive. That, coupled with relatively strong dimming performance and the efficiency you'd expect from LEDs, makes them an easy recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "First things first, let's talk specs, starting with the centerpiece of Feit's vintage-styled lineup, an $11 elongated 6.5W LED that claims a light output of 250 lumens. I clocked it well above that figure in CNET's lighting lab, with a final reading of 326 lumens -- less than you'd expect from the sort of 40W bulb you might use in an accent lamp, but still bright enough to serve as a functional decoration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tested a few of Feit's other vintage-style bulbs, too, and all of them came in over spec. A classic, A-shaped LED that costs $10 and claims a light output of 125 lumens actually measured in at 147 lumens. Similarly, an $8 candelabra LED with a stated light output of 125 lumens actually came in at 152 lumens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, none of those are as bright as more traditional-looking bulbs, and they're not as bright as competing vintage-style bulbs, either. For instance, GE offers an elongated glass LED with a fake filament -- it doesn't look quite as distinctive as the Feit bulb, but it puts out 447 lumens, enough to call itself a legitimate 40W replacement. An A-shaped vintage-style LED from Philips does even better, putting out 855 lumens. That bulb comes in a $12 two-pack, making it a much better value than the $10 A-shaped Feit LED.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like those competitors, the Feit LEDs each create the appearance of an old-school tungsten filament inside the bulb by arranging the light-emitting diodes into tiny strips. That Feit thought to bend those strips into more artistic designs seems a little obvious in hindsight -- I'll bet that Philips, GE and others are wishing they'd thought of it first. I also appreciated that each of Feit's bulbs did a surprisingly good job of casting light out evenly in all directions, without too much shadowy \"texture\" to the light (a problem I saw with both the GE and the Philips bulbs).\n",
      "\n",
      "The color temperature is another important part of the nostalgic design. No problems here, as Feit gave each bulb a nice, low, orangey glow of 2,150 K (the A-shaped bulb I tested uses yellow-tinted glass, and claims an even lower color temperature of 2,000 K). I measured all of them within 20 degrees Kelvin of their target temperatures, which is an excellent and accurate result.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also made sure to take a good look at the dimming capabilities of each bulb. Like the old-fashioned incandescents they imitate, vintage-style LEDs like these look great when you dim them down low. That makes dimming a key performance metric -- and, all in all, Feit's bulbs did a great job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of the three I tested was able to dim smoothly down to total darkness on every dimmer switch I tested, which is very good. The elongated LED only emitted about 70 percent of its total light output at the max setting on two of the newer, slider-style dimmer switches I tested, but I can forgive that since it's about 30 percent brighter than advertised to begin with, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did notice a slow and very slight flicker from all three bulbs at low settings, though. It wouldn't be enough to annoy me, but it was enough to be noticeable, and enough to keep me from saying that they aced the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "These bulbs aren't bright enough to merit a spot beneath your bedside reading lamp's lampshade, but that's not what they're intended for. For exposed bulb setups where the aesthetic is more important than the light output, they'll do the trick, and they'll perform well on dimmer switches, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "At $11, the price of that elongated LED is a little high, but not unreasonably so -- and if you're choosing it over an actual incandescent, you'll earn a lot of that money back in energy savings over the long run (at three hours of use per day, it'll add just 78 cents to your yearly energy bill, and it's rated to last well over a decade). As a decorative, artsy accent bulb, I think it's a pretty good-looking pick.\n",
      "Kwikset Obsidian Keywayless Smart Lock\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With so many smart locks elbowing for the spotlight, Kwikset keeps it simple with its newest touchscreen deadbolt, the Obsidian. No keys, no Bluetooth, just a touchscreen keypad and a deadbolt. At $180, Kwikset's standalone version of this lock is a minimalistic and stylish approach to keyless entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Named for the volcanic rock it channels in the black shine of the keypad, the Obsidian comes in two versions. The $180 standalone version is a touchscreen deadbolt and nothing more. A $229 Home Connect version will include Z-Wave Plus, a certification for the latest Z-Wave 500 series platform. with extended wireless range, over-the-air firmware updates and wireless encryption. We tested the standalone version at the CNET Smart Apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The touchscreen keypad is the centerpiece here, and it looks very similar to the keypad on the Kwikset Premis ($161.10 at Amazon.com) model we tested last year. Like most smart locks, the Obsidian is powered by four AA batteries that sit in the top of the lock. Audio and LED light alerts notify you of low batteries at three low battery levels, but should your batteries die, there are 9V jumpstart nodes on the bottom of the lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation was simple. I measured two different dimensions of my door to be sure I was using the correct screws and to determine if I needed an adapter plate. Kwikset includes detailed instructions on how to measure and plenty of hardware options. Once you've attached both sides of the lock to the door, the Obsidian automatically calibrates itself and you're ready to set a code.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Obsidian accepts up to 16 user codes. Each code must be between four and eight digits. You can also enable a mastercode to approve additional codes or remove them. To add a user code, push the programming button under the lock's interior cover, press the checkmark symbol on the keypad and enter a four- to eight-digit code followed by the lock symbol. The Obsidian's upcoming Home Connect version supports 30 user codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Locking and unlocking it with the keypad is pretty intuitive. To lock the door, press the lock button on the bottom right corner of the keypad. To unlock, activate the keypad by touching it and enter your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kwikset's automatic relock feature locks the door 30 seconds after it's unlocked. This worked every time for me. The SecureScreen function also worked well. When entering your code, Obsidian will prompt you with two decoy digits. Press those, followed by your code. SecureScreen defends against would-be intruders inspecting fingerprints, and I'm a fan of it, especially given the shiny touchpad is prone to fingerprint trails.\n",
      "\n",
      "An LED on the interior side of the lock lets you know if the deadbolt is locked or unlocked. Every 6 seconds, the LED will flash amber for locked and green for unlocked. You can turn this feature off, as you can with SecureScreen, audio and automatic relock. It's a bit annoying to access these switches. A small board of tiny switches under the interior side cover control each of these features. You'll need to unscrew three screws on the faceplate to get to it. If you want to disable automatic relocking to leave your door open for a party or special circumstance, you'll need to find a screwdriver.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Z-Wave Plus version coming later this year, you'll be able to control the lock using smart home platforms and security apps. The Obsidian won't have its own app like the Kevo did, but integration with third-party smart home platforms and security apps aims to make up for that. You'll still be able to connect the lock to your home automation platforms and incorporate it into routines. The Obsidian also doesn't offer Bluetooth connection, so there won't be any keyfobs or walking up to your door to unlock it with a phone, like we saw in the Kevo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Obsidian is just what you would expect from a touchscreen deadbolt. It's responsive, comes with added convenience and security features like SecureScreen, automatic relocking and up to 16 user codes. It's also simple. There's no Bluetooth key or remote access with the standalone version. It's just a deadbolt. There's also no physical key at all, for that matter. No key means no fumbling for things in your pocket or purse. If you like the comfort of a physical key, however, or you're looking for Bluetooth capability, Kwikset's Premis or Kevo might be more your style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are we ready for keyless entry? Personally, I've always liked the look and functionality of keypads. If you're anything like me, you'll appreciate the elegance and responsiveness of Kwikset's latest lock. If the Home Connect, Z-Wave Plus-equipped version is as true to form as the standalone lock, Obsidian will be tough to beat for a smart keypad deadbolt.\n",
      "Honeywell Smart Home Security System\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Honeywell teased an upcoming security system in mid-October. The thermostat giant Wednesday shared more details about its US-only Smart Home Security System. Available starting Wednesday through Indiegogo, the do-it-yourself kit will make its way to retail in early 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the gist. The Smart Home Security System is a scalable (and largely indoor) DIY home security system. The Camera Base Station acts as the system's central hub. It's outfitted with 1080p high-definition livestreaming, a 145-degree viewing angle and free 24-hour cloud storage (this will jump up to three days during a future update).\n",
      "\n",
      "The system also comes with a variety of optional accessories, including door and window sensors, key fobs, motion sensors and indoor or outdoor MotionViewers -- cameras with integrated motion sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a list of the products available with the system and their retail prices:\n",
      "\n",
      "Starter Kit (Camera Base Station, 2 Access Sensors, Key Fob) -- $500Camera Base Station -- $400Door and Window Access Sensors -- $40Key Fob -- $30Motion Sensor -- $50Indoor MotionViewer -- $80Outdoor MotionViewer -- $170\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Honeywell says Indiegogo backers will get a discount through Dec. 16, but haven't yet shared how much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honeywell is just one of a number of companies introducing DIY home security systems. Nest, Ring, Wink and SmartThings have all announced new systems within the last two months. At $500, Honeywell's Starter Kit is priced to compete with the $499 Nest Secure alarm system and the $550 SmartThings Starter Kit. Both the Ring and the Wink starter kits cost $199.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to offering a bunch of optional accessories, Honeywell's Smart Home Security System will also come with geofencing, scenes and Amazon Alexa voice control built into the Camera Base Station. So, like the Alexa-enabled Ecobee4 Smart Thermostat, Honeywell's camera is an Alexa speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "This system will also support facial recognition, thanks to a customizable database of friends, family and other folks who regularly visit your house. Honeywell says \"audio analytics\" are in the works as well, so the system should eventually be able to distinguish between your smoke detector and your dog barking to alert you accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, please note that CNET's reporting on crowdfunding campaigns is not an endorsement of the project or its creators.

      "Friday Smart Lock\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After two years of crowdfunding and development, the Friday Labs Smart Lock is here. This $249 smart lock claims to be the world's smallest retrofit lock, and it's definitely easy on the eyes. I can't recommend you rush out and buy it just yet though, as it's still got some learning to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Friday was designed by Big Ideas, the think tank within architecture's well-known Bjarke Ingels Group. It's clear the priority here was design, and I think it's miles ahead of the competition in that regard. Measuring just 2.7 inches in diameter, it's significantly smaller and less bulky than August's line of retrofit locks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lock's metal shell is available in seven metal finishes. With so many color options and a measured compromise between modern and traditional design, this lock will look good almost anywhere. You can easily change the shells by sliding a credit card beneath it to release a clip. Friday Labs has yet to offer individual shells for sale -- you have to buy the whole lock -- but that's something it says is coming very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation is simple in theory. The instructions do warn that if the tailpiece is too long, however, you'll need a hacksaw (not included) to shorten it. Be warned: If you go this route, you won't be able to change your mind and put your old thumb latch back on. You'll need a whole new lock system, since you've sawed away at the first one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Friday is designed to work with your existing lock, and I found that to be true with a few caveats. I didn't have to do any sawing, and in fact, more than one of our doors had both cylinder and turn knob tailpieces, making the cylinder tailpiece just barely too short to reach the Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also ran into an issue with my deadbolt's machine screws. The round-headed screws that came with my deadbolt blocked the Friday turning mechanism, preventing it from functioning. Friday Labs says it can provide countersunk screws if you have this issue. I swapped my machine screws out for a flatter pair and had no problems with the rest of installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Friday comes with a large, rechargeable battery and USB-powered charging cradle, instead of the more common four-AA setup. Friday Labs says the lock's battery should last for at least three months and up to nine months, depending on use. August claims up to a year of battery life, and we've seen that to be relatively accurate, so the Friday sounds like a bit of a power hog by its own estimation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notifications in the app will let you know when your battery is low. Having a rechargeable battery might save you trips to the store for AAs, but it also means your lock has to be turned by hand while the battery charges, which would take about 1.5 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Friday Lock also comes with \"over-torque,\" a preventive solution to gear breakage and short-circuiting. Two spring levers sit in the faceplate and detect when it's being twisted against its will while the motor is running. Should this happen, it will mechanically disengage the gearing to protect the lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once your lock is installed, the Friday Labs app guides you through naming the device, setting up multiple users and calibrating the lock by opening and closing the door. The app also includes Friday Assist for locking and unlocking. Toggle these two options and the deadbolt will lock when you close the door, and unlock when you approach it. Friday Labs uses geofencing to enable the unlock assist feature, meaning the app will detect the location of your phone and detect if you're within a certain distance of the lock. Unlock assist worked much better than the lock assist feature in my experience, though both were intermittent at best, which doesn't inspire confidence in that feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where it starts to get hairier. As far as HomeKit compatibility, you can use Apple's smart home platform to lock and unlock the Friday lock. You can also incorporate it into multidevice scenes. Remote access for these features, however, works only if you have an iPad ($339.00 at Amazon.com) or Apple TV set up as your HomeKit hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wi-Fi is supported, but not enabled yet, and Android users are out of luck as far as remote access goes. A firmware update is in the works to enable Wi-Fi for better integration with smart home platforms, but there's no word on when exactly that will happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday's app is where most of the action happens, and it does let you set guests and designate an owner. Guests get unlimited access, however. There's no scheduling or creating temporary Bluetooth keys, although Friday Labs also promises a future firmware update to enable this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Temporary, recurring and scheduled access is a common feature in most high-end smart locks. We've seen it in Kwikset's eKey and in August locks, among others. It's especially useful for Airbnb owners, people with dog walkers and pretty much anyone who might ever need someone to stop by their house. I'm disappointed that feature isn't currently available with this lock and hoping Friday Labs pushes that update out soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really wanted to love this lock. It looks much better than any retrofit lock we've seen thus far. The hardware is great, but the software just isn't there yet, and Friday Labs knows it. Keep an eye on this lock as firmware updates roll out. That Wi-Fi update is supposed to appear by the holidays, and if this and other shortfalls are addressed, the Friday Lock has real potential. Until then, you're better off with a clunkier, but smarter August Smart Lock Pro ($279.99 at Amazon.com).\n",
      "Noon Smart Lighting Starter Kit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Noon Home, Inc., a company founded by executive with histories at Nest, August, Google, Roku and more, launches today. With that launch, Noon Home introduces its first product, the Noon Smart Lighting System. The system is designed to integrate existing light fixtures and bulbs into a layered light experience, and its $400 starter kit includes one room director switch, two extension switches and three wall plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Layered light is a type of lighting design that blends each of the lights in a room to improve how the room looks and feels. Noon based its research on studies done by John E. Flynn in the 1970s exploring the way a room's lighting changes a person's perception of the room, in addition to a person's mood. Noon's system identifies your existing lights and creates optimal, layered lighting for that environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noon uses a patented bulb detection technology to identify bulb type by reading electrical currents and using algorithms decide what type of bulb is present. It's compatible with dimmable and non-dimmable bulbs, incandescent, LED, CFL, fluorescent, ELV (electronic low voltage) and MLV (magnetic low voltage) fixtures. The room director switch also communicates with the expansion switches wirelessly via Bluetooth, while the Noon app guides you through setup to tell Noon which fixtures and rooms it's controlling. Once everything is identified, Noon uses the bulb, fixture and room information you've provided to minimize low-level popping, flickering and buzzing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kit's room director switch powers the system and controls companion extension switches via wireless Bluetooth technology. Once you install it, the room director switch also becomes the system's touchscreen, OLED control panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noon automatically creates three scenes: Relax, Everyday and Bright. Homeowners can create their own custom scenes and select them at the switch or in the Noon companion app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system is designed for DIY installation, but it does involve tinkering with your home's wiring. For that reason, Noon offers professional installation through InstallerNet. Professional install starts at $149 for up to three switches and $20 for each additional switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Noon starter kit itself is expensive at $400. While the system is clearly aimed at open-concept living spaces, should you decide to expand into multiple rooms the costs will add up quickly. The room director switch and extension can be purchased separately for $200 and $100 respectively. Starter kits are available at select Best Buy stores, b8ta and online at NoonHome.com. A handful of Home Depot locations will carry Noon products starting November 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "At launch, Noon will support voice activation with Amazon Alexa, though it won't integrate with any other smart home platforms. By comparison, Lutron connects with Alexa, Nest, IFTTT, Apple HomeKit and more with its reliable and simple smart-lighting design.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've seen the touchscreen approach to lighting control before, too, with the ill-fated Wink Relay among others. Noon Home may face a similar uphill battle gaining consumer interest in touchscreen controls. Lutron's Caseta smart lighting kit is by far the product to beat, and we'll see how Noon Home stacks up as we test the system in the near future.\n",
      "Amazon Echo Plus\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If Alexa taught us anything, it's the importance of good software. In Alexa's case, it's what made the original Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) smart speaker so compelling. On its own, the Echo itself was just your average Bluetooth speaker -- it was Alexa, Amazon's cloud-connected, voice-activated AI assistant, that made the Echo a game-changer.\n",
      "\n",
      "That brings us to the new Echo Plus. At $150 or £140, it looks just like the original Echo, but the \"plus\" part is that it adds in a radio for Zigbee, a wireless standard used by certain smart home gadgets, including Philips Hue smart bulbs, SmartThings plugs, and connected locks from Kwikset and Yale. Thanks to that Zigbee radio, the Echo Plus can talk directly to those gadgets and tell them what to do. You don't need to plug an extra bridge or hub into your router to translate the Zigbee signals, because the Echo Plus is already fluent. It is the hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, coupled with an incremental uptick in sound quality, makes the Echo Plus a good piece of hardware. The software, however, leaves a lot to be desired with clunky, underdeveloped smart home controls in the Alexa app that don't do as much as they really should. The Echo Plus has other strengths, like an aux-out jack and a new ability to launch multifaceted \"routines\" with a single voice command -- but they're the same strengths that you'll get with the new, second-gen Echo, which costs $50 or £50 less.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the right app updates the Echo Plus could improve over time, and that's probably what will happen. Until it does, though, I wouldn't build a smart home around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Echo Plus comes in your choice of three colors: black, white or a new silver option. Get it in black or white, and you'll have a very hard time distinguishing it from the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way to tell is in the back -- the Echo Plus added in an aux-out jack, just like the second-gen Echo did. That'll let you connect to external speakers using a 3.5mm cable (you can also connect wirelessly via Bluetooth). That's a nice touch, but if you're just looking for an Alexa device to connect with your high-end speaker setup, you're better off just getting an Echo Dot and saving $100 or £90.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other note: With the old design making an encore, the Echo Plus is now the only Alexa device currently on sale that offers a volume ring up top. The second-gen Echo ditched that volume ring in favor of the Echo Dot's volume buttons to help get the cost down. I prefer the ring -- it feels classier, and it's easier to use in a dark room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of sound quality, the Echo Plus does indeed sound a little bit better than the original Echo, at least to my ear. Both are almost equally as powerful, but I noticed better balance between highs and lows and slightly less distortion at high volumes with the Echo Plus. It's a very subtle difference, and not one that you're likely to notice unless, like me, you spend a good chunk of your day listening for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That puts the Echo Plus' sound quality much closer to the Echo than to competitors that put more of an emphasis on pristine audio. Like the Echo, it's perfectly capable of filling a room with good-sounding music, but if you're hoping for a high-fidelity audio experience, you might come away disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more noticeable uptick in sound quality would have gone a long way towards helping the Plus live up to its name, but the addition of an aux-out jack renders that point largely moot -- audiophiles probably already have a setup they're happy with, and in most cases, the Echo Plus can pipe music through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The addition of a Zigbee radio means that the Echo Plus can connect directly with Zigbee gadgets, of which there are many. The most notable name in that mix is Philips Hue -- with the Echo Plus, you can connect with any of the numerous Hue-branded lamps, light bulbs and light strips available and control them right from the Alexa app, no Hue Bridge necessary. That's a tempting way to try out a single bulb before committing to an entire Philips Hue starter kit.\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, Amazon is currently offering a free Hue White LED with every Echo Plus, a $15 value. Nice touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there's a glaring problem with that integration with Hue, and that's that the Alexa app can't change the color of color-changing bulbs. Alexa can via voice command, but the app itself only lets you turn lights on and off or adjust their brightness. That obviously isn't ideal -- voice commands are great for quick changes, but sometimes, you're going to want to use an app's color selector to dial in on a specific shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could do so easily using the Philips Hue app -- but the app can't connect with the bulbs unless you've got the Hue Bridge plugged into your router. Kind of undercuts the whole point of having an Echo Plus, doesn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "That limitation extends to other Zigbee bulbs with multiple color settings, too. For instance, I was able to pair the Echo Plus with a Tradfri smart bulb from Ikea that offers different color temperature settings ranging from warm white to cool daylight. I could adjust the tint of the light using voice commands, but not using the Alexa app. Alexa, add color control to your to-do list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another shortcoming -- the Echo Plus can't really do anything with things like motion detectors, open/closed sensors for doors and windows, leak detectors, sirens and other common Zigbee devices. You can pair them with the Echo Plus and see them in the app, but you can't use the app to automate them alongside your lights, locks, thermostats and other Alexa-friendly devices. For now, they're just dead weight, which undercuts the Echo Plus' smart hub appeal even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all I know, support for devices like these could be an app update away, but Amazon wouldn't speculate on its roadmap when I asked, telling me, \"Alexa is always getting smarter and we aim to make updates based on customer feedback.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One last note: Zigbee opens up a lot of new possibilities, but it's just one standard. Most smart home hubs are compatible with multiple standards, including both Zigbee and Z-Wave. Amazon could have positioned the Echo Plus a little better by following suit, or even by going one step further and partnering with a proprietary brand such as Lutron or Insteon to offer direct control of those devices, too. Instead, you just get Zigbee. That's good, but not great.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know how you get excited when a new version of your phone's operating system arrives, complete with all sorts of new features and gimmicks to try out? Take that feeling and stretch it out over several months, with the new features arriving every week or two. That's what it's like owning an Echo device. It's an ever-evolving, voice-activated operating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest addition to Alexa's bag of tricks is a feature called routines. The idea is simple -- you pick your own custom Alexa command, then you pick what you want to have happen whenever you say it. A single routine can trigger multiple things at once -- for instance, saying, \"Alexa, goodnight,\" could turn your lights off, lock your doors and fire up a bedroom space heater.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's room for creativity here. For instance, you could say, \"Alexa, wake up the kid,\" to trigger a routine that would turn their bedroom lights on and start playing the morning's flash briefing from the Echo Dot on their nightstand. Nothing like a little NPR to nudge Junior out of bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truly sadistic among us might prefer to wake a sleepy teenager by blasting out, say, Chumbawumba, or perhaps a rousing rendition of \"Who Let the Dogs Out?\" Unfortunately (or fortunately, in Junior's case), triggering songs and playlists isn't an option with routines. I'd love to see Amazon change that and start allowing users to bring music playback -- still one of Alexa's core features -- into the fold. Heck, it could even be an exclusive feature for Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers. That'd be enough to get me to switch over from Spotify (and if nothing else, it could make for some entertaining new Alexa commercials).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other limitations with routines. For instance, that wake-up routine can turn the lights on, but you can't set it to gradually fade them on like you can with a good, dedicated smart lighting app (Philips Hue, Lifx, Lutron and others can all handle prescheduled fades). And while you can trigger any scenes that you've imported in from apps like those, you can't trigger groups of devices. Instead, you have to trigger each device individually within the routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another big limitation: routines don't currently support smart thermostats such as the Nest or the Ecobee4. Chalk another one up for Alexa's to-do list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the pros outweigh the cons. The ability to craft your own custom Alexa commands is long overdue; the fact that those commands can trigger multiple things at once only sweetens the deal. And, like the rest of Alexa's features, it's a feature that should improve over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Routines aren't specific to the Echo Plus -- you can program them with any Echo device, even the old ones. The same goes for the fact that you can now add each of your Echo devices in with a default group of lights, then control those lights just by saying \"turn the lights on.\" Both are nice steps forward for Alexa, but neither is a reason to pick the Echo Plus over any other Echo gadget.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the app itself, it got a minor design overhaul just in time for the Echo Plus, with a new layout for your smart home gadgets and new in-app controls for turning everything on and off. Tap a little question mark icon, and you'll also find helpful and specific pairing instructions for all of the compatible Zigbee brands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app is a bit bland-looking, and it isn't as neatly organized as other smart home control apps. It lists your devices in alphabetical order, and you can't sort them by room or by date added. It isn't terrible by any stretch, but it's too basic to call itself a comprehensive smart home control app, and too basic to set itself apart from better-developed competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Echo Plus has plenty of potential. Alexa has already proven to be a capable quarterback for the connected living space -- packing her into a dedicated smart home hub makes plenty of sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, that hub has to be good. And while it's just as good a smart speaker as the original Echo, if not better, the Echo Plus is actually a pretty mediocre hub. It isn't as fully featured as the competition. It only works with Zigbee. It doesn't do anything with sensors and sirens. The app is poorly organized.\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost wonder if Amazon would have been better off foregoing the full-sized approach and, instead, making the Echo Plus more like the Echo Dot. After all, the Zigbee radio is the only real reason to buy the Plus over another Echo device -- by packing it into a full-sized speaker at $150 or £140, Amazon is forcing Zigbee enthusiasts to pay for more than they may actually need.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that is enough for me to tell you to wait on the Echo Plus. There's plenty of potential, yes, but it just isn't there yet.\n",
      "Wink Lookout\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Add Wink to the growing list of companies with a DIY home security system. The smart hub maker, acquired in July by Will.i.am's tech company I.am+, just debuted a self-monitored security kit called Lookout. Scheduled for an Oct. 31 release, the $199 US-only Lookout includes two door/window sensors, one motion sensor, one siren and chime and one second-generation Wink hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Lookout's Z-Wave-enabled door/window, motion and siren and chime devices are new for the brand, Wink relies on its existing hub as the bridge to translate everything over Wi-Fi. Note: If you already have a first- or second-gen Wink hub, you can buy Lookout accessories a la carte -- it's $29 per door/window sensor, $39 per motion sensor and $39 per siren and chime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wink also plans to update its app with a \"dashboard\" layout for easy access to alerts and security activity. You can add a variety of partner product integrations to the mix as well; here's a list of devices that work with Wink.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what separates the Lookout from the DIY systems recently introduced by Nest, SmartThings, Ring and Honeywell? Not much, as far as I can tell -- except its relatively low price.\n",
      "\n",
      "SmartThings' new security system, announced in early October in partnership with ADT, costs $550. Nest's Secure starter kit will set you back $499. Only Ring's $199 Protect system is comparably priced, but it offers optional professional monitoring. Wink's system will not include monitoring, which could be a deal breaker for some customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $199 Wink Lookout will be available on Amazon, Wink's online store and at Home Depot starting Oct. 31. We hope to test Lookout and its competitors soon for a side-by-side home security showdown. Stay tuned.\n",
      "Lynky\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Google's rumored competitor to the Amazon Echo Show ($229.99 at Amazon.com) hasn't yet come to fruition, so a startup called Lynky is taking it upon itself to fill the gap. The device -- also called Lynky -- combines a 5-inch touchscreen with two far-field microphones for voice commands, and it has the Google Assistant built-in. Like a Google Home combined with a tablet combined with a smart home hub, the Lynky either sits on your desk, or mounts on your wall in place of a light switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lynky makes its debut on Indiegogo on Tuesday, and you'll supposedly be able to use the device just like Google's smart speaker, the Google Home ($129.00 at Dell Home). The Lynky uses the same digital assistant, simply called Google Assistant. Give a voice command and you can play music, access your calendar, search the web or control your smart home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the Amazon Echo Show, the Lynky combines the functionality of a voice assistant with a touchscreen. The Echo Show offered all of the functionality of the original Echo -- a competitor to Google Home -- thanks to Amazon's assistant Alexa, and allowed you to make video calls. Unlike the Echo Show, the Lynky's screen will focus more on smart home assistance than video calls as the device doesn't have a built-in camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the Google Home, you also can't make voice calls with Lynky, as that's one of the limits Google puts on third-party devices with its Assistant built in. What you can do is use Lynky as your smart home hub, as it comes with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Zigbee built-in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart lightbulbs, smart locks and small smart sensors for your doors and windows frequently don't talk directly to your router, as signaling with Wi-Fi takes a lot of battery. These devices communicate with a specialized frequency such as Zigbee and need a bridge to translate their message to send it to the cloud. The Lynky will act as that bridge for a variety of devices, so you won't need to buy a separate hub for your motion sensors or smart bulbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll be able to control compatible devices with your voice via the Google Assistant. You'll also be able to control them with the touchscreen and set up scenes to control multiple devices with a single touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supposedly, different Lynky devices can communicate with each other -- so you can set up devices with your bedroom Lynky, and control them from another unit in the kitchen. Alternatively, in a nice extra, you can limit the access of a device -- so a guest room Lynky can be limited to controlling just the guest room smart devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lynky has a list of compatible smart home devices on the company's Indiegogo page. You'll be able to use the Lynky as a hub for devices from these companies, but hopefully you can also control devices from Google's larger list of smart home partners. The Google Assistant has its own smart home setup process through the Google Home app. I'd hope the Lynky can seamlessly integrate with these settings. Lynky is supposedly working on making this sync up possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lynky will launch with an open platform, so smart home developers will theoretically have an easy time working with it. It'll also work with online-rule maker IFTTT and its numerous smart home partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than smart home controls, the Lynky looks to be underusing its touchscreen, as it doesn't appear that you can install other apps, watch videos, or generally use the Lynky as a tablet. Given its price, limited touchscreen functionality is understandable if a bit disappointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can preorder the Lynky via its Indiegogo campaign now. The preorder price is a reasonable $100, which roughly converts to £75 or AU$130 for our readers in the UK and Australia. Preorders will start shipping at the beginning of 2018. At retail, the Lynky will still be an affordable $150 (about £110 or AU$200).\n",

Before contributing to any campaign, read the crowdfunding site's policies -- in this case, Indiegogo -- to find out your rights (and refund policies, or the lack thereof) before and after a campaign ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lynky might not have the video-calling features of the Amazon Echo Show, but I still like the idea of a Google Home with a touchscreen, and throwing a smart home hub into that combination is a nice touch.\n",
      "Guardzilla 360\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DIY security camera maker Guardzilla today introduced a new indoor camera that wants to give you a complete view of what's happening in your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Guardzilla 360 captures a continuous panoramic live video feed thanks to its 360-degree camera. That's unique for DIY home security cameras, most of which are either fixed-angle (usually capturing up to a 180-degree field of view) or pan-tilt-zoom-style, which might let you rotate the camera 360 degrees, but you can't view 360 degrees all at once. Instead, the Guardzilla app gives you free rein to pan around an entire room in real time (and in 1,712x1,712-pixel resolution) to see what's going on in day or night vision mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the startup's two existing cameras, which retail for just 100 bucks each, the $230 Guardzilla 360 is a premium all-in-one home security system. The 360 has all of the basics you'd expect from a standalone security device along with its panoramic video -- a motion sensor, free clip-based video storage, a 100-decibel siren, remote arming and disarming and geofencing capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardzilla also claims improved \"full-duplex\" two-way talk with its 360 cam thanks to an integrated microphone and speaker. Full-duplex means both sides can talk at the same time, rather than having to wait for the person on the other end to finish. The camera also works with Amazon and Google voice control speakers, as well as Nest, IFTTT and Samsung's SmartThings.\n",
      "\n",
      "We haven't seen anything quite like the Guardzilla 360 camera, particularly for just $230. The closest competitor we've tested is the IC Real Tech Allie Home, a $600 360-degree DIY camera that works with a VR headset but offers no real home security benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Guarzilla 360 is available now in the United States at Target, Best Buy and other major retailers. I'll be testing it out over the next few days, so look for a full review soon. In the meantime, check out the below video of Guardzilla's inaugural product, the $100 indoor Guardzilla cam.\n",
      "Cherry Labs Cherry Home\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Startup security company Cherry Labs wants its system of cameras with built-in sensors to be the eyes and ears of your smart home. The system, called Cherry Home, uses a separate processor and advanced AI to not only see what's going on, but map the room it's in, recognize the people in the room, tell you what they're doing, and notify you if something goes wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cherry Labs and Cherry Home officially launch today. The company will ship out its first 100 Cherry Home units in February. Those customers will still technically be beta-testing the product. The next 1,000 units will roll out in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've seen cams with some level of AI before. The Netatmo Welcome ($131.99 at Amazon.com) and the Nest Cam IQ recognize faces. An upcoming cam called Lighthouse can even distinguish actions and notify you if someone is running.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambitious Cherry Home smart home system promises capabilities well beyond what any of its competitors can do. That's because Cherry Home won't just use facial recognition to tell who's who. The cam also learns the length of your arms and legs, the clothes you wear, the sound of your voice, the color of your skin and hair, and even the way you walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cherry Home triangulates its position in the room through a variety of sensors and creates a diagram of the space you can see on the app. Thanks to all of the info it tracks, the Cherry Home knows who's in the room, where that person is within the room, and what they're doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "At launch, Cherry Labs promises that its system will send an alert when a person falls down. The system will also know if someone is screaming, crying or just laughing. Cherry Labs service will include professional monitoring, so if the system senses something wrong, it can call emergency services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the future, Cherry Labs wants to offer even more advanced smarts. For example, you could tie it into your smart home so it could automatically turn on your reading light when you open a book. And the coolest innovation is still a work in progress for the team but could be a significant step forward for the actual smarts of the smart home -- Cherry Labs is working with pharmaceutical companies to understand the body language of a person when they're about to have a stroke. The company isn't promising this feature any time soon, but at some point, this smart home cam could recognize when you're in the early stages of a stroke and call 911.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make all of this happen, Cherry Home's cams pack in a bunch of sensors: It has a binocular camera with a 165-degree field of view and an infrared sensor for night vision. Each cam also includes a motion sensor, an accelerometer, a compass and an altimeter so it knows how high it is off the ground and which way it's facing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cams send all of the data they collect to a central processor with the computing power of a high-end PC, according to Cherry Labs. That processor will save and analyze all data locally to increase turnaround time on its responsiveness and for added privacy. The cams and processor talk to each other using a mesh Wi-Fi network. The processor only talks to the cloud when it needs to send you an alert or if you're using an app to watch a live feed from a room.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll be able to customize alerts and when you want Cherry Labs to save clips. You'll get a daily summary of the activities it spotted and who it saw. And the processor has a backup battery should the power fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cams are battery powered by coin batteries that last about three months. Fortunately, the processor can recharge those batteries, and houses two extra, so you can swap in those once a quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Cherry Labs is promising smarts well beyond what's currently available, I'm skeptical that Cherry Home will ever be a reliable consumer product you can pick up at your local electronics store. Even the more limited facial recognition in cams like the Netatmo Welcome is hit-or-miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as you might have expected, the Cherry Home's price will be prohibitive for curious smart-home shoppers. A starter pack of two sensors and a processor will be $900. A pack with four sensors will cost $1,200. An eight-pack kit is $1,400. (Cherry Home will ship overseas. The US prices convert to approximately £680/AU$1,150 for a two-pack, £900/AU$1,500 for four, and £1,000/AU$1,800 for eight.)\n",
      "\n",
      "For comparison, a Nest Cam IQ can work on its own without a processor and costs $300. Cherry Labs will also charge $14 per month per sensor for its insights and monitoring (£10/AU$18), or $10 per month per sensor if you sign up for a full year (£8/AU$13). You can still use the cams as cams without this subscription, but you lose almost all of the AI advantages. Nest's AI service, called Nest Aware, starts at $10 per month, but doesn't include monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also have privacy concerns about Cherry Home. The cams don't have a physical shutter, so you can't manually keep it from keeping an eye on you short of killing its power.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Cherry Home's promised features sound possible given all of its sensors and the computing power of a high-end PC. It might also be more reliable than the facial recognition we've seen simply because it's not just relying solely on facial recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, the company is being upfront about what it'll be able to do from the start and what it's hoping for in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, Cherry Home isn't for you if you're looking for an affordable and simple upgrade to your home's security. If you want to preorder Cherry Home, get ready to live on the cutting edge, for better and for worse. That said, I'm fascinated by Cherry Labs' ambitious goals. If the company can pull off all of its lofty promises, the AI of Cherry Home could act as the brain of a more proactive smart home.\n",
      "Amazon Echo\n",
      "                                    2017\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Three years after the debut of the original, Amazon decided the time was right to refresh its flagship smart speaker, the voice-activated Amazon Echo. Generation two arrives to find a landscape littered with new competitors -- not just the Google Home, but also Apple's upcoming HomePod, the platform-agnostic Sonos One, the Cortana-powered Invoke from Harman Kardon and countless others.\n",
      "\n",
      "At $100 -- nearly half the cost of the original -- the new Echo seeks to undercut them all. Like its predecessor, it doesn't offer premium audio quality, but it's still strong enough to fill a room with decent sound. And, if you like, you can connect it with your existing audio setup using either Bluetooth or a 3.5mm cable, something you can't do with the original. It looks better than before, too, with an attractive and compact new design and a variety of new, interchangeable \"shells\" to choose from.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, the new Echo isn't any smarter than the first one -- it does everything the original does, and the original does everything it does, save for connecting with external speakers. That list of capabilities continues to grow, though, thanks to a regular roll-out of skills, software updates and integrations with third-party gadgets and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, it's the same Alexa speaker that quickly became a dominant smash hit, only now it's cheaper and nicer-looking. And here come the holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Amazon Echo is shorter than the original, and it comes in a variety of new \"shells\" that each give it a unique look. By default, you get a grey fabric shell in your choice of shades: sandstone (light), charcoal (dark) or heather (in between). Spend an extra $20, and your Echo can come in a hard-bodied silver shell, or a woodgrain shell in oak or walnut.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my tastes, the woodgrain shells clash with the black plastic top and blue indicator lights, so I'd probably just stick with fabric. If I changed my mind down the line, I could mix things up and swap that fabric shell out for a different one just as easily as swapping out the case on my phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do so, you just push up through a hole in the bottom of the shell to force the inside of the speaker out -- sort of like a Push Pop. Then, you slide the speaker down into its new shell and twist to lock it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "With its newly squat stature and interchangeable shells, Amazon's new speaker seems aimed at shoring up the Echo's pitch against Google Home, its chief competitor. The two speakers are now roughly the same size, and you can swap out the base coverings on each of them. Matching it on both fronts makes it tougher for customers to pick Google over Amazon because they prefer the design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the other interesting note on the second-gen Echo -- it's almost more of a follow-up to the Echo Dot than anything else. Not only does it borrow the Echo Dot's aux out jack and emphasis on compact design, but it also ditches the original Echo's volume ring in favor of volume buttons, just like the Echo Dot did (if you have a strong preference for that volume ring, you can still get it with the $150 Echo Plus).\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget that the original Echo Dot cost $90 before Amazon cut the price to $50 for the follow-up. With its price cut from $180 down to $100, the new Echo is following the exact same formula -- and why wouldn't it? The second-gen Echo Dot is Amazon's best-selling Alexa gadget -- for now, at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the original? To my ear, it sounds about the same -- maybe a bit less tinny.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important part is that the new Echo hits a sweet spot between affordability and sound quality. Setting aside the portable, battery-powered offshoots and the oddball third-party devices like GE's Alexa lamp, we've seen three tiers emerge in the smart speaker category. The first, which includes the Google Home Mini and the Echo Dot, is made up of pint-sized, low-cost speakers that focus on the smarts and leave sound quality as an after-thought. At the other end of the spectrum, you've got premium-priced smart speakers like the Google Home Max and the Apple HomePod that promise high-fidelity audio above all else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the original, the Echo sits right in the middle, squarely between bad and great. Casual listeners will likely call that good (or good enough, at least). If you're an audiophile, you'll want something richer-sounding, but you also probably already have a setup you're happy with. If that sounds like you, just get an Echo Dot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Echo compares favorably against other speakers that sit in that same middle ground. The main competitor is the Google Home smart speaker, and for my money, the new Echo sounds noticeably more powerful. Competitors from that premium tier like the HomePod, the Google Home Max, the Sonos One and the Invoke from Harman Kardon will all likely offer a noticeable uptick in sound quality -- but all of them also cost at least twice as much as the new Echo.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other note on sound quality: in November of 2017, Amazon issued a firmware update that tweaked the new Echo's equalizer settings to give it deeper-sounding bass. Some users report fuller-sounding music playback since the update, while others think that the boosted bass might be muddying the mix a little bit. As for me, I ran my tests again and really couldn't hear much of a difference at all. At any rate, your mileage will vary based on what music you're listening to, and how loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also made sure to test out the new Echo's microphones. Amazon tells us that they're better than before, with second-gen far-field technology, better wake word processing and enhanced noise cancellation. I didn't notice much of a difference between the two Echoes when I tested them out. Both struggled as expected to hear me over loud music, and both occasionally needed me to raise my voice when music was playing at more moderate volumes (the same can be said of the Google Home). The new Echo did seem noticeably better at hearing me from a distance in quiet conditions, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "\" data-image-credit=\"Tyler Lizenby/CNET\" data-image-alt-text=\"echo-2-product-photos-16\" data-image-filename=\"echo-2-product-photos-16.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2017/10/20\" data-image-width=\"5120\" data-image-height=\"3840\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"false\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"false\" data-image-watermark=\"false\" data-lightbox=\"enabled\">\n",
      "\n",
      "That's another interesting thing about the new Echo: It doesn't feel all that new, at least not as far as features are concerned -- and not when you compare it to more creative Alexa offshoots like the fashion-focused Echo Look selfie camera and the upcoming Echo Spot touchscreen alarm clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those offshoot products reflect Amazon's eagerness to make Alexa relevant to as many people as possible. With the Echo, Amazon just wants to be sure it doesn't \"fix\" what isn't broken. The result is a cosmetic and conservative step forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the aux-out jack, the new Echo doesn't boast any new hardware capabilities, nor is it launching with flashy new software or new, marquee skills. Ask the new Echo and the old Echo the same question and they'll each give you the same answer. To borrow some Apple parlance, think of the new Echo as an \"S\" model: a refinement, for sure, but not a redefining one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, Amazon points to the past year's worth of big additions, including calling and messaging, smart entertainment controls, voice recognition and the fact that you can synchronize music playback across multiple Echo devices. The point isn't to get existing Echo owners to upgrade, but to sweeten the deal for anyone who hasn't bought in yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon did take the occasion to give Alexa a tune-up, with a refreshed app and refined smart-home controls that let you control devices such as lights and locks directly from the Alexa app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those controls also let you create \"routines,\" where a single Alexa command can trigger a series of actions in your home. For instance, saying \"Alexa, goodnight\" could lock your smart lock, turn the lights and the TV off, and fire up a bedroom space heater you've plugged into a smart switch.The best part is that you create your own custom Alexa command to trigger the routine. Power users should have a field day with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you'd prefer, you can also schedule your routine to run automatically at a specific time, no Alexa command necessary. More than anything, that feature reflects Amazon's attempts to position the Echo lineup as bonafide smart home hubs -- particularly the $150 Echo Plus, which uses a ZigBee radio to quarterback lights, locks and other smart home gadgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's another improvement for anyone who owns Alexa-friendly smart lights: You can now add each Echo device to a single, default group of lights. To control those lights, just tell that Echo device to \"turn the lights on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grouping your lights and Echos by room is an easy way to make things a little more intuitive. If you tell the Echo in your kitchen to \"turn the lights on,\" it'll turn the lights on in the kitchen. If you tell the Echo Dot in your bedroom to \"turn the lights off,\" it'll turn the lights off in the bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a good, common-sense step in the right direction, but it isn't specific to the new Echo. Like all of the new software features, it applies to the entire Echo lineup, including the original. That means that there's very little reason to upgrade to the new Echo if you're already happy with the old one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep an eye on this space -- I'll be sure to update it regularly as new features arrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been fascinating to watch Alexa's story unfold. With good AI and great product strategy, Amazon has managed to do more than any other company to make voice controls meaningful in our homes -- more than even Apple, which introduced us to Siri years before Alexa came around. And, if the three-year drumbeat of new Alexa features and the slew of new Echo devices on the horizon are any indication, that story is far from finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Amazon Echo, you get to watch that story play out under your roof. Even at three years old, it's a legitimately futuristic product -- a voice-activated computer that turns your home into your very own Star Trek ship. The competition is finally getting interesting, but Amazon is still the one driving the conversation. At its new price of $100, the Echo will be awfully tough to beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "And who knows -- maybe the Echo is obsolete in five years. Maybe smart speakers are just a fad, or a stepping stone to whatever the next big thing is. Who knows. Who cares? Right now, the Echo is a useful, versatile device that does its job well, and Amazon clearly has some pretty big plans for it. Sometimes in tech, it's just fun to be along for the ride.\n",

      "Editor's Note: Updated November 6th, 2017 at 2:30 p.m. ET to add notes on a firmware update from Amazon that promises deeper-sounding bass. We weren't able to notice much of a difference, so the sound quality score remains unchanged at 7.5.\n",

      "Harman Kardon Invoke\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hey, Cortana: What can you do for me that Alexa can't?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the opening question you might want to ask the Harman Kardon Invoke ($199.95 at Amazon Marketplace), a smart speaker that's the first non-Windows PC device powered powered by Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant. While Alexa is tops for smart home integration and shopping, and Google Home ($129.00 at Dell Home) is best for answering deeper AI-powered questions, Cortana -- not surprisingly -- finds her strengths with Office-centric tasks such as calendar queries and Skype calls. And thanks to Harman Kardon's audio pedigree, this speaker sounds great with music, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Invoke was announced months ago, but it's finally available on Oct. 22 for $199. There's no timeframe for UK or Australian availability, but that price converts to about £150 or AU$255.\n",
      "\n",
      "Invoke's design feels high-end, and that's good news for a speaker with a higher price tag than the Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) and Google Home. A metal outer casing comes in Graphite and Pearl/Silver. On the top of the device, a smooth-turning volume control and touchpad act as user interfaces. Like Alexa, a circular light on the top of the device lights up when it hears the wake phrase. In this case, that's \"Hey, Cortana\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft's version of Alexa and Siri is available on Windows 10 and as an app on Android and iOS devices. Cortana can do everything you'd expect, including play music, answer questions, make calls and tell you about your day. Microsoft's focus is on bringing professional productivity into the home. With Office 365 and Outlook connected, you can ask Cortana about your calendar or set reminders that will appear across Cortana-enabled devices. I connected my Outlook account and Cortana answered questions about meeting times, places and participants. But if you're not using those services, that functionality won't work. Cortana couldn't recognize events that were only scheduled in my Gmail calendar. Reading emails aloud or combing through Office 365 documents for keywords isn't in Cortana's current skill set either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Invoke supports calls to mobile phone and landlines via Microsoft's Skype service. In the US, that means Invoke get free nationwide domestic calling. Once you've connected your Skype account in the Cortana app, you'll be able to call anyone from your Skype contacts, phone contacts or a local business. Cortana uses Bing search technology -- yes, the Microsoft corporate family is all here -- to help you find local business numbers. Connect your phone via bluetooth and it's easy to initiate calls with Cortana commands. I was able to call a fellow editor from my phone's contacts, as well as ask Cortana to call the nearest pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike Amazon and Google, Harman Kardon has a long and respected audio lineage, and that's why we had high hopes for the Invoke's sound quality. The speaker has three compact \"woofers,\" three tweeters and two passive radiators. On paper, that's a more formidable driver array than the $99 Echo and even the $399 Google Home Max.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found the Invoke's 360-degree sound to deliver fuller bass and cleaner treble than Amazon's Echo line of speakers. But my colleague Ty Pendlebury compared the Invoke to the $199 Alexa-powered Sonos One ($199.00 at Amazon.com), and found it well matched -- though each speaker had its strengths and weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Adjusting the volume via the turning dial feels good, but it's hard to get a great visual of exactly what volume level you're dialing to with a smoky LED circle. From a distance, it's difficult to see any light notifications, as the light on the very top is the only indicator of Cortana's activity. Seven microphones allow far-field listening and separate pipelines differentiate between audio playback and your voice. That means Cortana can hear you well from a distance and over the speaker's music.\n",
      "\n",
      "Music streaming options are limited for now, though. You'll need Spotify premium in order to ask Cortana to play a specific song. Invoke also works with iHeartRadio and TuneIn, creating or playing stations per your request. With a Spotify premium account, you can ask Cortana to play a specific song. Pandora is not supported, but Harman Kardon says it is working to make it available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart home control is where Invoke starts to lag behind. It currently supports SmartThings, Philips Hue, Nest, Wink and Insteon. That's not a bad start, and it will allow you to control lights, switches, outlets and thermostats. However, I'd like to see that list, as well as Cortana's set of skills, really expand. Harman Kardon say it's working with Honeywell, Ecobee, TP-Link, Johnson Controls, IFTT, Geeni, Iris by Lowe's and iDevices to integrate with Cortana. If those integrations happen soon, Invoke will be a much more viable smart home platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tested the Invoke speaker with the Nest Thermostat E.  Connect your Nest account in the Cortana app and Cortana will adjust the temperature with phrases like \"Hey Cortana, make it warmer\" or \"Hey Cortana set the thermostat to 68 degrees.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We tested Philips Hue's Cortana integration and while it did work well once we connected, that account connection process was significantly buggier. It took re-pairing the Hue bridge with a new e-mail in order to get things up and running. Once connected, Cortana can to turn on individual lights or a specific room, depending on what you've built in the Hue app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the most interesting part of Invoke's debut is Amazon and Microsoft's announcement of future Alexa and Cortana interoperability. In August, both companies stated that by the end of 2017, you'll be able to open one virtual assistant with the other by saying \"Alexa, open Cortana\" or vice versa. From there, you would be able to interact with Alexa or Cortana-specific skills. This supposedly symbiotic relationship looks to fill in the gaps for one another, giving Alexa users the ability to tap into Office 365, Outlook and other Cortana productivity skills. Is that something consumers will welcome? Microsoft and Amazon certainly think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Invoke gets Microsoft and Harman Kardon going in the right direction. Factor in a growing set of skills and brand integrations, and the Invoke is on the right track. But the competition here is formidable: Alexa-powered speakers -- Amazon's own Echoes, plus Sonos and Ultimate Ears -- are on fire, Google's ramping up with new Home models and Apple's HomePod is just weeks away.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that environment, it's hard to tell someone to run out and get the Invoke. On the other hand, the speaker's superior sound quality and the promise of additional smart home compatibilities and -- especially -- that forthcoming Alexa tie-up make this Cortana-enabled speaker one that we'll be revisiting soon.\n",
      "HOPii\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A new automatic beer brewer called the HOPii wants to claim the middle ground between beer brewing machines like the PicoBrew and a simple at-home tap such as the Fizzics. And home brewers seem ready for the HOPii's easy approach to brewing: The product has raised more than $371,000 from 362 backers on Kickstarter, leaping over its initial crowdfunding goal of $50,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the push of a button, the HOPii whips up a batch of fresh brew with a process that thankfully doesn't involve anything gross, like making beer from concentrate. The HOPii's creators take care of the first two steps of beer brewing (the mash and the boil), which creates unfermented beer called wort. The company will send you an ingredient pack with a big bottle of wort, a packet of yeast and any extras you need to finish the recipe. Then, you put everything in place and hit start, and the HOPii takes care of the rest. You'll even be able pour the beer from the HOPii's built-in tap when the beer is finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The HOPii allows you to drink freshly made beer while getting around the strict guidelines for shipping alcoholic liquid from state to state (the fermentation step is what makes wort alcoholic). In theory, this would let you try beers from brewers that don't distribute to your area. However, the HOPii will begin with an offering of only 12 recipes -- all made by the HOPii team. Company reps say they're working on adding partnerships with other breweries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The HOPii unit is temperature-controlled and recognizes the type of beer you're brewing from the bottle of wort. Supposedly, it creates the ideal fermentation conditions for that type of beer, and it can clean and sanitize itself when you're done brewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main concern with the HOPii's approach is that it goes against the common brewing practice of introducing your yeast to your wort as soon as possible. The sugars in wort are purposely primed to react with yeast, so wort can easily get infected if something in the air starts reacting with those sugars first. With the HOPii, the volatile wort is shipped and could be in the container for weeks before you put it into the machine and start fermenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rep from HOPii reassured me that they've worked with multiple third-party labs on quality control. The wort containers are airtight and block out light as well, and they have a shelf life of up to a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can preorder the HOPii on Kickstarter now for a discount. The first machines are scheduled to ship worldwide in the summer of 2018. Once the final product is ready, the HOPii will be available on Amazon and will ship in time for the 2018 holidays. The retail price will be a hefty $600, which converts to approximately £450 and AU$750. Ingredient packs will be $20 to $30 a piece (£15/£20 and AU$25/AU$40) and will produce 3 liters of beer. That measures out to about eight glasses of beer per batch, so roughly $3 for each 12-ounce glass you drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a lot to spend on a beer gadget, but it's not as much as the $800 PicoBrew Pico. Still, I'd hope the HOPii will offer a greater variety of brews by the time the product is finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain Kickstarter backers can also use the HOPii to ferment their homebrew recipes in precisely controlled conditions. That'd be a great extra if HOPii rolled it out to the final product, but for now, the company is only offering it on preordered machines.\n",
      "Remo+ DoorCam\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Remo+, formerly known as Olive & Dove, is back with a new DIY home security device: the DoorCam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DoorCam is a $199 battery-powered door-mounted outdoor camera. Available for preorder on the Remo+ online store, DoorCams are expected to ship later in October. Remo+ will start shipping DoorCams internationally later in 2017; at the current exchange rate, $199 converts to roughly £150 and AU$250.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what can a DoorCam do? Here's what Remo+ has to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "Remo+ hasn't yet responded with the particulars of its video clip storage or whether the DoorCam has night vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really intrigued by this concept. Plenty of folks won't like the idea of having a security camera essentially draping over their front door (installation looks simple, though -- roughly the same as installing an over-the-door hook or storage rack).\n",
      "\n",
      "Its unique design addresses (and potentially solves) a major issue with Wi-Fi-enabled outdoor camera installations: poor connectivity. Hanging the camera's Wi-Fi chipset and antenna inside the door and the camera outside, Remo+ says, reduces interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes sense, but we'll have to try it out for ourselves to know for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indoor/outdoor; fits over \"any residential door\" Wi-Fi-enabled; the Wi-Fi module and antenna sit on the inside of the door720p high-definition live-streaming cameraBattery-powered; three D batteries with up to 12 months of expected lifePassive infrared motion sensor to distinguish between people and everything elsePush alertsSaved video clips Two-way audio\n",
      "GardenSpace\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like other smart plant sensors, GardenSpace knows when your flowers need a drink. Debuting Tuesday on Kickstarter, this tall garden sentry goes a couple of steps beyond the norm by actually watering your plants for you and spraying away pests.\n",
      "\n",
      "GardenSpace looks over your garden during the day and takes pics to monitor the health of your plants and water them as necessary. You can use the app to tell GardenSpace what you're growing, and get more detailed care advice as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining info from an infrared thermometer, an infrared camera and a normal RGB cam mounted on the front of its rotating head, GardenSpace calculates the water stress levels and the general health of your garden. It can monitor up to 100 square feet -- providing customized care to any plant in that radius.\n",
      "\n",
      "At night, GardenSpace doubles as a sentry, and uses its motion sensors to watch for and ward away critters with a spray of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's solar-powered with a backup battery for a cloudy day, and it's pretty easy to set up -- stake it in the ground and attach an ordinary hose. I got to see GardenSpace in action and it's taller than I expected -- it came up to my waist. That height gives it a bird's eye view of the action and the proper angle to spray water anywhere in its radius.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app wasn't ready for a demo yet. Supposedly, it'll be able to walk you through any extra care steps you need to give your plant and will also be able to give advice about what to grow and when to plant it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I certainly like the idea of a smart garden gadget that will take the day-to-day maintenance and guesswork off of my plate. Plus, GardenSpace doubles as a kind of security guard for your garden, so if it fulfills its promises, it'll be much more of an active aid in your quest for a green thumb than the other plant sensors we've tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "GardenSpace will start shipping to Kickstarter backers at this time next year. You can preorder it now at a discount. At retail, the sensor have a hefty $400 price tag -- so it'll need to live up to its potential to be worth that kind of splurge. GardenSpace will be available internationally, and the US price converts to approximately £300 and AU$500.\n",
      "Sylvania Smart Plus Zigbee LED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Timing is everything. Just weeks after Amazon announced a new \"Echo Plus\" smart speaker with a built-in Zigbee radio for direct control of Zigbee smart home gadgets, Ledvance is introducing a new line of low-cost Sylvania Smart Plus Zigbee lights starting at just $12 each.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, at $12, the A-shaped 60W replacement is one of the most affordable big-brand smart bulbs we've seen. $15 for a smart BR30 floodlight and $20 for a weatherproof PAR38 floodlight are good deals, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most exciting part (at least for smart lighting nerds like me) might be that $20 PAR38-shaped bulb. People ask me all the time for a smart floodlight they can use outdoors that doesn't cost too much, and there aren't a lot of good options out there. Sylvania's bulb should fill the void nicely.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three are decent light bulbs in their own right, too. In terms of brightness, the A-shaped bulb promises the standard 800 lumens that you'd expect from a 60W replacement. Our spectrometer measured it at 837 lumens, with a soft white color temperature of 2,740 K, which is just what you want. With 813 lumens, the BR30-shaped bulb came in brighter than advertised, too. I measured the PAR38 bulb at 1,024 lumens -- just shy of the stated 1,050 lumens, but well within our setup's 5 percent margin of error. In short, all three earn a passing grade as far as specs are concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you aren't familiar, Zigbee is a wireless protocol that devices can use to communicate with each other, just like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It's the same protocol used by Philips Hue smart bulbs and by a wide range of other lights, locks and smart home gadgets. The only catch is that most routers don't speak Zigbee, so you'll need a Zigbee-fluent control hub like the Echo Plus ($149.99 at Amazon.com), the Philips Hue Bridge, the Wink Hub, the SmartThings Hub or Sylvania's own plug-in gateway to act as translator.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is that you'll screw the Sylvania Smart Plus bulb in and turn it on, then connect it with a hub like one of those. From there, you'll be able to control it remotely using your phone, or schedule automated lighting changes. The specific types of automations available will depend on what hub you're using -- for instance, some simply let you program times for the bulbs to come on and off, while others will also let you sync them up with motion detectors or schedule slow fades to help ease you out of bed in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrations will vary from hub to hub, too. Whether it's Alexa or Nest, Apple HomeKit or Google Home, your hub will determine what platforms your bulbs work with (fortunately, our handy CNET Compatibility Tracker can help you sort out what works with what).\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever Zigbee hub you're using, the bottom line is that these new Sylvania bulbs will likely work with it, and they won't cost you very much compared with other connected bulbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other note: Things are a little bit jumbled with Sylvania's branding these days. Walk through the lighting aisle at your local hardware store, and you might see bulbs and lighting products under the names Sylvania, Osram, Lightify and Ledvance -- all of which look alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's confusing, I know,\" a Ledvance spokesperson admitted, so I asked him for a quick rundown:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ledvance is our company name,\" he explained. \"We used to be a part of the company Osram, which owns the Lightify app, gateway and brand.  We separated from Osram last July.  Ledvance sells Sylvania general lighting products in the US and Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are hoping to simplify things by moving our smart lighting products to the Sylvania Smart Plus brand,\" he added, before also pointing out that Sylvania's Zigbee bulbs will work with the existing Osram Lightify plug-in gateway.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Sylvania Smart Plus lineup also includes other kinds of smart lights, including bulbs that work with Apple HomeKit. These Zigbee bulbs do not, but they share the same \"Sylvania Smart Plus\" branding. At any rate, you'll want to make sure you're buying the right light before you pull the trigger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sylvania's new Zigbee lineup is available today on Amazon, and will roll out to major retailers in the weeks ahead. We'll test them out with as many Zigbee hubs as we can out at the CNET Smart Home -- stay tuned for an update.\n",
      "igloohome Smart Deadbolt 02\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Singapore-based startup igloohome released its second generation deadbolt this year. The Deadbolt 02 is a sleek and simple bluetooth deadbolt with a keypad and physical key. If you're looking for a Bluetooth lock with a touchscreen keypad, the $199 Deadbolt 02 is a sensible choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Deadbolt 02 works via Bluetooth, turning your phone into a Bluetooth key. The touchscreen keypad locks and unlocks your door with a PIN. Having both of these options makes the Deadbolt 02 a valid alternative to using a traditional unconnected lock. You can still access your home with a physical key, though you will need a sharp object to depress a button on a rather flimsy-feeling plastic cover to reveal the keyhole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation is simple enough. Instructions aren't included in the box, but they are available on the app or igloohome's website. Four AA batteries power the lock, and you'll receive notifications when they're running low. If you find yourself locked out of the house with the lock's batteries dead, you can jump start the lock with a 9V battery and two nodes built into the base of the lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The igloohome app, available on Google Play and the App Store, manages most major features of the lock. From here, you can set individual PINs or send Bluetooth keys to friends and family. You can also view battery life, schedule temporary PINs and see an activity log. The Deadbolt 02 system allows up to 285 active PINs at a time. Once you've reached the maximum, you'll need to clear your PIN list to add more.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Airbnb Connect feature currently free and in beta testing syncs with your Airbnb calendar and auto-generates a PIN for each scheduled guest. Once the beta testing phase is complete, this service will cost $5 per lock per month. To me, that seems like a big price tag for something I could probably manage myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Igloohome put in the work to make this deadbolt secure. A tamper alarm sounds if someone tries to pry the lock from the door. Decoy numbers give you the option to enter up to eight digits before your real PIN. This keeps intruders from guessing your PIN by studying the smudged fingerprints you'll inevitably put on the glossy keypad. A security lockout feature stops the lock from operating for five minutes if an invalid PIN is entered five times.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest disappointment with the Deadbolt 02 was app functionality. It's not possible to lock the deadbolt from the app, and I found myself wishing I could lock the door the same way I unlocked it. To lock it without a physical key you have three options: hold down the # sign on the keypad, turn the physical knob on the inside of the door or set up igloohome's timed re-lock feature. With timed re-lock, the deadbolt will lock anywhere from five seconds to 120 seconds after it's unlocked, depending on the amount of time you've specified. The re-lock feature is set up by entering a series of digits into the keypad, but I really wish it were managed through the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also found it disappointing that you can't view lock status in the app. It works more like a remote control than a monitoring tool. An \"easy unlock\" feature currently in beta mode, only removes the need to tap the unlock button in the app. You'll still need to have the app open to unlock the door. This means you're still pulling out your phone and opening an app to access your home. Thankfully, the problems presented by the app are easily solved by using the keypad. Entering my PIN proved to be the fastest way to open the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other smart locks ($150.00 at Amazon.com) like the third generation $150 August Smart Lock offer more features. Add a $79 Wi-Fi module to that lock or the August Smart Lock Pro, and you'll get Alexa, Google and Nest compatibility along with the ability to control your lock from anywhere via the app. While the Deadbolt 02 doesn't offer a Wi-Fi module, Zigbee or Z-Wave compatibility, it does give you a great looking keypad, Bluetooth keys for visitors and a physical key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Igloohome's Deadbolt 02 is available on the igloohome website, Amazon and other online retailers for $199. Sleek and simple to use, this deadbolt is a good fit for anyone looking for a keypad lock with simple Bluetooth functionality.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Wi-Fi-enabled refrigerators will send alerts to your phone if you leave a door open, when you need to replace a filter and if there are power outages. You'll also be able to adjust your freezer and refrigerator temperatures when you're away.\n",

      "The refrigerators, along with Kenmore's other smart appliances, work with Alexa thanks to a Skill called Kenmore Smart. If you have one of the appliances and an Alexa-enabled smart speaker, you enable the Kenmore Smart Skill within the Alexa app and link your accounts.

      "Philips 60W Replacement WarmGlow Clear LED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-cost, high-efficiency LED light bulbs are now more norm than exception in your local lighting aisle, and that means manufacturers are starting to get creative in order to stand out. One good example: the \"WarmGlow\" line of dimmable LEDs from Philips. Dim each one's brightness, and the color temperature will fall with it, changing from a bright, yellowy 2,700 K to an orange, candle-like glow.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a subtle effect that's intended to mimic the color of an old-school incandescent filament, so it only made sense for Philips to trot the feature out in a bulb with an old-school design. That bulb, the clear glass version of the Philips 60W Replacement WarmGlow LED, sells in a two-pack at Home Depot stores for a little less than $12.\n",
      "\n",
      "A price of $6 per bulb is basically the average going rate for a dimmable 60-watt replacement LED these days, so you're not paying a premium for that WarmGlow dimming. Even if WarmGlow leaves you cold, the bulb's specs are solid enough to make the bulb a good value in its own right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only real issue with the bulb is that its faux-filament build means that the light it puts out includes some potentially ugly shadows. Each \"filament\" is actually just a bunch of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged in a column. Some of those little columns of light face inward, which means they cast shadows of the other columns sitting in their way. A similar bulb from GE had the same problem, though not as pronounced as with the WarmGlow LED.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe that's supposed to be part of the old-fashioned effect, but to me, it makes for an unpleasant spread of light -- especially when the bulb shines from under a lampshade.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fairness, people probably aren't going to buy this bulb just to hide it under a lampshade (and if they are, they should just get the standard WarmGlow LED without the old-fashioned design). Those fake filaments are really meant for exposed bulb fixtures, where you might want a more nostalgic-looking bulb, even if it comes with a couple of shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old-school WarmGlow LED compares favorably to the original. Like that bulb, it shines brighter than the stated 800 lumens, coming in at 855 lumens when I tested it out (I clocked the original at 838 lumens). You get that light from a power draw of 8.5 watts -- one watt less than the original. More light from less power? Sounds good to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, at 855 lumens, the bulb is putting out over 100 lumens per watt, which is very, very good as far as efficiency is concerned. Use it for 3 hours per day, on average, and it'll add about a buck to your yearly energy bill. By comparison, an actual old-school 60W incandescent will add about $7 to your yearly bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means that if you upgrade to the WarmGlow LED, it'll pay for itself in a year, then continue shining for another decade or so. Philips clocks the expected lifespan at 13.7 years, and backs that up with a three-year warranty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the specs aren't perfect. Other LEDs from names like Cree and Osram offer warranties as long as 10 years, and many competitors promise lifespans almost twice as long as the WarmGlow LED's. The bulb is also pretty average at color rendering, leaving a predictably yellow haze over things instead of making colors and whites look vivid and true.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does well on dimmer switches, though, which is important given how central dimming is to this bulb's appeal. I was able to dial it smoothly down to zero on every switch I tested it on, and never noticed any issues with flicker or buzz. The light showed a very slight stutter as I dimmed it up and down on an old rotary dial designed for incandescents, but it still looked steady at all settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the WarmGlow LED is a bit of a novelty, but a perfectly good light bulb in its own right. You've got a lot of great options in the lighting aisle these days, but if you like the vintage-style looks of faux-filament bulbs like this one (and if you can tolerate those shadows), then the WarmGlow LED is a pretty decent pick at $6 each.\n",
      "August Doorbell Cam Pro\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The $199 Doorbell Cam Pro (roughly £155/AU$266 converted) is August's second-gen smart buzzer. With solid HD livestreaming, motion alerts, two-way audio and integration with Nest and Amazon Alexa, the Doorbell Cam Pro is competitive with Ring and SkyBell models. Almost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of offering night vision like its competition, this doorbell has an integrated LED floodlight to assist in low-light conditions. While this allows you to view the feed in color rather than gray scale, the video quality isn't as good as what you'd get with night vision. August also charges $5 per month for its cloud storage service. Ring's subscription is just $3 per month and SkyBell offers free cloud storage. And, at nearly 3 inches wide, this square August buzzer won't easily fit on a standard door frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, August's Doorbell Cam Pro is a very good option -- especially if you want to use it with an August Smart Lock or Smart Lock Pro. If you don't, consider Ring's Video Doorbell 2 or the SkyBell HD instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Doorbell Cam Pro's price is in-line with Ring's Video Doorbell 2 and the SkyBell HD, it has lower video resolution, a narrower field of view and a higher cloud storage fee. It also relies on integrated LEDs to provide light at night. The floodlight ensures that you can view your video in color rather than traditional night vision's gray scale, but the video clarity suffered somewhat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kuna and Toucan outdoor security cameras work similarly. Designed as porch light cameras, they borrow light from whatever bulb you're using instead of night vision tech. As a result, the quality of the live video feed often struggles in low-light conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "August's Android and iOS app makes it easy to install and set up your Doorbell Cam Pro. Simply download the app on your device of choice and follow the step-by-step instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app will ask you what device you want to install and take you straight into the configuration process. Note: August wants you to connect your Doorbell Cam Pro to your local Wi-Fi network before you install it outside. Plug the included USB-compatible dock into a wall outlet and set your doorbell on it. A white pulsing light should appear; if it doesn't press the \"reset\" button on the back of the doorbell's faceplate.\n",
      "\n",
      "From there, you'll be instructed to both name your doorbell and the house where you installed it -- I named our doorbell \"Front Door\" and the house \"CNET Smart Home.\" You'll then enter your Wi-Fi details and begin installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go back to your doorbell and give it a try to make sure everything's properly connected. If your chime sounds, you're ready to start using your doorbell. Keep in mind that the Doorbell Cam Pro only works with mechanical chimes; digital chimes and intercom systems aren't supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure if your buzzer wiring will work? Find out more here.\n",
      "\n",
      "August's $199 Doorbell Cam Pro performed well throughout testing. The app is easy to navigate, the settings are easy to customize and the live feed and related motion alerts are responsive. Connecting the Doorbell Cam Pro to an Amazon Echo Show speaker is simple, too. Open the Alexa app, search for the August Smart Home skill (not to be confused with the August Home skill, which is exclusively for August smart locks). Select enable, enter login information for your August account and then say, \"Alexa, show me the front door/whatever you named your doorbell.\" That way, you can view your camera's live feed on a slightly bigger screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also pair an August Smart Lock Pro or August Smart Lock to your doorbell so you can lock/unlock the door straight from the app's live screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "August's $199 Doorbell Cam Pro is a good buzzer, made even better if you have a compatible August lock to add to the equation. If you don't, the Doorbell Cam Pro isn't the best choice. It has a lower resolution, a smaller field of view and a pricier cloud subscription than Ring and SkyBell. It's also the widest smart buzzer I've tested and its floodlight didn't work quite as well as traditional night vision technology. Consider the Ring Video Doorbell 2, SkyBell HD or even the $249 Ring Video Doorbell Pro if you're on the fence.\n",
      "Netgear Arlo Pro 2\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear, maker of the Arlo series of DIY home security cameras, is back with a new model -- the Arlo Pro ($221.44 at Amazon.com) 2. Like its predecessors, the Arlo Pro 2 is an indoor/outdoor camera that requires a base station to operate. Existing Arlo customers with a compatible base station can purchase standalone Pro 2 cameras for $220 each. Two- and four-camera kits are also available with a base station included for $480 and $800.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arlo Pro 2 will be sold internationally. Prices convert to roughly £170 and AU$280 for a single camera, £365/AU$615 for the two-camera kit and £610/AU$1,025 for the four-camera kit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the Pro 2's main features:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arlo Pro 2 also works with IFTTT, Wink, Samsung's SmartThings, and Alexa. If you have an Amazon Fire TV Stick, you can ask Alexa to display a video feed of your front door/backyard/garage entrance camera on your TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear also tells me its Arlo Pro 2 is \"more responsive to motion.\" Its motion sensor is apparently in an \"always on\" mode in low power, so it can capture the seconds leading up to a motion event in addition to the event itself. How many seconds it records leading up to a motion event will vary depending on whether your camera is connected to an adapter or relying on battery power. The same goes for activity zones and optional 24/7 cloud recording; the Arlo Pro 2 has to be wired for these to work (and you'll need an Arlo subscription for continuous cloud recording).\n",
      "\n",
      "Click here to read more about Netgear's available subscription plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm intrigued by the upgrade from 720 to 1080p, as well as the option to use it as a wired camera (in addition to the standard battery option). The base station seems unnecessary, though. It does have a built-in siren to act as an added security feature, but it doesn't appear to offer much benefit otherwise. Netgear says it's a \"battery booster,\" which could prove particularly useful since the Pro 2 supports 1080p video (and could drain your battery faster as a result).\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear's original Arlo camera was among the first battery-powered indoor/outdoor models available on the DIY market. Rated for wind, rain and cold weather, the 720p HD Arlo cam ($196.00 at Amazon.com) is highly capable. But, it requires expensive and hard to find CR123 batteries. You can still buy the Arlo camera starting at $180/£200/AU$277 for a one-camera kit, plus a first-gen base station.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear then introduced the Arlo Pro, a camera very similar to the first-gen model, except that it's equipped with a rechargeable lithium ion battery. The Pro model will also continue to be sold for $250/£300/AU$499.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart home security systems are an ever-increasing market, and you have a lot to consider before declaring allegiance. Vivint's Smart Home is a good option for a monitored smart home with no long-term contracts. The $550 starter kit price tag isn't outrageous, but be prepared to pay at least $40 monthly for security monitoring, app control and other features that are pretty much mandatory for your system to have any smarts. Compatibility with Amazon's Alexa, Google Home and Nest thermostats makes Vivint's platform a solid choice, as long as you know what you're getting into.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivint's starter kit includes a touchscreen SkyControl panel and choice of six smart sensors. Take your pick of door/window sensors, motion detector, glass break detector, flood/freeze sensors, smoke detector or carbon monoxide detector.\n",
      "\n",
      "From there, you can add additional devices a la carte. Additional door/window sensors, for example, cost $35. Vivint's products also work with the Nest Thermostat and you can purchase this and an Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) as part of your Vivint package.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tested several of Vivint's products at the CNET Smart Home where Rich, our Vivint Smart Home pro, installed our devices and ensured everything was running smoothly. Installation is priced at $198, but some promotions waive this fee. We put the system through a host of everyday scenarios with multiple users and schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the center of the Vivint suite of products is the 7-inch SkyControl panel. This white, wall-mounted control center acts as your home base for every device. Controlling and adjusting all your devices here is pretty straightforward. The panel's size and shape feels a bit clunky, but the interface is simple and easy to navigate. The SkyControl panel can run on backup battery power and a cellular connection, so it will continue to work when your power or Wi-Fi goes out.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're not at home, you can use your Vivint app, a mobile version of the SkyControl panel, for controls and notifications. There's also a four-digit PIN to access the panel for added security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the additional products Vivint offers are a few interesting camera options. With the exception of two AT&T Digital Life plans that cost $55 and $65, most home security starter kits on the market won't include cameras or doorbells. Vivint doesn't include any cameras out of the box, but it does allow you to add devices to the starter kit and essentially create your own package when you sign up. Package prices vary depending on what you buy, but you'll be able to get all the devices you want in one purchase and one installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivint's doorbell camera costs $230 and offers you a first look at the front door. It resembles a normal doorbell, but with an added camera eye and a lighted button that triggers a chime from the SkyControl panel and notifies your mobile app. Two-way talk and one-way video mean you can see and speak to people at the door and they can hear and reply. On-demand live video from the Vivint app allows you to view your front door remotely at any time. The doorbell camera features a 180-degree wide-angle view and good night vision. It also boasts \"smart visitor detection\" so you aren't notified every time a car drives by. However, we did receive several notifications due to one very persistent flying insect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivint offers two additional cameras. The $200 Ping camera, intended for indoor use, and a $300 outdoor camera. What I really like about the Ping camera is two-way talk. You can view the camera's feed and speak to the room's occupants from anywhere via the app. Alternately, anyone in the room with the camera can push a button on top of the camera to call you. The outdoor camera works much like a traditional security camera and you can view it via the app or panel. All three of these cameras include night vision and mobile alerts and record 20-second video clips when motion is detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an additional $10 more a month, your starter Vivint subscription fee turns into the Smart Home Video service plan, which includes 30 days of continuous DVR recording for up to four cameras if you've purchased a 1TB Vivint Smart Drive for $250. While that's very expensive for a 1TB drive, 30-day continuous recording for four cameras is included. The $50-per-month service plan and $249 Smart Drive combo costs $840 for the first year. By comparison, Nest Aware for four cameras will cost $75 per month or $750 for a discounted annual subscription.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purchasing the Vivint Smart Drive isn't mandatory, though. You can purchase cameras and pay just the $50 per month video service plan. That extra $10 per month provides the ability to play back, save, download and share video. Without the Vivint Smart Drive, you'll have access to 10 days of video clips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivint purchased cloud storage startup Space Monkey in 2014, renaming it Vivint Smart Drive. We reviewed the drive when it was still called Space Monkey, and Vivint uses this same distributed cloud storage system for continuous DVR recording with cameras and doorbells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivint's smart home system works with Alexa and Google Assistant. Alexa has a wide skill set of Vivint commands. Beyond basic system arming commands, you can ask if the garage door is closed or tell Alexa to turn down the temperature by 3 degrees. And yes, a Vivint installer will get all that integration up and running for you during the initial setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting consumers to buy in to the professional smart home hasn't been easy. Vivint's recently revised payment options aim to solve the pricing problem that drives so many consumers away from smart home security systems. Vivint Flex Pay, modeled after the cell phone market, works in partnership with Citizens Bank. Customers may purchase a smart home package, including installation, with a zero-percent (0% APR) interest installment loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of the loan, you'll enter into a service agreement priced at $40 per month for Smart Security or $50 per month for Smart Home Video. The service agreement runs the length of your loan, and includes 24/7 professional monitoring with emergency response, cellular connection, 30-day video storage, customer support, in-home service and equipment protection. If you'd prefer to pay for your devices up front, there is a no-contract option.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest downside to the Vivint Smart Home is what you'll lose should you choose to forgo any monthly monitoring. Without monitoring, the system will act as a local alarm only for burglary, fire and other alerts. Emergency services won't be called. The biggest losses, though, are the essentials that make your home feel smart. That's where consumers may start to feel a little pinched.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll lose voice control for Alexa and Google and access to the Vivint app. No app means no mobile alerts, answering the doorbell remotely or viewing your home's camera feeds off-site. No voice control means you must control everything via the SkyControl panel. You also won't receive 24/7 customer support, a warranty for defective products or discounted technician visits past the 90-day free period should any hardware need attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course, there are terms and conditions for moving. Depending on where you are in your agreement, there could be a $99 move fee. If you've been a customer for at least a year and sign a new agreement for your new residence, Vivint will waive the fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're really into commitment and on board with monthly monitoring, Vivint has a solid system here. It offers everything we've come to expect in smart home security and it's compatible with Alexa or Google. Vivint's cameras work well and offer more than a few nice features. However, you've got to play by its rules. If you're not paying at least $40 per month for monitoring services, you'll lose a lot of smart home functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SmartThings and ADT home security system offers no-contract monitoring as well. Even without monitoring, you'll still get notifications on your phone and a control panel that acts as a SmartThings hub. SmartThings and ADT have yet to release any cameras or doorbells for this platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't mind a two-year agreement, AT&T Digital Life includes the most devices and a camera with recorded video a competitively priced $55-per-month package. There's no touchscreen panel, but you can control your system from a tablet or mobile app. Early termination fees can be as high as $840, depending on which package you choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xfinity Home by Comcast is similar to AT&T Digital Life in its two-year agreement structure, and it's cheaper. However, you'll only get a touchscreen panel, three sensors, a motion detector and a keypad in its $25 per month monitored package. Additional thermostats, smart plugs and door/window detectors were also a bit pricier than Vivint's.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't want a long-term contract, Ring's new security system is definitely worth a look. For $10 per month or $100 per year, you'll get 60 days of live and recorded video for an unlimited number of cameras. Those cameras aren't included in the basic security system package, but Ring's doorbells and cameras are competitively priced, starting at $179. Additional sensors and detectors start at $20. Monitoring by Ring is $10 per month. The $199 security kit is available for preorder now and ships in November. You'll get a base, a keypad, two sensors and one motion detector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any way you slice it, a complete smart home security system is pricey. What it really comes down to is if you want monitoring and if you'd like to create your own smart home system. If building your smart home system piece by piece doesn't sound like a fun Friday night, let Vivint install the devices you want, then decide how you'd like to pay and move on with your life. You'll have a solid, professionally monitored system and peace of mind.\n",
      "Lifx Beam\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you can tell that Lifx is betting big on Apple HomeKit support to help sell lots and lots of color-changing lights: In the less than two weeks since that long-awaited support for HomeKit finally went live, the smart lighting manufacturer has unveiled three new products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest is called Lifx Beam, and it's a set of color-changing light bars that you'll stick to your walls to help liven the place up a little. Each bar is about 12 inches long and contains 10 distinct \"zones\" of color that you can control, program, and animate using the Lifx app on your Android, iOS, or Windows device. You get six bars plus a power adapter for $200, AU$280 in Australia, or €230 in Europe and the UK (about £205, converted roughly). Kits ship out this November, Lifx says.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the sounds of it, the Lifx Beam light bars and their amazing Technicolor dreamzones will work a lot like the Lifx Z color-changing light strip. You'll stick both up using 3M sticky tabs, which come included, and connect segments together at their ends to form a continuous line of color-changing light. The only difference: the Lifx Z is flexible, while the Lifx Beam isn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "It still bends, though -- at least, sort of. In addition to the six beams, each starter kit comes with a single, color-changing corner piece that can connect two bars at a 90 degree angle like in the picture shown. Lifx tells me that each power adapter can support up to eight beams and two corner pieces. No word yet on how much an extra beam or corner piece will set you back, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like other Lifx products, the Lifx Beam kit uses Wi-Fi to connect directly to your router, so you don't need any extra hub hardware. It will also work with all three major smart home voice control platforms -- Alexa, Siri and the Google Assistant. You'll also find a Lifx channel on the free, online automation service IFTTT, as well as integrations with other third parties like Logitech and Nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that helps Lifx stay competitive with its color-changing competitors. The closest as far as the Beam is concerned would be Nanoleaf, which already sells a set of triangular, color-changing \"Aurora\" panels that also work with the major voice assistants. No major competitor currently offers stick-up light bars, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the Beam seems like a bit of a niche novelty (which is really saying something in the color-changing smart light category). Folks looking to outfit their smart homes with modern, eye-catching displays will likely be intrigued, but time will tell if that's enough to gin up the sort of sales Lifx is probably hoping for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combined with the Lifx Z strips and with the Lifx Tile wall panels (one of the other new products announced in just the last few days), the brand seems to be expanding its emphasis on decorative lighting. At the very least, the company seems quite comfortable thinking beyond the bulb, which might indicate a potential trend for smart home lighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, you can still stick with Lifx bulbs if you so choose. The newest of which, a lineup of small Lifx Mini bulbs, is set to start shipping by the end of October.\n",
      "Ring Protect\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring is expanding its smart home device lineup with the new Protect security system, announced Monday. The Protect is available for preorder now on Ring's website, as well as at Best Buy and Home Depot in the US. The Ring starter kit costs $199 for a base station, a keypad, a contact sensor, a passive infrared motion sensor and a Z-Wave extender.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Protect's Z-Wave-enabled hub and sensor devices are fairly standard issue for a DIY security system, its $199 starting price is significantly lower  than its direct competition. Google's Nest introduced its own DIY system in September starting at $499 for a hub, two door/window sensors and two arm/disarm key fobs. Samsung's SmartThings and professional security firm ADT also announced their own system Monday, with optional monitoring from, you guessed it, ADT. Its starter kit will set you back $550.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an overview of Ring's Protect:\n",
      "\n",

Available for preorder today on Best Buy and Samsung's websites, the $550 starter kit and $200 expansion pack offer a suite of home security and automation products eligible for professional monitoring by ADT without the strings of a long-term contract. Both kits are expected to be available exclusively at Best Buy stores on Oct. 29.\n",

      "What's in the $200 expansion kit:\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the starter and expansion packs, a key fob remote enables three functions: alarm on, alarm off and panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are no long-term contracts or mandatory service agreements, ADT will monitor what it calls \"life safety\" products, namely those included in the expansion pack, for $15 per month. For $25 per month, ADT will monitor the \"home security\" products in the starter kit for intrusion. An introductory offer gives a $5 discount to customers who purchase both services, making ADT's full service monitoring $35. Customers can cancel or sign up for services at anytime through a corresponding app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite some reliability woes last year, SmartThings feels confident in its metrics and ability to support smart home security. Every device offered in the starter kit functions with 900 MHz dual-encryption wireless technology and is built to the same standards as ADT's professionally installed products. To be monitored by ADT, you must use these specially encrypted devices, which you can also purchase as additional accessories. The 900 MHz system was designed exclusively for this effort. SmartThings and ADT say this encryption will help to safeguard against false alarms that often cost consumers hundreds of dollars in municipal fines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hub of this new security system is the Samsung SmartThings ADT Panel. The 7-inch touchscreen panel works as the main interface for products in the kits, but also functions as a SmartThings hub. This means someone purchasing the starter kit could continue to expand their home automation with any of the current \"works with SmartThings\" products. Zigbee and Z-wave antenna and certification are built into the panel, as well as a siren for alerts. The panel runs on AC power and communicates via Wi-Fi, but includes 7-day battery backup and LTE backup from Verizon wireless, allowing customers to contact ADT in the event of a power outage.\n",
      "\n",
      "SmartThings and ADT are aiming to bridge the gap for consumers (read: millennials) who want to protect and secure their smart home, and be actively involved in customizing their ecosystem. SmartThings confirmed nothing has changed with regard to open API and third party developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, price, long-term contracts and false alarms have kept customers from taking the plunge. SmartThings and ADT are hoping this new line of products will combat these reservations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this finally the perfect marriage of security monitoring and home automation? How will it stack up against the Nest Secure system? We'll see, as the Samsung SmartThings ADT Home Security line of products roll out this October.\n",

I liked that fridge a lot more than I thought I would, but with retail prices starting at more than $5,000, it was much too expensive for most folks to justify a purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter Family Hub 2.0, which sees Samsung expanding the fleet in year two to include new models that are less fancy -- and less expensive -- than before. The cheapest of the bunch is the RF265BEAESR, a basic French door model in plain stainless steel. Originally priced at $3,299, the model has enjoyed regular discounts since its debut. As of writing this, Samsung has it listed on sale for $2,299, which is downright reasonable for a dumb French door fridge, let alone a smart one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trade-off is that you no longer get a luxurious, four-door build or a \"Flex Zone\" capable of switching between fridge and freezer settings depending on what you want to put in it, but those are acceptable sacrifices for people who just want those touchscreen smarts at the lowest price possible. The good news: those smarts are just as smart as before -- which is to say that they aren't perfect, but they're a little better than you might expect. And, with Samsung's Bixby voice assistant set to arrive in Family Hub fridges via software update at some point in the future, those smarts stand to improve with time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cheaper Family Hub isn't the stunner that its predecessor was, and it isn't a must-have by any stretch, but it's still a decent refrigerator with compelling features you won't find anywhere else. If it fills you with skepticism, then feel free to skip it, but if that touchscreen inspires fridge envy, it's never been more affordable. I say anything under $2,500 is a pretty fair price for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of the new, cheaper Family Hub, the answer is everything that last year's more expensive Family Hub can do. Some of the highlights include:\n",
      "\n",
      "The better question might be what can't the Family Hub do yet. The big omission is Bixby voice controls, which Samsung has long been promising. They'll arrive sooner or later, and when they do, there's a chance that they make the Family Hub a lot easier to use, but for now, they get an \"incomplete\" grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "One problem is that we're starting to see voice-activated touchscreen gadgets like the Amazon Echo Show make their way into people's homes, which raises the bar for a dedicated display like the Family Hub's. Eventually, I suspect that it'll basically serve as a king-sized, Bixby-powered Echo Show for your kitchen, but we aren't there yet, and I wouldn't fault anybody who wanted to wait until we were before buying in.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there are still some nice year-two refinements to the user interface. You'll find a few more apps, for instance, including a Nomiku app that can control smart sous vide gadgets. Samsung's existing apps are better-designed, too, with things like cartoonish avatars for each family member. They're also better-integrated with each other. For instance, after picking out something to cook from the Allrecipes app, you can select specific ingredients to add to your shopping list, or set timers specific to a particular part of the recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the original Family Hub, you can open the camera feed and drag expiration timers over top of specific things in the fridge, but they won't live over top of that feed like before. Instead, they're relegated to a separate list. I'm not a fan of that change, as it puts those expiration reminders out of sight and out of mind, where they're less helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also still no app for the Samsung-owned SmartThings connected home platform. The ability to toggle lights on and off or lock your door by tapping on the fridge might offer questionable utility at best, but it's still strange that Samsung hasn't done a better job of integrating its ecosystem by now.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Unlike last year's glamorous four-door models, the cheapest Family Hub fridge comes in a simple French door build with about 24 cubic feet of total storage space. It's still a few steps above entry level as far as French doors are concerned -- you get an in-door ice and water dispenser, as well as a temperature-adjustable \"Cool Select Pantry\" drawer and shelves that slide in and fold up to make room for tall items below. You can also get it in black stainless steel for an additional $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of that is unique to this fridge (far from it), but it does make for a model that, on its own, would typically retail for somewhere between $1,600 and $2,000. That's before you factor in the touchscreen, the camera and the fridge apps. In other words, Samsung hit a strange sweet spot here -- cheap enough to bring the Family Hub's price way down, but still nice enough to call it a legitimate upgrade for most folks. In this case, the boring design is a feature, not a bug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, it's fair to be disappointed if you were holding out for a design that's more refined. There's still the \"Ice Master\" ice maker eating up space on the top shelf -- and yes, there's still a much-too-narrow shelf in the door that we've affectionately dubbed the \"salsa moat.\" In fairness to Samsung, both seem slightly less egregious than they were -- the Ice Master is a tad skinnier, while the salsa moat offers slightly more depth than before. They're both still design imperfections, but more annoyances than deal-breakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.2 of the refrigerator's 24.2 cubic feet of total storage space are allocated to the fridge, which puts it on the small side of the French door spectrum. It's not a compact model by any stretch, but it might not be the best choice for a family of more than four or five.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Family Hub isn't as fancy as before, but it still offers decent performance for a fridge at this price range. During a week or so of non-stop performance tests in our appliances lab, it held accurate temperatures throughout the body of the fridge at both the default 37-degree setting and the coldest setting of 34 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't perfect, though. The bottom of the left door and the top of the right door both ran just slightly on the warm side, averaging temperatures above 40 degrees F at the default setting. That's pretty typical for a mid-range fridge like this, and not a real concern at all given that door shelves typically hold things like butter, beverages and preservative-heavy condiments. The temperatures in the body of the fridge are what really count.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cool Select Pantry drawer was more of a disappointment. It claims to offer three distinct temperature settings: 34, 38 and 41 degrees. The actual temperature range is much tighter, ranging from 34 to 37 degrees, and it also seemed susceptible to temperature changes in the body of the fridge surrounding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's par for the course with temperature-adjustable drawers that live inside of the fridge itself, where it's quite a challenge to maintain a separate temperature. It's still useful if you want to soften up some cheese or get some soda a degree or two colder, but if precision is what you're after, you'll be better off looking for a model with a drawer that lives outside of the fridge itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RF265BEAESR is designed to bring the Family Hub's touchscreen and grocery cameras into your kitchen at a much lower expense than before, and if you can catch it on sale, that's exactly what it offers. At $2,500 or less, you'll be spending a little less than you would on GE's coffee-making smart fridge and a lot less than you'll need to spend on the LG Smart InstaView fridge. You won't get last year's premium design, but you will get all of the same apps and smart features as before. Plus, the fridge is still a pretty decent performer, and nice enough to feel like you aren't compromising too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung hasn't made the Family Hub a must-have yet, though. That might change as new software updates arrive, but for now, the touchscreen smarts amount to little more than a fun, semi-frivolous extra. If you're tempted, here's my advice: track one down at a department store and play around with the screen a bit. If it's still the sort of frivolous extra that strikes your fancy, then feel free to give it a shot. Worst case scenario: you'll pay a reasonable amount for a perfectly decent fridge with a touchscreen you won't use all that much.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blossom Smart Watering Controller is one of the best products I've ever tested that I don't recommend to anyone. If it was unique, I'd love it, as it competently provides a truly useful service. Blossom replaces your existing sprinkler controller and lets you control your sprinklers with your phone via the Blossom app. Better yet, Blossom monitors the weather and helps you schedule your sprinklers to avoid running them when it rains.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have an in-ground sprinkler system, I recommend investing in a smart sprinkler controller as it'll not only make your life easier, but it could also save you money over time by helping you conserve water. Even though it works well enough, I can't recommend the $150 Blossom Smart Watering Controller as you have better options. Both the $200 Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller and the $100 Orbit B-Hyve offer more advanced smarts and scheduling options than Blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blossom is hard to recommend mainly because it gets caught in the middle ground between the most budget-friendly smart sprinkler (B-Hyve) and the smartest (Rachio). Like the competition, Blossom connects to your home Wi-Fi network and works with the EPA WaterSense rebate program. If you're interested in a smart sprinkler, head here to see if you qualify for a rebate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the competition, Blossom doesn't have anything that helps it stands out from an increasingly competitive smart sprinkler field. B-Hyve is appealing because of its price, and it has a great app that balances depth of options with ease of use. Rachio has a similarly great app and has the most scheduling flexibility of the field. It also works with the most other smart-home platforms so you can tie your sprinklers into your larger smart-home setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blossom lets you schedule your sprinklers in relation to sunset or sunrise. Otherwise, it does what you'd expect and nothing more. That wasn't always the case. Blossom was one of the first smart sprinklers to hit the market, and it was initially priced and designed to compete directly with Rachio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original Blossom was $180 for 12 zones of control to undercut Rachio's $200 for eight or $250 for 16 zone system. Blossom was waterproof and Rachio wasn't. Blossom also supplemented Wi-Fi with power line networking. Essentially, if your sprinkler controller was located in a spot with a bad signal, Blossom could communicate with your router using the wiring in your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The startup behind the sprinkler controller -- also called Blossom -- later announced a cheaper model called the Blossom 8, which it offered in addition to the original as a $130 alternative if you didn't need power line communication or waterproofing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the original Blossom is no longer available. The Blossom 8 was redubbed the Blossom 7 (to reflect that you need to use a different type of connection for the eighth zone), then just Blossom again. The price has gone up to $150. It doesn't have power line networking and it's not waterproof. Ironically, Rachio now offers a waterproof case. Plus, Blossom isn't just competing with Rachio anymore, and the cheaper $100 B-Hyve includes a waterproof case as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blossom still does plenty of things well. $150 isn't an unreasonable price, and if you can find it on sale, it's worth your consideration. You can buy Blossom on the company's site, or head to Amazon to look for a deal. Right now, it's only available in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installing Blossom is pretty easy -- you need to attach a wire for each of your zones and plug it in. If you can install a thermostat, you can install Blossom. You'll use the app to create an account and connect the controller to your Wi-Fi network, then the app walks you through the rest and sets up your zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "You determine the schedule -- you can water on fixed days of the week, after an interval of days, or on odd or even days. You also tell Blossom what time you'd like watering to start on the days you choose. In addition to setting a specific time, you have the option to set your start time in relation to sunrise or sunset (so you can start your sprinklers an hour before sunrise, and Blossom will adapt the time each day based on when the sun will rise in your area).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, you can decide how long you'd like your sprinklers to run each time, or you can turn on the sprinkler's smarts. If you pick the latter, you'll want to tell Blossom about each zone you're watering -- it asks you for the type of plant in the zone, the type of sprinkler you use, and whether the zone gets rainfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "With smart scheduling, Blossom will determine how long to run the sprinklers based on your schedule and yard info, and it'll adapt your schedule based on local weather forecasts. You can turn push notifications on in the settings, too, so you'll know if Blossom is cancelling a watering session.\n",
      "\n",
      "After you get your schedule set, you can also run the sprinkler manually if you want to add extra watering. The app makes it easy to hit a button and run a zone. You can also start your sprinklers with a voice command through Amazon's digital assistant Alexa or the Google Assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Link your Blossom account to either your Alexa or Google account, then you can give a command to the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, respectively, to start or stop the sprinklers. You can't check the watering schedule or do anything advanced with your voice, but the basic voice controls worked well with both Amazon and Google.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between its weather monitoring, its easy-to-use app and its compatibility with Alexa and the Google Assistant, Blossom gets enough of the basics right to be a good smart sprinkler. It's just lacking some of the extras and depth that make Rachio and B-Hyve great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike Rachio and B-Hyve, Blossom doesn't offer a fully smart schedule. You always need to tell Blossom what days you want to water, and it'll just use its weather info to skip days accordingly. Rachio and B-Hyve go one step beyond that, and offer a schedule option where they'll water only when your yard needs it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blossom also lacks middle ground. You can't set your own ideal watering duration and turn on weather monitoring smarts. B-Hyve doesn't have a middle ground between smart and dumb scheduling either, but Rachio has several options that mix your input with its smarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Blossom, you have to turn on WaterSense as a mode in the settings. Rachio and B-Hyve just automatically comply with WaterSense regulations. Flip it on, and WaterSense mode will also ask you for soil type, slope and amount of shade for each zone and determine appropriate run times for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know why WaterSense isn't turned on by default. Rachio and B-Hyve just fill in standard options for the extra questions if you don't provide the info. Rachio and B-Hyve also have a host of advanced settings that you can fine tune if you're an expert, and they allow you to attach rain and moisture sensors to your system so they can both know exactly when to water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Rachio and B-Hyve have onboard controls, but Blossom doesn't. And Rachio and B-Hyve also have detailed calendars in their app that show watering and weather schedules. Blossom has a basic calendar showing your schedule, and a simple history showing when it has skipped watering, but no watering history, no detailed calendar with weather and watering info, and no water usage tracking.\n",
      "\n",
      "B-Hyve's Alexa skill offers a lot of extra commands, and Rachio lets you pick your weather station for forecasts, and also works with a bunch of other smart home products such as Nest, IFTTT, Wink and SmartThings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blossom Smart Watering Controller isn't a bad product or a broken product. It works, and if you still have an ordinary timer for your in-ground sprinklers, the $150 seven-zone Blossom would be a significant upgrade. I don't recommend it simply because it doesn't have an edge on the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "If price isn't an issue, go with the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller -- it's the smartest of the bunch and worth springing for, especially if you have other smart-home gear. If you do want a controller and want the most smarts for your money, go with the Orbit B-Hyve. Without a unique feature to call its own, Blossom wouldn't be my top choice for anyone, but it'll get the job done if you find it on sale.\n",
      "Delta Leak Detector\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart leak detectors have been around for years now, and we've tested a bunch of them. At $80, Delta's new Wi-Fi leak detector offers the solid functionality we've come to expect along with some additional user-friendly features. Is this leak detector a game-changing must-have? With its waterproofing issues and lack of smart home integrations, I have to say no.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delta does start strong though, with a sleek, white disc design. This low-profile device isn't an eyesore and should fit in most utility closets and under-sink spaces without being intrusive. Two concentric rings of conductive metal monitor for the presence of unwanted moisture. A single button on the top of the device surrounded by an LED light ring acts as the main physical interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond leak detection, Delta incorporates the ability to monitor temperature. Set the threshold for low and high temps in the app and you'll receive notifications if your space exceeds the limits. This could be especially helpful for cold winter nights when pipes could be at risk for freezing. The app also includes a log of timestamped temperature, leak and alert history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest selling point of Delta's leak detector is the hub-free Wi-Fi connectivity. This detector connects to Wi-Fi through your mobile phone via the app, eliminating the need for a smart home hub. Removing the smart-hub middleman is a welcome feature, but it's not new. The Roost Smart Water Leak Detector, D-Link Wi-Fi Water Sensor and Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector all pull it off, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setup is simple enough. Inside the box, you'll find the detector, a quick start guide and three AAA batteries, which Delta says will last about two years. Certain activities do require higher battery usage. Multiple leak alerts, a detector being offline for an extended period of time or a firmware update will drain the battery. Delta sends an alert to change the batteries once they reach 20 percent. You can also view the battery life percentage and signal strength at any time in the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get started, you'll download the Delta Leak Detector app from the App Store or from the Google Play Store and create a profile. On-screen instructions will help you configure your device. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi must be functioning on your mobile device to complete setup. The leak detector is not compatible with 5GHz Wi-Fi and won't show those networks in the available Wi-Fi options.\n",
      "\n",
      "The detector's ability to independently connect to your home's Wi-Fi without going through a smart hub is a plus. It simplifies setup and presumably means fewer connectivity issues. However, if the power goes out, in most cases your Wi-Fi will too, and the device won't be able to send you notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can name the detector for the appliance you'd like to monitor. There's plenty of opportunity for customization here. Choose from a list of common leaky appliances (think \"sump pump,\" \"sink,\" \"toilet\" or \"water heater\") or create your own device name using the \"Other\" category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delta includes the option to add multiple users for SMS and email alerts. I like this feature for extra insurance, in case I'm out of town or otherwise not able to respond to a leak notification.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to mobile alerts, the device also beeps and flashes its center LED when it detects a problem. Placed in a high-traffic area like under a kitchen sink or behind a toilet, this is a welcome back-up notification system. The beeps and flashes last about 10 seconds and occur every 30 seconds for three repetitions. However, if the detector were in a utility room or closet I doubt anyone would notice, as the beeping isn't very loud and doesn't last very long.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tested water both above and around the device with success. With the detector sitting directly beneath one of my fake leaks, it took around 10 droplets for the water to roll down the device's edge and contact the metal rings. This is where I think Delta gets it right, by adding the ability to detect leaks before real pooling or flooding begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some caveats to using this device for water sensing, though. First, Delta states in the user guide that the device is not designed for complete submersion. Delta does say the battery cover is designed to be tight enough to keep water out, but it also recommends replacing the device entirely if water reaches the battery compartment. For me, that's hard to swallow considering the $80 price tag. Last year's Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector debuted with the same annoying issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, this leak detector lacks meaningful smart-home integrations. Though it was developed with iDevices, don't be fooled. Delta's leak detector doesn't integrate with major voice-assistant platforms like Apple's Homekit, Google Home or Amazon's Alexa. Delta uses iDevices technology for Wi-Fi pairing, but you're completely dependent on the standalone Delta Leak Detector app for controls and notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delta's leak detector is set to enter the market this fall at $80, making it one of the more expensive smart leak detectors available. While it does offer easy setup, a companion app with good customization options and a sleek design, the price tag seems high.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leak detector seems squarely aimed at competing with the similarly priced Honeywell Lyric Wi-Fi Leak and Freeze Detector. But for the same money, Honeywell offers a cable to extend detection range, IFTTT compatibility and humidity measuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "That leaves Delta's Leak Detector as a visually attractive but pricey alternative. It comes with quite a few useful features, but it isn't without its waterproofing flaws. It is currently available for preorder, with a release date set for October 12.\n",
      "Lifx Mini Wi-Fi Smart Bulb\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hot on the heels of its announcement Thursday that Lifx current-gen bulbs now support Apple HomeKit, Lifx is preparing to take orders on its next generation of color-changing smart LEDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's called Lifx Mini, and it comes in three varieties: a fully color-changing bulb for $45, a color-tunable, white light bulb for $30, and a fixed white light bulb at 2,700K for $25.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the name suggests, each Mini bulb sports a slightly more compact design than before, but still puts out a healthy 800 lumens of light at peak brightness, which is roughly comparable to a 60W incandescent despite only drawing 9W each. The previous generation of Lifx bulbs put out a much more ample 1,100 lumens -- Lifx plans to continue making and selling them at a price of $60 each for customers willing to spend a little more for some extra brightness (that's about £45 or AU$75).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lifx Plus bulbs, which add in infrared night vision diodes to help light things up for your security cameras at night, aren't going anywhere, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like those existing Lifx bulbs, the Mini LEDs each house their own Wi-Fi radio, allowing them to connect directly with your home network. That means that you can control them from anywhere that has an internet connection, and it also means that you don't need a special hub to translate their signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "That last bit is the biggest differentiator between Lifx and its top competitor, Philips Hue, and it doesn't appear to be changing anytime soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Mini bulbs also enjoy all of the existing Lifx integrations with third-party services, including the newly released support for Apple HomeKit. That means you can control them alongside other HomeKit-compatible devices using the Home app on iOS devices. It also means that you can dim them up and down or change their color using a Siri command. Beyond HomeKit, Lifx bulbs also work with Amazon's Alexa, the Google Home smart speaker, IFTTT, Logitech Harmony and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Mini bulbs, Lifx is promising a wider distribution of light than with previous generations. Those older bulbs sport a flat-topped design that puts out plenty of light above the bulb, but not quite as much down below it. The Mini bulbs should do a little bit better in that regard, but with less brightness overall, the difference might be negligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also a bit skeptical of the beam angle improvement, seeing as how the Mini LED's bulb doesn't extend out any further than its base. I'm nitpicking, but that's the same general problem with the previous generation's design.\n",
      "\n",
      "My other qualm here is the price. $45 is still an awful lot to spend on a smart bulb, even one that changes colors. Still, that's pretty much par for the course with color-changers like these. The also-HomeKit-compliant Sylvania Smart LED costs $45 a piece, too, while Philips Hue LEDs each cost $50. Even the typically budget-minded TP-Link sells its own color-changing smart bulb for $50.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard to fault Lifx for being expensive when everyone's expensive, and in fairness, the $45 Lifx Mini is the brand's most affordable color-changer yet. Still, there's a huge opening for a more value-minded alternative to emerge. It's a shame Lifx wouldn't or couldn't go there with its fourth generation of bulbs -- and a shame that it wasn't able to drop the price without dropping the brightness, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price of the $25 fixed, white-light Mini is even more telling. Names like Cree, GE and Philips Hue have long been selling white-light-only bulbs for $15 each, or less. With competitors like those, it's the toughest of the three Minis to recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lifx will begin accepting preorders on all three of the new Mini bulbs starting Friday. As soon as we get our hands on a few, expect full reviews out of the CNET Smart Home.\n",

      "\n",
      "If your home has high ceilings, first off, congratulations on your palace. Second, you might need some extra oomph in your light bulbs since they're up so high. Thing is, if you're looking for BR30-shaped LED floodlights, most options in the lighting aisle won't come much brighter than 700 lumens -- bright enough for normal use, but probably dimmer than what you're looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's where Cree's newest LED light bulb comes in. At an asking price of $11 per bulb, it's a 100W replacement floodlight that puts out 1,500 lumens, which is just about as bright as BR30-shaped bulbs get.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most LEDs, it's efficient, too, with an actual power draw of just 16.5W. Use it to replace a 100W incandescent floodlight that you use for an average of three hours a day, and you'll knock about $10 off of your yearly power bill. In other words, it'll pay for itself in just over a year of use.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, it'll keep saving you money for decades thanks to the 22.8-year lifespan. Cree backs that up with an industry-leading 10-year warranty.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the looks of it, Cree got just about everything right with this bulb. Not only is it bright and efficient, but it also dims exceedingly well, showing absolutely no visible flicker with any of the switches I used in testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cree tells me that it worked in conjunction with Lutron and Leviton, two of the leading manufacturers of dimmer switches, to make sure that the bulb aced the in-house certification tests of both brands before bringing it to market. Sure enough, the dimming performance was virtually identical on modern dimmer switches from each brand, dialing down to a satisfying minimum of 7 percent on each. The only real disappointment was that the bulb only dimmed down to 18 percent on an old rotary-style dimmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also aced my thermal management tests in which I measure how far the brightness dips as the bulb heats up during prolonged use. Most LED bulbs will see their initial brightness fall by anywhere from 10 to 20 percent in the first 45 minutes of use before the heat sinks really kick in and level things out. Cree claims that it beefed up the thermal management capabilities for this bulb, and the company wasn't kidding -- the initial brightness only dropped by about 3 percent in my test. That's an outstanding result, and reassuring if you need to use this bulb in an enclosed fixture where the heat gets trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulb's final selling point is that it boasts a color rendering score in the low 90s, which is very good; most LEDs score in the mid-80s at best. Bulbs with higher scores on the color rendering index (CRI) will do a better job of making the colors in your home pop -- whiter whites, more vivid reds and so on. Cree made color rendering a focal point for its entire lineup in 2016, and its bulbs do produce noticeably better colors and cleaner whites than the average LED.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very good bulb with no real weaknesses, and the price is right at $11. Consider that most dimmable 65W replacement floodlight LEDs sell for about $7. Paying a couple of extra bucks for almost twice as much brightness seems fair to me, especially for a bulb that performs as well as this one does.\n",
      "Fabriq Chorus Smart Speaker with Amazon Alexa\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A little over half a year after it released a fabric-covered, Alexa-enabled alternative to Amazon's Echo Dot mini-speaker, Fabriq is back -- this time with a new Alexa speaker called the Chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      "At $99, the Chorus is basically an off-brand Amazon Tap, and it offers a couple of key upgrades over the original Fabriq speaker (now known as the Riff). Like the Tap, the Chorus houses an internal battery that lets you pick it up from the charging cradle and take it with you for up to six hours of portable playback. With a larger, more powerful speaker than before, the Chorus is also better at filling a room with sound. Where the Riff requires you to push a button to activate Alexa, you can activate the Chorus with just your voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chorus compares well against the Tap, too. Not only is it $30 less expensive, it also comes in an attractive variety of colors and designs -- four options here at launch, with more promised in the coming months. On top of that, Fabriq's app lets you link multiple Chorus and Riff speakers together over the air for wireless, synchronized playback -- a neat trick that the Tap doesn't offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tap's trump card, however, might be Amazon's ESP feature, which makes it so that only the Alexa device closest to you will respond to your command. We haven't seen any third-party Alexa gadgets with ESP, the Chorus included. That's a shame, since ESP is all but mandatory if you're planning to fill your home with multiple Alexa devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from that, the Chorus offers the same Alexa experience as you'd get with the Tap. You wake it up by saying \"Alexa,\" then follow that up with a question or command. With Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios inside, you can ask to stream music and podcasts from services like Spotify, TuneIn, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and Amazon Music, or just stream audio straight from your phone or tablet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexa also offers traffic updates, kitchen timers, \"flash briefings\" of the day's news headlines, control of a wide variety of smart home gadgets, and access to a growing library of over 20,000 free \"skills\" that each teach Alexa new tricks when you enable them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for audio quality, the Chorus sounded pretty good to my ear during a non-scientific test run in the CNET Smart Home. It isn't as full-sounding as the Amazon Echo or Echo Show, but it's definitely a clear step up from the Riff, and more or less on par with the Amazon Tap.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also use any Alexa device to start playback on any other, including the Chorus. For instance, I placed a Chorus on the side table next to the front door and named it \"Front Door.\" Then, I asked the Echo in the kitchen to \"play jazz music at the front door.\" It worked perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, you can't use the Chorus to make a voice call to other Alexa devices, but then again, neither can the Tap. That calling and messaging feature is reserved for the Echo, the Echo Dot, the Echo Show and the Alexa app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chorus is available starting today on Fabriq's website, on Target.com, and on Amazon. We'll keep testing it out, along with all of the other new third-party Alexa gadgets we're seeing this year. Plan on seeing our picks for the best of the bunch in time for the holiday buying season.\n",

      "C by GE Lamp with Alexa\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sol\" is the sun-inspired name of GE's long-awaited Alexa lamp. It's basically just a smallish Amazon Echo smart speaker with a big honkin' halo growing out of its head instead of the usual indicator lights. It's available on Amazon, and costs $200.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, ask yourself: If the $180 Amazon Echo sat beneath a Dysonesque ring of light, would you pay an extra $20 for it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a hard time faulting anybody who says yes. After all, using Alexa to turn lights on and off is one of the virtual voice assistant's most popular features, and the Sol puts the experience into a singular package. Plus, that highly visible ring of light lets GE offer visual indicators for things like Alexa's kitchen timers and the time of day. The Sol gives Alexa one or two new tricks that you won't get with the Echo.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can't make calls to other Alexa users, though -- for that, you'll need the Echo, the smaller Echo Dot or the touchscreen-equipped Echo Show. More importantly, it lacks Amazon's ESP feature, which makes sure only the Alexa device closest to you responds to your commands. That's a shame -- ESP is all but mandatory if you plan on placing lots of Alexa devices throughout your home. Amazon declined to respond when asked whether or not third-party Alexa devices like the Sol should expect to be able to add ESP in the future via software update.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, if you're just looking to bring Alexa into something like a bedroom or office, and you're willing to splurge a bit for something you'll like looking at, then the Sol fits the bill. I like it a lot more than I thought I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sol is a neat-looking lamp, and roughly the diameter of a basketball at 13 inches wide. It features two rings of light: an exterior ring for the LED lamp, and an interior ring for the familiar, blue glow that indicates Alexa is listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "That interior ring works just like the ring of light on the top of the Amazon Echo -- it lights up whenever you say \"Alexa\" and glows red whenever you have her on mute. It also lets Alexa offer visual indicators. As of now, the two that GE offers are a pair of lights that you can turn on to indicate the time (red for the hour, blue for the minute), along with a shrinking ring of light that shows you how much time is left on any timers you've asked Alexa to set.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get started, you plug the Sol in and sync with it using the C by GE app on your Android or iOS device. From there, you pair the lamp with your Wi-Fi network and enter your Amazon login credentials to enable Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sol works just like you'd expect from an Alexa device, and aside from calling other Alexa users, it can do anything the Amazon Echo can do. That includes music streaming and news briefings, making shopping lists and telling bad jokes. You also get access to Alexa's ever-growing library of \"skills,\" a free collection of extra tricks you can enable that now number well over 20,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first one of those skills you should enable is the \"CbyGE\" skill, because you'll need it in order to control the Sol's light output using voice commands. Once it's enabled, you can ask Alexa to turn your Sol on and off, dim it up and down or change its color temperature from an orangey, soft white to a stark white daylight tone. There are also touch buttons on the top of the lamp's base to adjust the brightness and volume, and to turn it on and off.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also do all of that using the app, along with a couple of other tricks. Beyond turning those clock and timer indicators on and off, you can also group the Sol with other C by GE lighting products to control multiple lights at once or schedule lighting changes for specific times of day. That includes color temperature-shifting \"scene\" changes, as well as timed fades to help ease you out of bed in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I do -- or I at least love the idea of lamp. As I said up at the top, lighting control is one of Alexa's coolest capabilities, so packing her directly into a lighting fixture makes for a surprisingly compelling combo.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, the Sol's sound quality was better than I expected: not quite as good as the Amazon Echo, but close, and right about on par with the midrange Amazon Tap. It won't please audiophiles, but it's perfect for casual listeners, or anyone who just wants to listen to a chapter in their audiobook before bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading under it might be a different story, though, because the Sol isn't as bright as most lamps. GE doesn't offer an official lumen count for the lamp, but to my eye, it's nowhere near as bright as a 60W incandescent bulb. Think of it more as an accent light than a primary light source.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest complaint, however, is that it doesn't feel like the premium device that its price suggests. The plastic build and the sparse, hard-to-read design of the touch buttons err on the cheap side of minimalism. The rings of light aren't diffused quite enough to keep you from seeing the individual diodes inside, which emphasizes the artificial quality of the light. It's pretty, but it isn't perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think GE missed an opportunity to pack color-changing diodes into the lamp, and make the Sol something of a standalone Philips Hue competitor. Alexa is fully capable of controlling color-changing lights like those, and GE already took advantage of that fact by letting her change the lamp's color temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why stop there, though? Adding in a full array of colors would have been a nice complement to the lamp's already unique design, as well as a smart way to help GE justify its expense. The Sol could have also been a good opportunity for GE to finally insert itself into the color-changing category, where it has long lagged. Instead, the opportunity is missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nah, probably not. Consider that a nearly identical lamp without the Alexa smarts is currently marked down to $40 on Amazon. Even if you take that lamp at its inflated suggested retail price of $100, that's still only half a Sol. Are the speaker and Alexa smarts really worth another $100 when you can get an Echo Dot for less than $50?\n",
      "\n",
      "Make no mistake, the Sol isn't priced at a value -- it's priced like the first-of-its-kind product that it is. There is no other big-name Alexa lamp to speak of at the moment, which gives GE leverage to charge a premium. That would have been more forgivable had GE given it fully color-changing light or a less plasticky build -- instead, people who want it will have to pay a little more than they probably should. Capitalism!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Sol is an unexpectedly good idea that's executed fairly well, which is more than I can say about a lot of products that ask for a place in the smart home. If you want a Sol, feel free to splurge on it, but I'd recommend waiting to see if its price comes down at all -- or if other Alexa-friendly lighting manufacturers like Philips, Lifx or Sylvania ultimately try to eclipse it with a lamp of their own.\n",
      "Wiz Color Wi-Fi Smart LED Starter Kit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Editor's Note, 5:15 PM EST, 9/15/17: This review originally claimed in error that the Wiz LEDs did not have a white-light setting brighter than 450 lumens. In actuality, there's a 4,200 K setting that reaches 807 lumens, roughly on par with a 60W replacement incandescent. The review text has been updated accordingly, and the score has changed from a 6.2 to a 6.9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a walk through your local lighting aisle and you'll find plenty of good LED options for $5 or less. Color-changing smart bulbs, on the other hand, are still pretty expensive -- big-name options like Lifx and Philips Hue typically charge about $50 per bulb.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that sense, the Wiz LEDs are a slight step in the right direction. For $70, you get two color-changing smart bulbs, plus a handy physical remote for quick adjustments. Like their more expensive competitors, the Wiz LEDs work with Alexa and with the Google Home smart speaker for voice commands, and they have their own channel on the free online automation service IFTTT, too. With Wi-Fi inside, they don't need a hub to talk to your router -- just screw them in, turn them on, and sync up with them on your phone using the Wiz app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem here is that the bulbs aren't as bright as advertised, at least not at the white-light settings you'd expect. Wiz pegs the light output of each bulb at 800 lumens -- about as bright as a standard 60W incandescent bulb -- but in my own tests, the two ends of the white light spectrum (2,700 K and 6,500 K) wouldn't go any higher than 450 lumens. You have to go with a 4,200 K \"daylight\" setting in the middle of that spectrum in order to hit 800 lumens.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the colors, they're all fairly accurate, but none of them go any brighter than 200 lumens.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can look past that shortcoming, you'll find a fairly decent control app that lets you change the color of the bulbs or style them using a number of preset themes, including color cycles with custom speed settings. You can also make a quick color scheme by taking a picture, group the bubs by room or schedule the bulbs to turn off and on at specific times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike Lifx or Hue, the Wiz LEDs also come with a physical remote. On it, you'll find off and on buttons along with dimming controls and four customizable presets. In the app, you can pick what each of those preset buttons does for each individual bulb you point it at. Preset No. 4 could be the party lighting setting for one bulb and the nightlight setting for the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remote is a nice differentiator, but it was a pain to use, and it was unreliable from anything more than a few feet away from the bulb. Even up close, there were times where I'd need to press a button multiple times from a variety of different angles before the signal would register with the bulb. Controlling multiple bulbs at once is technically possible, but I was only able to get it to work once or twice during my tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dimming the bulbs up and down was slow and stuttery, with visible \"bumps\" from one brightness setting to the next. Compared with other smart lighting remotes I've tested from names like TCP and Haiku, this one was far too finicky to recommend -- though Wiz tells me that they're working on a firmware fix that should be ready within weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syncing with Alexa and the Google Assistant for voice controls was a lot easier. With Alexa, the Wiz app actually offers two skills: one for basic on/off and dimming controls, and an \"advanced\" version that also lets you trigger color cycles. The rub is that the advanced skill requires you to tack \"my Wiz\" onto your command, as in, \"Alexa, tell my Wiz to change the reading lamp to the Party light setting.\" At any rate, you'll enable either one with just a few taps in the Alexa app.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few problems here, though. First, neither skill actually lets you change the color of your bulbs (again, Wiz tells me that a fix is planned for the near future). This is odd enough with the basic skill, given that Alexa added native support for color-changing bulbs months ago, but even the advanced skill can't handle them. Say, \"Alexa, tell my Wiz to change the reading lamp to blue,\" and she'll tell you she doesn't know a light setting called \"blue.\" You have to use presets like \"Christmas,\" \"Ocean\" and \"Fireplace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even worse, those advanced preset controls didn't work very well. I had to be very precise with my wording for Alexa to understand what I was talking about, and even then, they sometimes fired off in unexpected ways. Changing one lamp to the Party setting would end up changing all of my lamps to the Party setting, for instance. In another case, I asked for the red and green \"Christmas\" setting, and somehow got the green and white \"Mojito\" setting instead. No idea how that happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Google Home front, things are a little simpler. After adding your bulbs in the Google Home app, you'll be able to tell the Google Assistant to turn the lights on and off or change their colors -- no \"tell my Wiz\" necessary. The downside is that you can't trigger any of those preset color cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're interested in color-changing smart bulbs but put off by the high cost of buying in, then you might consider saving a few bucks by going with Wiz. I'd advise against it, though. Whether by voice or by remote, the controls are too clunky, and the bulbs aren't as bright as the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation: Stick with my top smart lighting pick, the non-color-changing Philips Hue White LED starter kit (you can always add a color-changing bulb or two later on down the line). If you'd rather splurge on color-changing light from the get-go, then consider Lifx, which offers the best brightness and color quality, and the best app, too. Both options work well with Alexa, Google Home, IFTTT and a lot more. In my opinion, each is well worth the extra cash.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've literally waited years for a more affordable Nest -- and it's finally here in the form of the $169 Thermostat E. At 80 bucks less than Nest's premium Learning Thermostat, the E excels in its simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sports plastic components, fewer wire terminals and a lower-res screen. Because of the display's limitations, you also won't find Farsight on the E, a feature that displays custom info such as an analog clock or the current weather forecast from a distance. Otherwise, the E does all of the same things as the Learning Thermostat. It will auto-adjust your heat and AC based on whether or not you're home and give you the same remote access from the Nest app. You can even enlist Amazon's Alexa speakers or the Google Home to adjust the temperature for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But aside from its more minimal off-white design, the Thermostat E doesn't do anything new or innovative. You still won't find a remote temperature sensor or compatibility with Apple's Siri voice control platform, HomeKit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, the Thermostat E is a welcome, long-awaited addition to Nest's product roster. It's particularly worth your consideration if you like Nest, but don't want to spend $249 on a single thermostat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back when thermostats were largely considered utilitarian home necessities (2011), Nest introduced its original Learning Thermostat. Suddenly, folks were lining up to spend $249 on Nest's smart heating and cooling device. It wasn't the first app-enabled thermostat ever sold, but its unique rounded design and integrated tech struck a chord with consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long, Honeywell, Ecobee and other manufacturers introduced smart thermostats in the same price range. But while Nest was busy working on second- and third-gen versions of the same $249 thermostat, its competitors were rounding out their lineups with new and less expensive smart thermostats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $169 Thermostat E matters because Nest is finally offering a more affordable product. (UK and Australian prices have yet to be announced, but that converts to about £130 or AU$210.) At 80 bucks less than its flagship model, the E also has almost all of the same smart functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Nest's E also has a similar rounded design, but this iteration is more minimal. It has plastic, rather than metal hardware components and a lower-res screen that doesn't support Nest's Farsight feature. Nest was going for a watercolor effect with the Thermostat E, so its screen has a \"frosted,\" almost blurred look. It's not great for viewing from a distance if you have less-than-perfect vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The E has only six wire terminals as well, so it won't work with quite as many HVAC systems as Nest's 10-terminal Learning Thermostat. The idea is that the E is the simpler model, the one you'd chose for a basic home setup, whereas the Learning Thermostat is the grown-up option that one you'd buy for more complicated HVAC systems.\n",

      "\n",
      "Everything, from the auto-adjusting heating and cooling schedule to the app control worked in much the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The auto-adjusting schedule is Nest's way of saying it will rely on the thermostat's built-in sensors, as well as your and your family's phone locations to determine if anyone's home. If it senses that everyone is out, it will switch the temperature to an energy-saving mode. You can still set ranges, though, to make sure the temperatures never reach extremes in the warmest and coldest months.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also manually override these settings whenever you want by adjusting the thermostat, using the app or with voice commands. For voice commands, you'll need an Amazon Alexa speaker or the Google Home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The installation is familiar too. You don't need a C-wire to run the E and the app guides you through the entire setup process. The Nest website can tell you whether your HVAC system is compatible with the Thermostat E.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Contact a professional if you have questions about your HVAC system and the installation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we already had a Nest account for the CNET Smart Home, as well as perfectly-Nest-thermostat-sized holes drilled in our thermostat testing area, the installation took only 10 minutes. It'll take longer if you need to create a new Nest account, drill new holes or paint or patch areas the previous thermostat used to cover. The first step, though, is always to shut off power to your thermostat at the circuit breaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nest's Thermostat E is a late but welcome addition to the smart thermostat market. You get a lot for your $169, too, including auto-adjusting scheduling and remote access via the app, Alexa and the Google Assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "You also get a pared-down, arguably improved design. No, the lighter plastic hardware doesn't feel as substantial, but I personally prefer the look of the minimal, off-white E. It's more likely to blend in with your wall, but it also manages to avoid the boring, white plastic aesthetic you find with so many standard thermostats.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the E isn't perfect. To reduce its price to $169, Nest opted for a lower-res screen, scrapped Farsight and dropped the number of available wire terminals. If any of those things give you pause, but you want to spend less than 200 bucks, look to the Ecobee3 Lite or the Honeywell Lyric T5.\n",

      "That clock is the iAVS16, and with far-field microphones that can hear you from across the room and Amazon's Alexa Voice Services programmed inside, it can do just about everything that Amazon's Echo line of smart speakers can do. You can ask for the weather forecast, control your smart home gadgets, stream music, or access any one of Alexa's more-than-20,000 free voice skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost? $150 -- a fairly steep premium for what iHome is calling the first voice-activated Alexa clock of its kind from a major brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the Alexa smarts, the iAVS16 offers LED mood lighting, a 10-watt internal amplifier for music playback, Bluetooth streaming support, an integrated speakerphone with digital echo cancellation and a 2.1A USB port for charging your devices while you sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iAVS16 has no internal alarm, and instead, relies entirely on Amazon's Alexa-powered alarm functionality. That means you'll need to ask Alexa to set the alarm instead of button-mashing like in olden days -- though, thankfully, the snooze button still works as an alternative to grumbling at Alexa to shut the heck up each morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iAVS16 reflects the fact that a growing number of manufacturers see Alexa's popularity as a rising tide capable of lifting their boat. Though it's the first time iHome has programmed Alexa directly into a device, this isn't the iHome team's first Alexa-friendly gadget. In addition to the Echo Dot alarm clock, the brand also offers automatable smart plugs that work with Alexa -- and you'll find all of them for sale on Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This year, iHome has focused on growing its Alexa smart home offerings and integrating artificial intelligence technologies into products across all categories, including smart plugs,\" said Gary Schultz, director of product and business development at iHome.\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, you can use iHome's app to program two of the clock's buttons -- the square and the triangle -- to toggle your iHome Plugs on and off. They'll work with any other Alexa-compatible plug, too. If plugs aren't your fancy, you can program those buttons to launch music stations and playlists.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third programmable button, marked with a star, can be programmed to trigger wake and sleep home control. Press when you wake up to turn on your lights and music all at once, or press before bed to turn everything off.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've already seen third parties pack Alexa into a lamp, a TV, a refrigerator, a thermostat and a growing range of smart speaker alternatives to the Echo. It's actually surprising that it's taken this long to get her into a clock, given the Echo Dot's established bedside appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, $150 is obviously an awful lot of money for an alarm clock, and considerably more than than what you'd spend on iHome's Echo Dot clock dock and an Echo Dot to go with it. The Beddi smart alarm clock costs a lot less, too -- it doesn't feature Alexa or any other voice assistant packed inside, but it does offer a whole host of smart home integrations capable of toggling your lights or adjusting your thermostat with the touch of a button.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iAVS16 is expected to hit retail outlets and Amazon in October. We'll test it out and tell you what we think in the coming weeks.\n",

The manufacturer's LG Lawn Mower Robot will work with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, the virtual assistants that you can cue with your voice. That means you should be able to say, \"Alexa, cut my grass\" or \"OK, Google, mow the lawn\" to your Alexa- or Google Assistant-enabled smart speaker when the grass is too long, and the Lawn Mower Robot will automatically do its thing.\n",

LG didn't release information about when it will be available, in which countries you can buy it or how much the mower will cost. It's sure to be expensive -- robot lawnmowers tend to start at about $1,000 (about £775 or AU$1,260) and increase from there depending on how large your yard is.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now Lenovo adds another compatible device to the list with the Home Assistant Pack, which connects Lenovo Tab 4 tablets (8-inch or 10-inch) to an Echo-like speaker. When docked, by sliding the tablet into a groove on the side of the speaker, the tablet screen becomes a status window for Alexa. It's similar to, but not as in-depth as what you see on the Echo Show.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cylindrical 3-watt speaker includes two far-field microphones (versus seven in Amazon's original Echo) and listens for the familiar \"Alexa\" wake-up command. In a brief hands-on test, the speaker responded well to Alexa voice commands, including playing music, offering a weather report, answering questions and streaming a radio station. Audio quality via the built-in 3-watt speaker was better suited to news than music.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visuals are provided by a custom Lenovo app, which needs to be downloaded to the Tab 4 tablet (we haven't had a chance to test it yet, but Lenovo says the app-and-dock combo will only work for Tab 4 tablets).\n",
      "\n",
      "Asking for the weather put a basic weather report up on the screen, and it shows the title and artist when playing songs. But there were no read-along lyrics or TV and movie playback, as on the Echo Show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though it's lacking some of the features of the $229 Echo Show, the Lenovo Home Assistant has a much more reasonable price. It'll be $69 in the US when it's released in October, plus the cost of a Tab 4 tablet, around $150. Pricing and availability for other regions is still be announced, but the Assistant roughly converts to £50 or AU$85.\n",

      "As far as surveillance goes, Qihan's Q-Link app gives you access to a live video stream of whatever the Sanbot Nano sees, as well as the ability to control the bot remotely anywhere you have internet access. The robot's object detection sensors are supposed to help it watch over the house and sound an alarm if unexpected activity takes place.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pitched as an alternative to retirement homes and emergency pendants, TruSense uses smart home gear to help senior citizens live independently for longer. Complete with motion sensing, temperature monitoring, leak detection and even voice controls, TruSense is a DIY kit of connected products sold alongside a monitoring service and an app that helps you track the habits of your aging parents so you'll know if something unusual occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A startup based in Cincinnati, TruSense doesn't actually use any of its own hardware. The motion sensors and hub come from SmartThings; TruSense uses an Amazon Echo Dot for voice control. The $200 starter kit contains the following pieces:\n",
      "\n",
      "You can purchase more devices if you need to, and the TruSense platform also offers a leak detector, a flush sensor and GPS trackers -- either a pendant, a vehicle tracker, or a GPS SmartSole which embeds a tracker in a shoe sole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between these pieces, the TruSense app will track what room your parents are in, and chart their activity over time so you can see patterns and be notified if something changes. The door/window sensors can be put on the fridge or cabinet to help you keep track of their eating habits. A motion sensor in the bedroom will try to interpret when they go to sleep and let you know if they're not getting up in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make use of TruSense's app, you'll need to pay a $50-per-month subscription fee, but that price includes a monitoring service. You can customize what notifications you'll receive, and also what notifications will alert the monitoring service. Your parents can also use the Amazon Echo Dot -- a smart speaker you can control with your voice -- to call the monitoring service for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $200 price for the starting kit isn't bad. A similar SmartThings monitoring kit costs $250. The $50 a month cost is more than comparable monitoring plans from Lowe's Iris and SimpliSafe, but roughly on par with professional services like ADT and AT&T Digital Life. To be worth it in the long run, then, the app will need to offer accurate data and useful insights. You don't have to pay a monthly fee to use SmartThings gear or an Amazon Echo Dot on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting Tuesday, you can buy a TruSense package on the company's site. For now, TruSense is only available in the US. I like the idea of bringing together disparate smart home pieces for the express purpose of helping you care for your aging parents. Check out the video above for a look at another startup with similar aims.\n",
      "\n",
      "For TruSense, using a motion tracker to monitor sleep habits or a door/window sensor to track eating might not always produce accurate results. You could open a cabinet and not get any food, but the system will still think you've eaten. Nevertheless, if the app and monitoring service work well, TruSense could help spot something out of the ordinary and provide some peace of mind in the meantime.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Philips \"SceneSwitch\" line of LED light bulbs promises versatility with the flip of a switch. Each one has three different light settings -- to change between them, you just turn the bulb off and back on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newest SceneSwitch bulb is a BR30-shaped floodlight that'll sell for $8 at Home Depot this fall. Flip it off and back on within a few seconds to cycle through a yellowy soft white setting, a whitish daylight setting and a dimmed-down night-light setting. Like the other SceneSwitch LEDs, it's a simple and interesting way to add some limited dimmability to a fixture without needing to replace the light switch or install expensive smart bulbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also a pretty good light bulb in its own right, and one of the most efficient floodlight LEDs we've ever tested. At just 8W, each one will add less than a buck to your yearly energy bill if you run it at the brightest setting for three hours a day. By comparison, a standard 65W incandescent floodlight at three hours of usage per day will add almost $8 to your yearly energy bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replace a bulb like that with the SceneSwitch floodlight, and it'll pay for itself in a little over a year. After that, it will continue saving you money for the rest of its 22-year life span -- decades longer than that incandescent would have lasted. Oh, and that longevity claim comes backed by a five-year warranty, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also impressed by the SceneSwitch bulb's brightness. Philips clocks it at 650 lumens for both the soft white and daylight settings (the same as you'd get from an incandescent), and 65 lumens for the night-light setting. In our lighting lab, we measured the soft white setting at 714 lumens, the daylight setting at 655 lumens and the night-light at 76 lumens. All three were accurate and comfortably above the target, and their color temperatures were right on the money, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only real disappointment with the bulb is that, for now, it's only available in this multitoned version with both soft white and daylight settings. The A-shaped, 60W replacement SceneSwitch LEDs that came before it also offered soft white-only and daylight-only skews that each included three different brightness settings at the same color temperature. For me, that third brightness setting is a bigger draw than switching between soft white and daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another small criticism -- like the other SceneSwitch LEDs, the SceneSwitch floodlight is pretty mediocre at making colors pop. For something with stronger color rendering capabilities, go with the GE Reveal floodlight LED or, for a few bucks less, the Walmart Great Value floodlight LED.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also worth pointing out that, because of the SceneSwitch design, this bulb will not work with traditional dimmer switches. If you use switches like that, then I'd recommend the very well-rounded Cree floodlight LED, as well as Philips' standard floodlight LED, which costs about $5 a bulb. Both scored very well in my dimming tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that aside, the SceneSwitch floodlight is a very good LED that gets just about everything right. With over 700 lumens, it's plenty bright -- and at 8W, it's also efficient enough to pay for itself in energy savings long before any new bulbs come along to render it obsolete. As gimmicks go, the ability to switch the bulb down to 10 percent brightness without need for a dimmer switch is a pretty likable one, and at just $8 per bulb, it won't cost you much extra at all. If that all sounds good to you, then you really don't have much to lose here.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We keep on seeing new smart lock options, and Otto, a keyless lock designed by a former Microsoft executive, might be the fanciest yet. It had better be -- at an asking price of $699, it's one of the most expensive smart locks we've seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios packed inside the surprisingly compact design, Otto promises to let you or anyone you choose inside with just a touch whenever it senses an authorized phone within range. Don't have your phone? Just twist and turn to enter a four-digit passcode. You can also lock and unlock Otto from anywhere using the companion app for Android and iOS devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otto's creators say that they've spent four years developing the lock, and promise that it meets the sort of standards that you have to expect from one that costs $700. For starters, it comes with complimentary concierge installation -- a very nice touch given that smart locks require a properly aligned door in order to turn smoothly on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Every door is a little different, and we want to ensure the setup process is seamless,\" an Otto spokesperson tells me. \"If it turns out that Otto doesn't fit your front door, we'll happily take it back free of charge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That complimentary concierge installation is only a limited-time offer, though -- at some point, Otto's installation partner HomeVite will charge $149 for the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otto's creators also point to the seven different grades of stainless steel used to build the lock, and the fact that it's endured extensive durability tests. They also tell us that the lock's software can distinguish between phones that are inside the home and ones that are outside, which is important -- you don't want someone to be able to open the lock simply because you left your phone sitting on an interior table within Bluetooth range.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for cyber security, they claim that Otto's asymmetric cryptography and PKI encryption have never been known to be successfully hacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "With no place to put a key, there's zero chance of anyone ever picking their way past Otto, either. That's part of the appeal of keyless locks like these, but it also puts some pressure on the developers to keep things running smoothly. Just recently, a company called LockState left hundreds of customers locked out after a botched firmware update essentially bricked people's front doors. Without a keyway, there's no real backup plan for a situation like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other potential lock-out scenario is the battery running dead, and it's more of a concern with Otto than with the competition. That's because, unlike most other smart locks, Otto includes a built-in Wi-Fi radio for remote control via the app when you're not at home. That's a nice convenience, but Wi-Fi is a bigger battery drain than Bluetooth, Z-Wave or Zigbee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otto's team tells us that the two CR123A batteries that keep the lock powered should last a couple of months -- when they're running low, you'll get an alert on your phone and on the lock itself. Fail to change them, and the lock will switch to standby mode and run using a non-rechargeable backup battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Competing keyless locks like the Kwikset Obsidian and the Yale Assure let you power the deadbolt from the outside by touching a 9V battery to a set of nodes on the bottom of the lock, but not Otto -- once that backup battery dies, the lock is completely inaccessible from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "One positive: Otto's team tells me that, once it kicks in, the backup battery can stay in standby mode for up to a year and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "You shouldn't need me to tell you that $700 is a hell of a lot to spend on a lock, but Otto wouldn't be the first product to break through from the high end. Just look at the Nest thermostat, which used a distinctive design and elegant controls to became one of the smart home's biggest success stories in spite of a relatively exorbitant price tag. Turns out that people are willing to spend on good-looking tech that'll sit in a prominent place in their home and be used every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, you could nearly buy three Nests for the price of one Otto (or three similarly featured Kwikset Kevo smart locks, for that matter), so I wouldn't expect a huge influx of sales right out of the gate. But if Otto tests well (and you can bet that we'll be testing it out in the CNET Smart Home as soon as we can), then it'll sit as a legitimately tempting splurge for anyone interested in smart locks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something else to watch for is whether or not Otto ends up syncing with any third-party smart home platforms. There's nothing like that to speak of at launch -- no Alexa, no HomeKit, no IFTTT, no nothin' -- but an Otto spokesperson tells us that those kinds of integrations are on the horizon. \"Otto was built to be updated, and integrating these platforms is definitely something we're working on in the future,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preorders for Otto are open now on Otto's website, with units expected to arrive sometime this fall. Otto is compatible with Apple devices running iOS 10 or later and Android devices running Marshmallow or better. To check if your door is compatible, click here.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the best case scenario, you wouldn't need the Wallflower. This $170, Wi-Fi-enabled smart plug connects to your electric stove and sends you alerts on your smartphone via the Wallflower app if you left your stove on when you're not home. These alerts could, in theory, prevent kitchen fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wallflower lives up to its promise to detect whether your stove is in use with little effort. It's also easy to use: Insert the Wallflower in your wall outlet, plug your electric stove into the Wallflower, connect it to your home's Wi-Fi network through the Wallflower app. When you turn your stove on, the Wallflower lets out a loud beep.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the app, you can see if your stove is in use (it doesn't differentiate between a burner or the oven being on, but it can detect when either is engaged) or still hot. You can also set cooking timers and receive notifications when the timer is up. And if you allow the Wallflower app to receive location information, it will send you a notification if the device detects that your stove is on but you're outside of a set radius of your home address.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with the Wallflower is that it doesn't do more than just tell you about the status of your stove. Unlike the $495 iGuardStove Intelligent, another safety-minded stove smart plug, the Wallflower won't automatically turn off your stove. So if you do receive an alert, you'll have to go back home or the home of a loved one to turn the stove off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wallflower will give you some peace of mind if you're the forgetful type or want to keep an eye on someone's stove usage (for example, an older adult who lives alone). Just be willing to get in your car if someone leaves a burner on.\n",

      "Available in stores in the US starting on September 25 and in Europe via Amazon and the Apple Store starting on October 1, the Aurora Rhythm will be sold two ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folks just discovering the color-changing Aurora panels can buy the Aurora Smarter Rhythm Kit for $230 (roughly £180 and AU$290 converted). It's essentially an Aurora Starter Kit bundled with an Aurora Rhythm module. Existing Aurora customers interested in this feature can buy a standalone Aurora Rhythm for $50/£40/AU$60.\n",
      "\n",

      "Orbit B-hyve\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When you first install the Orbit B-Hyve, you might not think it's that different from an ordinary sprinkler controller. The large central dial, the four large buttons and the clunky LCD display all give the impression that you're dealing with outdated technology. Indeed, Orbit's first smart sprinkler doesn't stray far from the company's non-smart options in appearance, and Orbit has been making sprinkler controllers for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way, the B-Hyve stands in stark contrast to the excellent Rachio Smart Sprinkler, which started from scratch as a smart device. Not all of the B-Hyve's differences from Rachio's sprinkler are a bad thing. If you're a fan of manual controls or you want to save money, Orbit's B-Hyve might be the better option for you than the Rachio at about twice the price (more on pricing later). You even have to pay extra for a waterproof case from Rachio. Orbit's waterproof casing is built in and part of its industrial appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Price aside, the Rachio Controller is the better smart device -- it has a wider mix of smart scheduling options and does a better job of integrating into an existing smart home setup. Taken on its own, the B-Hyve's certainly no slouch. It works with Amazon's assistant Alexa, and will schedule your sprinklers for you based on the weather. The B-Hyve is worth your consideration as a cheap, competent, but not-quite-as-smart alternative to the Rachio Controller.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only is the Orbit B-Hyve cheaper than Rachio, it's one of the least expensive smart sprinkler controllers you can find. Like most competitors in the growing smart sprinkler category, the B-Hyve replaces the existing controller for your in-ground sprinklers. Connect it to your Wi-Fi and download the B-Hyve app, and you'll be able to control your sprinklers with your phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B-Hyve also monitors the local weather, and will schedule your sprinklers for you if you'd like. Like most smart sprinklers, it's approved by the EPA WaterSense program. Head here to see if you'd qualify for a rebate on your water bill. So not only does the B-Hyve make it easier to control and schedule your sprinklers, but it can theoretically help you water more efficiently and save you money as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can buy the Orbit B-Hyve online in the US via the company's site or Amazon. It's also available in hardware stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot. The six-zone model costs $100 and the 12-zone model is $120. The B-Hyve is also available in the UK and Australia. The six-zone controller is £150 on Amazon.co.uk. The US price converts to roughly AU$130 and AU$150 for the six- and 12-zone models respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're not familiar with advanced sprinkler timers, you might be intimidated by all of the B-Hyve's options. Setup is as simple as connecting wires for power and each of your zones. If you can install a thermostat, you can install the B-Hyve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you're up and running, the left side of the screen serves as the menu. Seemingly redundant options such as \"manual,\" \"run time\" and \"start time\" make using the display confusing. So keep the instruction manual handy if you'd rather set up your schedule with the manual controls rather than the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app simplifies your options for controlling and scheduling your sprinklers, and it's generally much easier to use than the physical controls. Still, it's not perfect. I wish it showed a little more detail as far as weather info. Rachio lets you choose where you get your weather info. Orbit doesn't offer that layer of customization. The calendar could have also used an extra layer or two of info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you set a program or a schedule, you'll be able to see dots on the days when your system is set to water. Tap a day, and it'll show you the start time of each program, but you can't see much more detail than that, even if you tap the time to pull up additional details. The calendar entry never shows you a full play by play of which zones are going to run and for how long in each session.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main page of the app lets you set a rain delay, or manually turn your sprinklers on or off. You can access the details of each zone in the zone page, and set up schedules and programs in the programs page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the zones page, you can give the B-Hyve the details it needs to set your schedule for you under \"smart details.\" For each zone, you can set the soil type, plant type, sprinkler type, amount of sunlight, slope and how many sprinklers are in the zone. You can also set up catch cups to determine exactly how much water hits your yard between rain and the sprinklers for a more exact estimate of soil moisture.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're an expert, the B-Hyve has an advanced details section that lets you fine-tune stats such as \"Reference Evapotranspiration\" and \"Landscape Coefficient.\" If you don't know what those terms mean, don't worry, the B-Hyve makes an educated guess and fills in values based on the basic details you provide. Like Rachio, Orbit does a good job of combining easy-to-use options for beginners with hidden depth for experts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you get your zones set, you can turn on smart watering for each and the B-Hyve will track your soil moisture, watch the weather and water when necessary. The B-hyve specifically waters your lawn for short 10- to 15-minute bursts for each zone to prevent runoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can refine the B-Hyve's smart watering program if you have watering restrictions or preferred watering times, or let the system take care of everything for you. Alternatively, you can set up scheduled programs manually and ignore the smart feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over our two weeks of testing, the B-hyve's smart scheduling worked as well as the Rachio's and accurately responded to the weather. You can always manually run the sprinklers or put in a rain delay if it misses something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachio offers a few more scheduling options than Orbit. With the B-Hyve, you either set a smart schedule or a manual schedule. You can combine the two, but the B-Hyve warns you of the possibility of overwatering if you do that. Rachio lets you pick from a variety of fixed or flexible schedules and always offers its smarts to make sure you're not running your sprinklers in the rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachio's smart sprinkler not only offers more scheduling options than the B-hyve, it also works with several more smart home partners. Head here for Rachio's full list of compatible devices. Highlights include Amazon's Alexa and the Google Home for voice controls. You can also tie Rachio's sprinkler to your larger smart home setup with Wink, SmartThings and IFTTT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The B-Hyve also works with Amazon's Alexa, but that's it. Alexa is Amazon's digital assistant built into a variety of smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo. With a simple voice command, you can turn your B-Hyve sprinklers on or off, check when they ran last or set a rain delay. Head here for the full list of the B-Hyve's Alexa commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oddly, Alexa had a little trouble turning my sprinklers on at first. I had only used smart scheduling to that point, and if I gave the command \"Ask B-Hyve to run the sprinklers\" Alexa would agree and nothing would happen. Alexa would actually turn on the sprinkler if I said something more specific such as, \"Run station 1.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I set a few manual programs, Alexa then properly turned on the sprinklers after my first command and ran one of my established programs. Apparently, the system doesn't know what to do if you don't offer specifics and don't have any programs set. I was also initially confused because Alexa only responds to the word \"station\" and not \"zone,\" but both of these issues were minor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling Rachio's sprinkler with Alexa is more tedious. If you don't offer specifics right away, Alexa can get caught in a loop. Surprisingly, given all of Rachio's other smart home credentials, the B-Hyve's integration with Alexa works more reliably and intuitively than Rachio's. So at least the B-Hyve has a bit of quality to combat Rachio's quantity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the accurate and easy-to-use smart scheduling and the helpful Alexa skill, the Orbit B-Hyve will add a lot of convenience to your life if you're used to controlling your sprinklers with an old-fashioned timer. The price is right, as the B-Hyve's only $100 for six zones or $120 for twelve -- that's as budget-friendly as it gets for a controller with comparable smarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orbit deserves credit for successfully ushering its classic controller to the modern age while keeping the basics like manual controls intact. The B-Hyve isn't perfect and the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller is the better option if price isn't an issue. You'll also want to go with Rachio if you have lots of other smart home devices. The B-Hyve is the best option in terms of value, especially if you just want basic sprinkler smarts.\n",
      "iDevices Dimmer Switch\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of ways to put smart home tech to work, but one of the easiest and most compelling might be voice-activated control of your lights. Now, iDevices is releasing a smart dimmer switch that'll get the job done no matter which voice control platform you're using.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fittingly enough, it's called the iDevices Dimmer Switch, and it promises compatibility with Alexa, Siri and the Google Assistant for an asking price of $100. Wire it into your wall in place of one of your existing light switches, and you'll be able to program that light to turn on and off automatically, control it remotely from your phone or adjust the brightness using voice commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dimmer Switch joins a growing family of iDevices smart home gadgets that already includes a plug-in smart switch, a connected thermostat, a screw adapter for light bulbs, a smart wall outlet and more. Like the dimmer, all of them work with all three major voice control platforms, making the entire lineup accessible to just about anyone who's interested in smartening up their living space.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be an especially sound business strategy given that iDevices was recently bought out by Hubbell, a lighting and electrical manufacturer. As part of that acquisition, iDevices has pivoted slightly towards the dealer market, and begun pitching its products not only as DIY upgrades, but also as parts of professionally-installed smart home packages. Dealers like those want products that'll work with as many customers as possible, regardless of which voice assistant they prefer.\n",
      "\n",
      "That puts iDevices squarely in between those higher-end dealer setups and cheaper, self-installed gadgets like the Belkin WeMo Dimmer, which costs $80. That rival already works with Alexa and with Google, but won't work with Siri until Belkin releases its upcoming Apple HomeKit plug-in bridge later this year. Even after it arrives, the iDevices Dimmer is still likely to be the more tempting option for anyone who wants to build their smart home around Siri given that it doesn't require you to purchase any extra hardware to hop in with HomeKit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another big differentiator: the iDevices Dimmer Switch will work with three-way switch setups, where more than one light switch controls the same light or set of lights. The WeMo Dimmer doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iDevices Dimmer Switch is available now for $100. Expect us to wire one in at the CNET Smart Home for tests and a full review in the coming weeks.\n",
      "Reolink Argus Security Camera\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Reolink's Argus won't be right for everyone, but this $100 DIY security camera does fill a niche: it's affordable, battery-powered and weatherproof. The versatility of a cord-free camera means the Argus can go anywhere within range of your Wi-Fi network -- either inside or out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a serious lack of features, though. You won't find cloud recording, smart home integrations, activity zones, geofencing or a web app. It also requires four pricey and hard-to-find CR123A batteries, the same as Netgear's original $180 Arlo camera (Netgear upgraded to rechargeable batteries with its premium $250 Netgear Arlo Pro).\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the Argus is much less expensive than Netgear's Arlo lineup, as well as other battery-powered outdoor cameras like the $199 Canary Flex. If you already have a microSD card, don't care about extra features and are fine swapping out CR123A's every 6 months, Reolink's Argus might be right for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The Reolink Argus is currently only available in the US. At the current exchange rate, $100 converts to roughly £75 and AU$125.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Argus mostly holds its own alongside Netgear's Arlo Pro and Canary's Flex in the chart above. It has a higher 1080p HD resolution, a competitive six months of expected battery life, a wide viewing angle and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "But its lack of cloud storage means you must use a microSD card to save footage locally. The Argus supports up to a 64GB microSD card, but one isn't included with your purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its 1080p HD resolution comes by way of a 2-megapixel sensor and a frame rate of 15 frames per second. The 1080p HD Nest Cam Outdoor, in contrast, has a 3-megapixel sensor and 30 frames per second.\n",
      "\n",
      "While a higher frame rate requires more storage space/processing power, it also contributes to a smoother video feed. So, even though the Argus has 1080p resolution, it doesn't have the same video quality as many other 1080p cameras -- and even some 720p cameras such as the Canary Flex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Argus is a decent, less expensive way to keep an eye on your yard. And if you happen to prefer local storage, the Argus could be just the outdoor camera you're looking for. Most folks should strongly consider Netgear's Arlo, Arlo Pro and the Canary Flex first, though. All three cameras offer free cloud storage and more features than Reolink's simple $100 Argus.\n",
      "Weber Genesis II E-310\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Weber's reputation for building durable, practical outdoor grills goes back decades. Now the company wants you to think smart, too, when you think Weber. To that end, the $850 Weber Genesis II E-310 has lots of what you expect from a Weber BBQ, plus a side of app connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "To enable the smarts on this already expensive propane cooker you'll need to shell out an extra $100 for Weber's iGrill 3 accessory. It's actually a fairly useful add-on, but it's not included in the core product. Due to three powerful burners and sensitive heat controls, mastering your grilling technique on this hot-rod cooker also takes practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this makes the Genesis II suited to more experienced grill enthusiasts with the patience to master this high-end unit. If smarts in a more forgiving high-end grill is what you want, the $800 Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared is slightly cheaper and easier to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate how sturdy and solid the Genesis II feels. Its lid and pair of side tables are built from heavy steel. Both the grill's cast iron grates and lid are enameled in porcelain too. My only complaint, a minor one, is Weber's choice to use some plastic in the E-310's construction. The ends of the grill's side tables are wrapped in gray plastic bumpers that cheapens its appearance. The same goes for the plastic trim on the lid. Still, the lid does have a large built-in thermometer, a Weber standard feature the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared lacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Genesis II relies on what Weber calls the \"GS4 High Performance Grilling System,\" which involves three propane burners each rated at a robust 37,500 BTU. That's plenty of heating power to have at your disposal. The Char-Broil SmartChef, by comparison, has three gas burners as well, but they provide less oomph at just 25,000 BTU apiece. You do get a small side burner with Char-Broil's SmartChef grill, a feature Weber includes on various grills across its product lines, but not on this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both grills differ in the way they cook your food. The Genesis II uses wedge-shaped bars to cover and protect its burners from grease and drippings. The bars also act as deflectors to spread heat evenly across the grilling surface above as well. All three burners are lit by the same ignition module and its corresponding igniter button. You have to supply it with AA disposable batteries, as you do with most other propane grills. Each of the burners have their own weather-resistant electrodes, however, to improve reliability. Weber refers to the design as \"Infinity Ignition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The SmartChef protects its burners with similar protective bars, though it calls them \"heat tents.\" Char-Broil also introduces a second part in the mix, a thin steel plate just below its grates and above the burners. A component in Char-Broil's \"Tru-Infrared\" grilling system, the plate is designed to absorb the heat from the burners, and use it to mimic the radiant heat you get from charcoal. The different cooking methods likely explain the results of my cooking tests, too. I'll get to that soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "One huge advantage of Weber's Genesis II grill design is it's a snap to clean. It has large parts, and only a few of them. They're also spaced out well so pulling the machine apart for maintenance is easy. Weber also built an elegant grease management system at the heart of the cooker. Any juices and drippings that make it past the burners are funneled towards a waiting disposable drip tray for collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Weber Genesis II E-310 is among just a few backyard grills that support smart technology. Weber didn't create this tech on its own -- it acquired the iGrill brand from iDevices, a line of Bluetooth, app-connected thermometers, including the $50 iGrill Mini.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest product to join the iGrill line postacquisition is the $100 iGrill 3, and it works as an add-on to Weber's Genesis II and Genesis II LX grills that fits into a physical socket on the front of those units. Weber pushes the iGrill 3 as an upgrade meant for its Genesis II grills alone but aside from the tailored receptacle, it will work fine with any brand of grill, it just won't have a dedicated slot to mount it securely.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the various iGrill models link to the Weber mobile app, which lets you monitor the Genesis II wirelessly from a distance of 30 feet. The scope of the app is narrow compared to Char-Broil's SmartChef application. SmartChef tackles lots of things besides food. It tracks propane levels, burner status and even tells you if the grill is cool enough to cover. Weber's app just sticks to measuring temperatures of meat, fish and poultry as you cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless I prefer Weber's targeted approach and the iGrill software overall. The app is intuitive, cleanly organized and uncluttered. Barbecue enthusiasts will enjoy the handy graph that extrapolates when your meal will be done based on current conditions. My favorite feature is how the software pings you when you're 10 degrees out from your probe's target temp. It then pings you each time the thermometer rises by 1 degree until your food is done.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application's connection to its probes was continuous and always ready to display temperatures in real time. By contrast the Char-Broil SmartChef app usually lost temperature probe data if I closed it or simply opened another application on my phone (a Google Pixel XL). Another advantage the iGrill app has over SmartChef is a simple wizard to setup probes to actively monitor your food while it cooks. For example, you can select the food type (chicken, burgers, steak and so on) and iGrill knows what target temperature you need to hit. You can also choose the level of doneness you'd like and the app adapts accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a big catch though. To add smarts to the Genesis II you'll need to purchase the iGrill 3 accessory separately, a $100 upgrade. All of the Char-Broil SmartChef grill's technology comes built-in. Still, especially if you're a new to grilling or you simply like to cook with precision, the iGrill 3 is a worthwhile addition to this or any other grill, since it makes cooking tricky items such as poultry and big cuts of steak safer and easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grilling on the Weber Genesis II takes practice. I learned that while its burners are mighty, they also offer a wide temperature range which can be unforgiving if you're not careful. For example, when I turned the Genesis II's burner dials all the way up, after 10 minutes the temperature under the hood easily cracked 600 degrees (633.7 in fact). That same high setting and preheat time on the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared yielded an internal temp of 457.4 degrees. Likewise, medium power on the Genesis, especially cooking with indirect heat, was much cooler than I expected. This resulted in unacceptably long cooking times even when all its burner knob markings were parked dead center of its dial.\n",
      "\n",
      "To measure how grills perform under high heat conditions, I subjected them to our burger test. This exercise shows how much raw power a grill can bring to the table. I ran three such tests of six 5.3-ounce burgers each pressed from the same hamburger press. I flipped all of the burners on high and gave the grill 10 minutes to preheat.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that I arranged the patties on the grill in a rectangular pattern (two patties high, three across) with 1.5 to 2 inches spacing between them. I inserted one of the iGrill probes into the center, front patty. I closed the hood, and gave the burgers a flip after 6 minutes. With the lid closed again, I recorded how long it took the internal burger temp to hit 145 degrees. The Genesis II took 10 minutes and 10 seconds for its burgers to finish, just 5 seconds faster than the Char-Broil SmartChef Tru-Infrared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Genesis II produced patties with a decent crust but considerable char too. Searing for too long or at too high heat levels gives food burnt charcoal flavors I'd rather do without. Unfortunately the insides of these burgers were also on the dry side. By contrast I found the burgers from the Char-Broil grill juicier, and with more flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Genesis II turned in mixed results on our beer can chicken test, designed to assess how well a grill operates at medium heat. I again used one of the grill's probes to tell me when the internal temperature reached 165 degrees. I also set the left and right burners to the midway mark as indicated by on their dials. Since indirect heat is the goal here, I left the center burner off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually a 5 to 6 pound bird takes anywhere from 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours to finish cooking. Unfortunately the Genesis failed this first attempt, requiring almost 4 hours for its probe to hit the magic number. The temperature inside the grill box hovered at around 250 degrees with the left and right burner dials at the medium setting. It also took a long 55 minutes to reach this temp. After seeing the test through to the end (when the probes hit the temp), the chicken was inedible. Its skin was as leathery as a football and the flesh inside was watery, mushy and thoroughly unappetizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the second test, I bumped up the dials a tiny fraction above their midpoint, and the temperature inside the grill rocketed up to 460 degrees in 30 minutes where it stayed. The bird hit 165 in a quick 1 hour 14 minutes. Its skin was nicely roasted and crisp too. The dark meat was especially tender and moist. White meat from the breast was slightly dry, however, and overcooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used a rack of pork ribs for our low temperature test. For this test I started all three of the grill's burners and left them running full blast for 10 minutes (lid closed). In the meantime, I seasoned one rack of St. Louis-style pork spareribs (3.6 pounds) with ordinary dry rub mix sourced from the local supermarket.\n",
      "\n",
      "I draped the ribs across the Genesis II's metal warming tray that sits above the grill grates. Finally I dialed all three burner knobs down to their lowest setting and closed the lid. I cooked two racks this way; the first I ran for 3 hours, the second for 3 hours 30 minutes. On both the CharBroil SmartChef and Weber Genesis II, the ribs were too thin to shield their probes from ambient hot air under the lid. As a result I fell back to cooking by time instead of hitting a target thermometer reading. Both grills turned in slightly underdone ribs after a 3-hour cook, so I bumped the time up another 30 minutes for round two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to how this Weber grill treated burgers, the Genesis II pumped out more heat than was necessary. On both the 3 hour and the 3 hour 30 minute runs, the ribs were good but too crisp and dry for my taste. The solution lies with some different combination of cooking time and temperature, but within the confines of the time allotted for this review, I had to stop there. The takeaway is that you can expect some trial and error before you find the path to delicious ribs from this Weber.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, the Char-Broil SmartChef over the same time period came out much better. Same prepackaged ribs from Costco, same dry rub seasoning. Especially at the longer cook time, the CharBroil ribs were dripping with moisture and succulent. Yum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weber is one of the most popular grill brands in the US. That's why I'm surprised by the unpredictable behavior the $850 Weber Genesis II E-310 demonstrated on our tests. This isn't to say this is a bad product, it's simply that you'll likely need to learn its quirks before you achieve the best grilling results.\n",
      "\n",
      "For that reason, splurging on the Genesis II's $100 iGrill 3 smart accessory could make sense. It will certainly take the guesswork out of learning its temperature settings. Still, $950 all-in is a heck of a lot of cash to spend on a grill, especially for the more casual outdoor cook.\n",
      "Sylvania Smart Multicolor LED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Connected lighting is often a simple smart home starting point, and Sylvania's new Apple HomeKit-compatible, color-changing smart bulb wants to be as simple as it gets. With a Bluetooth radio built into each bulb, there's no need to plug a hub into your router -- just screw in, turn on, and sync with Siri. The cost? $45 per bulb.\n",
      "\n",
      "That HomeKit compatibility means that you'll control the bulb on your iOS device using Apple's Home app instead of a dedicated Sylvania app. The Home app lets you control the Sylvania bulb alongside other Apple-friendly gadgets, and it also lets you pin quick bulb controls to your phone's Control Center, or control the bulb using spoken Siri commands. That includes changing the color of the bulb, but those controls don't go as deep as what you'll find in the apps for Lifx or Philips Hue, where color-changing light controls are the core feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Sylvania's LED costs a little less than Lifx or Hue, and while $45 is still a lot to spend on a light bulb, Sylvania's positioned itself pretty well here -- especially as an alternative for Apple loyalists looking to build a smart home around Siri. It that sounds like you, and smart, color-changing light is something you're willing to spend on, then give this light a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most every LED light bulb, the Sylvania Smart Plus LED uses a fraction of the energy needed to power a common incandescent bulb, but still claims to put out the same level of brightness -- 800 lumens, per Sylvania. I used our integrating sphere and spectrometer to test that claim, and clocked the default, soft white setting at 755 lumens -- just within the margin of error of that 800-lumen claim. It's not as bright as the Lifx LED, which gets up over 1,000 lumens at its default setting, but it's a bit brighter than Philips Hue, and plenty bright to call itself a 60W replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though accurate, Sylvania's colors were much less bright, ranging between roughly 80 and 200 lumens depending on the shade. That's typical of color-changing bulbs like these, since the majority of the brightness comes from the white-light diodes. Still, it's worth noting that Lifx offers a lot more oomph across the spectrum, and also lets you add the white light in on top of the colors for brighter, more subtle tints. It's still the smart bulb I'd recommend for people who just want the brightest, best-looking colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lifx and Hue also offer dedicated, fully featured apps for color control, as well as a wide range of integrations with third-party platforms and devices. Both work with Alexa and with Google Home for voice-activated color changes, both will sync up with the Nest Learning Thermostat, and both have channels on the free online automation service IFTTT. Hue already works with HomeKit, too, and HomeKit support for Lifx bulbs, though long delayed at this point, is still in the cards, as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "By comparison, Sylvania leans entirely on HomeKit, and on the Home app for quick lighting controls. It doesn't work with Alexa or with the Google Assistant or with third-party platforms like SmartThings and Wink (though it's important to note that Sylvania also sells a nearly identical, non-HomeKit-compatible smart bulb that works with all of those. Yes, it's a bit confusing).\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, the focus on HomeKit makes the bulb a good fit if you're already using a variety of Siri-compatible gadgets and just want to add color-changing light into the mix. However, if you want deep, fully featured color control to be a centerpiece of your smart home, then the Home app leaves a lot to be desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes a good first impression, though. To pair the bulb, you'll just screw it in and turn it on, then tap the little plus sign icon in the Home app. You'll point your phone's camera at the eight-digit pairing code in the Sylvania manual, then let the app do the rest. I had my test bulb up and running in under a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "From there, you can use the assign the bulb to a room to group it with other HomeKit devices, or tap to turn it on and off or adjust its brightness. You can switch the color or color temperature, too, though the controls are pretty rudimentary. You won't find additional options for matching the color of a photograph, or customizing a color cycle, for instance. And, if you want to control your bulb remotely when you're out of Bluetooth range, you'll need an Apple TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling the bulb with Siri is pretty straightforward provided you give it a name that's easy for her to recognize. I did notice a few voice control hiccups, though -- namely, Siri hearing the word \"red\" as \"read\" and messing up my color changes. Alexa and the Google Assistant both seem to have those sorts of kinks worked out already.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sylvania Smart Plus LED is the first color-changing bulb that doesn't need a hub to work with HomeKit, which gives it an edge over Philips Hue. At $45 each, it costs a little less than Lifx, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trade-off is that it isn't as fully featured as either of those, but if HomeKit-supported color changes are all you want, then you might not notice or care. If you're itching for Siri-powered smart lighting, it's certainly worthy of consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Editor's note, 8/16/17, 9:55 AM: This review initially stated that the Sylvania Smart Plus LED uses a built-in Wi-Fi radio. That was incorrect -- it connects with users' phones and with the Apple TV for remote connections using a Bluetooth radio. The text of the review has been updated accordingly. The score and recommendation remain unchanged, though it's worth pointing out that without an Apple TV, you'll be unable to control this bulb on your phone from outside of Bluetooth range (roughly 100 feet).\n",
      "Honeywell Lyric C1 Wi-Fi Security Camera\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So many of today's DIY security cameras cost $200 -- or more. Fortunately, an increasing number of manufacturers are selling models for less. Honeywell's $120 Lyric C1 Wi-Fi Security Camera is the latest example. Its main features include 720p HD live streaming, free cloud storage, local storage via an included 8GB microSD card and motion and sound alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indoor-only C1 also adds in two motion detection zones, geofencing capabilities and the promise of upcoming smart home integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn't an exciting or particularly innovative camera, but the price is right, particularly if you're looking for extras like geofencing and an included microSD card. At the current exchange rate, $120 converts to roughly £90 and AU$150.\n",
      "\n",
      "When compared alongside some other security cameras in a similar price range -- the iSmartAlarm Spot and the Zmodo Pivot -- the C1 doesn't stand out very much. But it has a couple of bonus features: motion zones and geofencing. Motion zones let you customize what areas in your camera's field of view actually detect and alert you to unexpected activity. Geofencing automatically turns your camera on and off whenever you leave and return home (based on your phone's location). Honeywell is also working on smart home integrations for this camera. Honeywell's Lyric T5 thermostat already works with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, IFTTT and Google Home, so hopefully similar pairings are in the works for their C1 camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main question, though, is whether the C1 is better than iSmartAlarm's Spot. The C1 costs a little more, but comes with an included microSD card, zones and geofencing. It doesn't have as many smart home integrations as Spot, but that could soon change. Ultimately, both cameras are decent options -- consider what features matter most to you and go from there.\n",
      "SimpliSafe SimpliCam\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The $100 SimpliCam is SimpliSafe's long-awaited response to customers wanting a camera as part of their home security setup. Buy one (or several) to accompany your DIY SimpliSafe system -- or just use them as standalone cameras.\n",
      "\n",
      "While 100 bucks is a pretty good price for a 720p live-streaming camera, SimpliSafe borrows the same surprisingly rigid fee model from its existing system. That means it charges (optional, but largely necessary) monthly fees, even for the most basic features. Want to view live video via the web app? There's a monthly fee. How about event-based cloud video storage? Yep, same deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that so many other DIY security systems -- and cameras -- exist in the market, SimpliSafe's approach is growing increasingly stale. Live streaming and other standard features worked fine for me, but is this thing worth $100 (roughly £75 and AU$125 converted)? Absolutely not.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reviewing the key features offered on three DIY indoor cameras that cost at or under $100, SimpliSafe's SimpliCam clearly lags behind. The $60 Lynx camera by Tend Secure has the best price, resolution and free cloud storage offering. It has pretty solid facial recognition capabilities, too -- also totally free. iSmartAlarm's Spot wins in terms of storage choices, since it comes with cloud and local storage (the microSD card is not included). Spot also works with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT for creating advanced smart home automations.\n",
      "\n",
      "SimpliCam just doesn't do enough to justify its purchase. That's particularly true when you compare it to other security cameras in roughly the same price range. Would you rather have free cloud storage or pay $5 per month for it? The choice is simple.\n",
      "Eufy Genie\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Genie is an Alexa-enabled smart speaker that'll sell for just $35. It's the newest gadget in Anker's Eufy range of smart home products, which Anker -- previously best known for making USB chargers -- kicked off last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a nutshell, the Genie is just a cheaper version of the Amazon Echo Dot. You'll plug it in, sync it up with your home network, then tell it to stream some music, play a podcast, turn your lights off, set a timer, or anything else you might think to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "It includes the same far-field microphones that can hear you from across the room whenever you say the wake word \"Alexa.\" It works with the same services and smart home products. It features the same access to more than 10,000 free Alexa skills, each of which teaches Alexa to do something new. It's everything people like about Amazon's voice assistant in a slightly more affordable package.\n",
      "\n",
      "With its 2W speaker, Eufy also promises \"better sound,\" though the press release never specifies what it's actually better than. At 70 percent of the Echo Dot's cost, I'd be satisfied if the sound was 70 percent as strong, but that wouldn't be saying much given that the Dot's puny speaker wasn't designed to fill a room. At any rate, the sound quality might be a moot point since, like the Dot, you can connect the Genie to external speakers using a 3.5mm cable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real idea is that the Genie will serve as the centerpiece to a new suite of Eufy smart home gadgets. First up are Wi-Fi-enabled Eufy Lumos smart bulbs coming at the end of August, available in standard white for $20 each or tunable white for $30. A new, app-enabled version of Eufy's RoboVac will come next in September -- you'll be able to buy it bundled with the Genie for just $280, which is about as affordable as voice-connected housecleaning currently gets. Eufy-branded smart plugs, smart switches, and smart light strips are in the works, too. You'll be able to control all of it using the Eufy app or by talking to Alexa, which, conveniently enough, positions the Genie right at the crossroads.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that makes Eufy something of an Alexa budget brand. It's hard not to call the Genie a pure Echo Dot knockoff, and with the same, voice-activated Alexa smarts as the Dot, the two might as well be functionally identical. The only real difference: The $35 Genie doesn't include support for wireless Bluetooth connections with external speakers. For that, you'll have to wait for a $40 version of the Genie with Bluetooth that's still listed as \"coming soon.\" Hm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't expect Amazon to complain about the copycat design, though. Shortly after the initial success of the original Amazon Echo smart speaker, the online retail giant made the software that powers Alexa available to outside developers for use in their own products. With a few lines of code, any gadget with a microphone, a speaker, and an internet connection can be an  Alexa gadget. That means more competition for the Echo and Echo Dot, but it also helps Amazon build the overall Alexa user base.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With the Eufy Genie, customers can get Alexa, her 15,000+ skills, and high-quality sound for less than $35,\" said Steve Rabuchin, VP Amazon Alexa. \"Now even more customers will be able to simply ask Alexa to set a timer, play the news or their favorite music, control their smart home or order a meal with just their voice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Building that base of customers is clearly Amazon's top priority for Alexa as it fights to secure as big a share of the red-hot voice control market as it can. To that end, you'll find third-party Alexa gadgets like the Genie for sale on Amazon itself -- and virtually no sign of the Google Home smart speaker (or, presumably, the Apple HomePod smart speaker later this year). The automaker Henry Ford once famously quipped that his customers could get a Model T in any color they liked, so long as it was black. Amazon might well joke that shoppers can get a smart speaker of any brand that they like -- so long as it's Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $35 Eufy Genie goes up for sale -- on Amazon -- on August 16. Prices and release dates for the rest of the Eufy smart home lineup are listed below.\n",

      "Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller Generation 2\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of smart home devices promise to revolutionize the ordinary with convenience you didn't know you needed. The Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller actually fulfills that promise. Buy it, and you'll no longer have to mess with the confusing dials and buttons of an ordinary sprinkler controller. Turn on your sprinklers with an app, or a voice command to the Amazon Echo or the Google Home. Better yet, let Rachio plan when to turn on your sprinklers for you based on the weather, and save money on water in the meantime.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not without its flaws -- the voice controls are wonky, you can't do much with the onboard controls if your internet is out, and you can't run multiple zones at once -- but generally, the $200 to $250 Rachio 2nd Generation Smart Sprinkler Controller succeeds at what it sets out to do. If you have an in-ground sprinkler system, the Rachio Controller is a great buy for the convenience it will add to your watering routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're ready to upgrade, know that the Rachio Controller isn't the only game in town. Fortunately, Rachio stacks up well next to the smart competition too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost all smart sprinklers replace an existing controller for your in ground sprinkler system. Then, they connect to your home's Wi-Fi network, offer app controls, and help you save water by monitoring the weather and helping you adapt your schedule to accommodate for rain. Better yet, most smart controllers qualify for the EPA's WaterSense program, allowing you to get rebates on your utility bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachio does all of that, and separates itself with its extra smart home integrations. It works with both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home (both are always-listening speakers that respond to voice commands). It also works with the Nest Learning Thermostat, the online rule making platform IFTTT, and the Wink and SmartThings smart home ecosystems. Head here for a full list of Rachio's integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other smart sprinklers work with the Amazon Echo too, and the $250 GreenIQ has an impressive list of integrations of its own, but Rachio's list is the best of the bunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can purchase the second-generation Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller now from the company's website. It's also available from Amazon, Home Depot, Best Buy and Lowes. An 8-zone controller costs $200 or you can buy a 16-zone unit for $250. If you'll be replacing an outdoor controller, you'll also need Rachio's $30 weatherproof casing. The Rachio Controller will work in any country, but Rachio has distribution only in North America for now. The US price converts to roughly £150 and AU$250 for the 8-zone version and £190/AU$315 for 16 zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tested Rachio at the CNET Smart Home over the course of two weeks. The physical setup is roughly on the same do-it-yourself skill level as replacing your thermostat. Then, the app does the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "After you use the app to connect Rachio to Wi-Fi, you can hop right in and start using the controller, or you can let Rachio walk you through setting up the different zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachio's app shines both when you're setting up the zones, and when you're scheduling them. With both processes, the app puts simple, easy-to-understand options at the forefront of its interface, with plenty of room for advanced customization hidden just underneath the surface. It balances ease-of-use with depth perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zone setup asks you to name each zone, then asks you what's growing there, what type of soil it's in, how much sun it gets, what type of sprinkler head you have in the zone, and the slope of the zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, you can skip the zone-by-zone setup and jump straight to scheduling if you'd like, but the extra details help Rachio plan for you. You can fine-tune beyond the basics if you'd like. Click on a zone in the app and you can tinker with details like root depth and crop coefficient if you're an expert. The details section also shows you the moisture level, and you can see it charted over time and tweak it as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have the zones set the way you want them, you can schedule your sprinklers from the main page of the app according to your local restrictions, as well as your needs and preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachio offers four scheduling options:\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, you can have as much input in designing your sprinkler schedule as you'd like, and Rachio will help out with its own smarts as much as it can. For comparison, the Orbit B-Hyve sprinkler lets you design your own schedule, or it'll do it for you. If you schedule yourself, you need to tell Orbit when to set a rain delay. Rachio's ready to offer automatic assistance on any schedule you set.\n",
      "\n",
      "I set up a \"Flexible Daily\" schedule for the CNET Smart Home. I wanted to see how Rachio would do with full control over when to run the sprinklers. Even with this option, you can still specify water restriction days and your preferred start time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachio starts off Flexible Daily by running a long cycle on each zone -- enough to get each zone from 0 percent to 100 percent moisture. Your lawn probably isn't at 0 when Rachio starts, but this way the system knows your lawn is all the way at one end of the spectrum and can start predicting accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that first long run, Rachio spread out its watering over the course of the next week -- usually running one zone a day and breaking up watering times even for that single zone to let the water sink in. The system also recognized when it was raining and pushed back the scheduled days accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can change where Rachio gets it weather info in the app, but weirdly, the Flexible Daily schedule never shows that you \"saved\" any water. The bottom of the main page shows water used and water saved per month, but with Flexible Daily, the second number remained zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's an odd quirk, since Rachio should be saving you the most with this option, but it's also not cancelling sessions based on rain and thus saving water. It's just not scheduling sessions for rainy days in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachio's design and app have a few other minor flaws. I generally like the elegant simplicity of the controller itself -- it looks futuristic without being over-the-top -- but the onboard controls are pretty minimal so you won't be able to do much at all if your internet goes out.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't run multiple zones at once. Even if you use the remote control in the app to start all zones watering for five minutes, Rachio will cycle through five minutes of each zone one at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The watering and schedule updates are confusing, with two or three redundant entries for each time you turn on your sprinkler. The push notifications are better, and customizable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of my issues with Rachio are minor and you won't often notice them, especially once you have your schedule running. Rachio's integrations with the Amazon Echo and Google Home are more problematic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling your sprinklers with your voice definitely has a cool factor, but Rachio's skills for both the Echo and the Home need polish. They work fine when you know the exact phrase you need to say, but improvise and Amazon's assistant can get caught in a loop and the Google Home will get confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second-generation Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller isn't perfect, and it's a little expensive at $200 for an 8-zone model and $250 for 16. The Blossom 8 gives you 8 zones of connected control for $150; the Orbit B-Hyve offers 12 zones of control for only $120. If you're weighing Rachio against other smart sprinklers, Rachio's app is mostly excellent. It keeps setup simple enough for beginners while offering depth for experts that want it. Plus, Rachio works with more smart home partners than the sprinkler competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're considering whether you need an upgrade at all, rest assured that Rachio's smarts aren't just for show. After a brief setup, Rachio can take care of most of your scheduling for you, and you can quickly make adjustments with the responsive app. All told, using Rachio will be exponentially easier than fiddling with the dials and buttons of an old-fashioned controller. So as a smart device that truly feels smart, I'm happy to recommend Rachio to anyone with an inground sprinkler system and a solid Wi-Fi network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fixed interval: Pick how often you want your lawn watered. You can also set your system to water on even or odd days. Rachio will skip days when appropriate based on the weather.Fixed days: Pick the days of the week you'd like to water. Again, Rachio will help out by skipping days when appropriate.Flexible monthly: Rachio determines a predictable schedule for you based on your zone input, the weather and the season. Flexible daily: Rachio ditches all predictability and adapts dynamically to the weather and your yard's conditions. It waters when necessary based on the moisture levels of your zones.\n",
      "Oomi Home Starter Kit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Editor's Note, 11/1/17, 5:25 PM EST: Oomi has lowered the price of its starter kit in the US from $700 to $500. That's still expensive, but not unreasonably so given Oomi's versatility. We've raised the score from a 7.4 to a 7.7 as a result; the full review, as originally published, follows below.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've seen no shortage of smart home starter kits over the past few years, and Oomi, an Indiegogo success story and perennial favorite at CES, is one of the more ambitious.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to color-changing smart bulbs and attractive-looking smart plugs, Oomi's starter kit offers a Piper-like camera embedded with sensors and smarts. It's also got a sophisticated rules engine and a dedicated tablet controller that doubles as a universal remote. Along with automating all of it and using Oomi as a DIY security system, you can sync the starter kit with Alexa for voice controls, or put your Nest thermostat, Philips Hue bulbs and Z-Wave devices under Oomi's control. All of Oomi's gadgets have near-field communication (NFC) built in, so you can connect each device just by tapping it with the tablet.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a \"but\" coming, though, and it's a big one. Sure, Oomi is a likable smart home system, but it costs $700. I rarely get to use exclamation points in my reviews, so allow me to seize the opportunity: $700!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oomi points to the versatility of the system to justify the expense. That's all well and good, but consider this. If you swapped an Amazon Echo Show in for Oomi's touchscreen controller, two color-changing Lifx LEDs for the bulbs, a Nest Cam for the Oomi Cube and a Belkin WeMo Mini in place of Oomi's smart plug, the total cost would be about $560 -- and that's if you bought everything at full price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By piecemealing a system together, you don't get the simplicity that Oomi provides,\" counters Colin Marshall, vice president of Oomi's parent company Fantem. He also points to Oomi-specific features such as its compatibility with Z-Wave devices and the multitude of sensors packed into the Oomi Cube. It's a fair point to an extent, but it doesn't make the price tag any easier to swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that said, I like Oomi, and think it could have been an interesting competitor to names such as SmartThings and Wink a couple of years ago. But today there are simply too many strong alternatives that cost less for most people to justify spending so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oomi's starter kit ships out in a distinctive black box with gilded, Gucci-esque lettering. The first impression is a far cry from the plasticky white hardware of Wink and SmartThings -- by comparison, Oomi's weighty devices feel refined and maybe even a little bit haughty.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll start by plugging in the tablet's fancy, magnetic charging dock and powering it up. From there, it'll walk you through the setup process, which is one of the easiest I've ever experienced from a starter kit of this kind thanks to the NFC radios built into each device. Just tell the tablet you're adding something, then tap it against the gadget you want to add. There's no scanning, no temporary Wi-Fi networks to join and no access codes to enter. Just super simple setup by way of physical proximity. (I should point out that this makes for a system that's less vulnerable to outside hacks.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Oomi's devices use a wireless language called Z-Wave to communicate with each other. The nice thing about that is that they don't rely on your home's Wi-Fi network for anything other than letting you connect with the system from afar. They'll still be able to talk to each other if your Wi-Fi goes down, and any automations you've programmed should continue to run like normal. Another benefit: You can connect a wide range of third-party Z-Wave devices with Oomi, most of which cost less than adding extra a-la-carte Oomi gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "With your devices up and running and the tablet calling the shots, you can create an Oomi account and download the Oomi app to your phone to control things from there. One complaint about the app: You can view any automations you've programmed on the tablet (the lights turning on when motion is detected, for instance) and you can turn those automations on and off. But you can't edit those automations and you can't create new ones. You're forced to use the tablet for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least that automation engine is well designed. In addition to selecting custom triggers and resulting actions for each automated rule, you can also set conditions -- rules that only run during certain times of day, for example. Those conditions give you the flexibility you need to customize those automations as you see fit. It's just a shame you can't do so from your phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The centerpiece of the setup isn't the tablet, though -- it's the Oomi Cube camera, which doubles as Oomi's Z-Wave hub. In addition to featuring night vision and letting you check the camera feed on the tablet or on your phone, it's also packed with sensors for things like light, motion and air quality, as well as a siren that'll sound if it spots movement while the system is armed. The camera's image quality wasn't quite as sharp as you'll get with the Nest Cam, however, and I noticed a persistent delay of about five seconds in my feed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cube also uses its infrared light to communicate with audio-visual gear and television sets. That lets you link the physical buttons on the tablet with the physical buttons on, say, your TV remote. From there, the Cube will act as middleman, relaying those button presses on your tablet to the TV, and effectively letting you use it as a universal remote. Programming everything was easy when I connected Oomi with the Roku TV in the CNET Smart Apartment bedroom, but there was a noticeable delay when I tried pressing buttons as I tested it out. Your mileage may vary depending on your AV gear, but for me it's a feature I'd try once and then probably never use again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulbs were better performers, reliably turning on and off and changing colors whenever I wanted. I appreciated that you can pick out a custom color pattern for each bulb to cycle through, but I wish that the colors themselves were a bit brighter. Still, they're perfectly decent smart bulbs, and a nice inclusion in the starter kit, since color-changing bulbs are typically smart home extras that you have to splurge on in and of themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the plug, it did a fine job of turning a desk fan of mine on and off as needed. With a glowing ring of LEDs and a USB port on the side for charging devices, it's a smart, well-designed device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oomi also offers integrations with three notable smart home platforms: Nest, Philips Hue and Amazon's Alexa. The first two let you put third-party thermostats and lightbulbs under Oomi's control. As for Amazon, you can enable the Oomi skill in the Alexa app then ask the virtual voice assistant to run your preset scenes or turn devices on and off. I wasn't able to test it out, though -- the Oomi skill is still in beta, and not officially up and running just yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oomi tries to do an awful lot -- security, automation, entertainment controls, color-changing light -- and some of those efforts are more successful than others. I love the use of NFC for easy pairing, and little details like the smart plug's USB charging port show that Oomi's creators put a lot of thought into their product. Other features, such as the universal remote functionality, feel a bit tacked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I just can't get past the price tag. At $700, Oomi needs to offer more than versatility for versatility's sake. As DIY, do-it-all smart home systems go, it's a very good one, but the asking price is tough to stomach. Unless you're willing to spend extra in order to unify your gadgets and automated rules within one app, I'd recommend shopping around for something less expensive.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "HVAC manufacturer Lennox also sells a variety of air quality and heating and cooling accessories through its list of approved dealers. Their newest product, the iComfort E30, is a $360 touchscreen thermostat touting a variety of smart features. This model is currently only available in the US; $360 converts to roughly £275 and AU$455 at the current exchange rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, and perhaps most importantly, you don't need a Lennox-brand HVAC system to operate the iComfort E30. The official press release says this thermostat will work with \"any brand of HVAC system,\" although it is also compatible with the Lennox iHarmony Zoning System.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iComfort E30 also works with Amazon's Alexa-powered voice control speakers. While that shows Lennox understands the growing demand for smart home partnerships in everyday devices, many of today's connected thermostats work with more than one platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honeywell on Wednesday added Google Home integration to its Lyric thermostats (prices start at $150), which already integrate with Alexa and Apple's Siri-based HomeKit software (Apple is expected to debut its own standalone smart speaker, the $349 HomePod, in December).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nest's $249 Learning thermostat works with Alexa and Google Home and the Editors' Choice Award-winning $249 Ecobee4 thermostat integrates with a long list of platforms, including functioning as an Alexa speaker itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why should anyone spend $360 on the iComfort E30, in addition to paying a dealer-assigned electrician for the installation?\n",
      "\n",
      "The thermostat's \"Perfect Temp\" and \"Feels Like\" features sound intriguing. Essentially, they are supposed to consider the indoor and outdoor temperatures, as well as the indoor humidity to determine ideal heating and cooling settings for that particular day. Lennox can also supposedly track your home and away status using your phone's GPS and auto-adjust your heat and A/C accordingly. The iComfort E30 tracks outdoor air quality levels, too, and will turn on the fan automatically when pollen and other allergen levels are high.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm still not convinced this thermostat is worth its $360 price, but am curious if its \"Feels Like\" feature really can account for regular day-to-day temperature and humidity changes. We've requested a review unit, so stay tuned for our hands-on impressions.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a quick detour into the smart home aisle at your local hardware store and you're sure to see plenty of smart locks for your front door. But what about your garage? Doesn't the biggest, most visible door into your home deserve some consideration, too?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the thinking behind Liftmaster's newest product, an automatic garage door lock that promises to bring some peace of mind to the place where you park your car. Essentially just a big, automated deadbolt for your garage door, the Liftmaster lock works like any garage door lock, except for the fact that you can automate it to lock and unlock automatically, or control it remotely using a smart phone app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liftmaster's selling the lock through a network of dealers as part of its latest automated garage entry systems. Specifically, it's compatible with Liftmaster's Wi-Fi-enabled 8550W and 8360W openers, as well as the new 8587W. Prices will vary by dealer, but buying the lock packaged with one of those openers will set you back somewhere around $650 once installation is factored in. And no, the lock isn't available on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, that's a lot more than you'll spend on a retrofit smart garage opener like Garageio (about $200) or Liftmaster's own MyQ Garage (about $100). Neither of those will actually lock your garage door, though -- they only let you open and close it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding a lock into that equation seems perfectly sensible to me, but it might be a hard purchase to justify when standard garage door locks typically don't cost much more than twenty bucks. Shop around, and you'll also find automated locks that you can install yourself for less than $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding an automated lock like that to a product like MyQ Garage and selling them as a bundle for more like $200 might have been a better approach, but it's clear Liftmaster is targeting the high-end market to start with. That may very well establish this lock as a smart garage status symbol, but it may also lock out a lot of DIY-minded customers who would have otherwise been receptive to Liftmaster's pitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Automatic Garage Door Lock is available now through Liftmaster's network of dealers, which you can browse here.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart outlets aren't a new thing. We've seen everything from plug-in models like the Belkin Wemo Insight Switch to Insteon's in-wall On/Off Outlet. These simple, functional devices give you remote access to whatever you plug into them via your phone and voice commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Startup Swidget took the Insteon approach with its hardwired Swidget Outlet, available for preorder now on Kickstarter starting at $38 (roughly £30 and AU$50 converted). But instead of basic on-off outlet control, Swidget plans to offer modular inserts. A lot of modular inserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the insert options Swidget has in the works:\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is that you'll be able to quickly and easily swap in one accessory for another with minimal effort. And, bonus: They'll be offered in both Wi-Fi and Z-Wave versions. The Wi-Fi attachments are designed to work directly with the related Swidget app, whereas you'll need a compatible hub for Z-Wave integration, such as SmartThings.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this is a unique approach to a smart outlet, I'm not sold on Swidget. When the device is scheduled to ship to backers worldwide in June 2018, it will only come with the \"outlet control\" insert. The other inserts are expected to be sold separately after the campaign period ends. Swidget is also offering a developer kit for anyone interested in designing their own accessories.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since outlet control is the bare minimum requirement for any smart outlet, it seems strange to not offer it natively as part of Swidget. In other words, if you decide to buy and use any other insert, you'd immediately lose the remote access feature. Swidget has 31 days remaining on its Kickstarter campaign and has raised over $50,000. Its original funding goal was $40,000.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ring, the start-up behind the doorbell camera of the same name, has added an outdoor light/camera hybrid with multiple power options to its roster of Wi-Fi connected home security devices. The Ring Spotlight Cams will start at $199 and will be available in three versions: wired, battery-powered and solar-powered. You can preorder them in the US and Canada today, but only the wired version will ship in the next seven to 10 days; the battery- and solar-powered version won't ship until the fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "All versions of the Spotlight Cams have built-in LED light panels that turn on when they detect motion, a 1080p HD camera and two-way audio so you can hear what's going on in front of your camera and can talk to whomever's nearby. The cameras have a 140-degree field of view. The solar-powered cam comes with a Ring Solar Panel to keep the battery pack charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company said the Spotlight Cams, especially the battery and solar powered versions, will help owners add more outdoor cameras to their home security setup either or not you have the proper electrical setup. But the non-wired versions of the Spotlight Cams will cost you more: The solar option is $229, and you'll have to pay another $29 if you want an extra battery for the $199 battery-only version. However, the Spotlight Cam is still cheaper than Ring's Floodlight Cam, a similar hardwired light/camera combo that's $249.\n",
      "Leviton Decora Smart Dimmer with HomeKit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Leviton Decora DH6HD Dimmer Switch, Leviton's newest, looks and works just like a regular light switch, but it also works with Apple HomeKit, letting you control it remotely from Apple's Home app on your iPhone or by using a Siri command. At $50 (roughly converted to £38 or AU$63), it's also one of the more affordable options on the smart switch market.\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn't perfect, though. The physical controls feel stiff, and only let you change between seven dimming settings. It also doesn't offer as many features as you'll find with other competing dimmers. Unlike those competitors, the DH6HD won't work with Alexa, Google Home, IFTTT or anything else besides HomeKit. Plus, it really isn't much to look at compared with those other smart switches.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're in the market for a simple smart switch -- or just a relatively cheap option that works with HomeKit -- then the DH6HD is worth a look. Just don't expect it to look or feel any fancier than it actually is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installing a smart switch usually isn't that much more complicated than installing a regular light switch -- just flip the breaker off, connect the wires (load, line, ground and neutral in Leviton's case), screw everything into place and turn the breaker back on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our case, the Leviton switch was too big to fit inside the wall at the CNET Smart Home, so I had to install a bigger gang box in order to get it to fit. I also had a hard time finding the neutral wire, which made installation take a little longer. These kinds of issues aren't specific to Leviton, and they will vary from home to home, but Leviton at least does a decent job of walking you through the install process with the included instructions, and with helpful video tutorials online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the hardware is installed, you can use the Decora switch just like any other light switch, although it didn't make a great first impression. The button feels stiff and extra-clicky when you press it, there's a slight delay whenever you turn it on and off and the fades are a little choppy as you dim it up and down. Lighting purists especially will prefer a fancier smart switch that turns the lights on immediately, or at least one that has a smoother fade effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dimmer is by far the worst part of the physical workings of the switch. Like the main switch, it also works like a button so there's not a whole lot of fine control when you're trying to dim the light. It should be noted that there is a Leviton Smart Switch that comes without a dimmer, but still has the same HomeKit capabilities. It's a few dollars cheaper and eliminates the stiff dimmer switch altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "While other switches have multicolored light bars or touchpad interfaces, the Leviton smart switch has only the on/off button with a dimmer on the side. While some may see this as too simple for a smart switch, it actually provides a lot of advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Leviton's traditional switch design, it's easy to know right out of the box which button does what. With HomeKit support built into the Leviton switch, you also don't need any additional hardware beyond your iOS device. The switch also works in three-way setups, so you can connect more than one switch to the same light. This is a feature that the more expensive WeMo switch doesn't have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Leviton switch uses Wi-Fi to connect directly with your router, so you don't need to connect it to a hub to control it with your phone. It won't work with Android devices, though -- and it won't work with Alexa, either. Leviton does sell other Decora switches that are compatible with Android and Alexa, but at that point you may as well pay the extra money for a smart switch like the Lutron Caseta that's compatible with everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond those somewhat clunky physical controls, you can also control this light switch using the Leviton app on your phone. And, thanks to the HomeKit compatibility, you can control it using Apple's Home app for iOS devices, or by using a spoken Siri command.\n",
      "\n",
      "To connect it to HomeKit, all you have to do is enter the eight digit number at the bottom-right corner of the switch in the Home app. Syncing the switch with HomeKit also allows you to use it alongside any other HomeKit-compatible gadget under your roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "To connect it to the Leviton app, you have to scan for the device in the app until it connects. Leviton has multiple apps for its various products, which makes it hard to find the right one for this switch. Once I found and installed the correct one, the switch connected almost instantly. The app offers similar perks to HomeKit, such as controlling the dimness and turning on the light remotely, but it also allows you to control fade speed and adjust the switch's minimum or max brightness. You can also look at the specifics of each switch, such as the assigned name and the model number.\n",
      "\n",
      "In both the Home app and the Leviton app, the software dimmer is smooth and allows for far better control than when you dim the lights by hand. When compared to Belkin WeMo and Lutron Caseta, the Decora smart switch's response time to voice commands was virtually identical, and the three apps offer similar slide controls and grouping mechanisms. They're all pretty similar, at least as far as basic smartphone controls go.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a modern-looking smart switch with plenty of connected features and third-party integrations, then you'll want to skip Leviton's Decora DH6HD in favor of a more fully-featured switch from a name like Belkin or Lutron. Unlike the DH6HD, both of those competitors will work with Alexa, as will the HS200 smart switch from TP-Link, which only costs $40.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some might prefer Leviton's simplicity, as well as the focus on Apple HomeKit. The easy-to-use design and responsive app make up for the plain look and clunky physical controls. Connecting the switch to your phone and using the app is useful and intuitive, but the lack of compatibility with any other service outside of HomeKit puts some of that usefulness into question. As a baseline smart switch for HomeKit households, it does the job, but at $50, it'd be nice if it did a little more.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartest smart home would automatically inuit your every need -- no voice commands or apps required. Simply walking into a room would prompt an immediate response from your lights, thermostat and TV, to the exact settings you wanted. With the exception of select motion-activated automations, that doesn't really exist today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Startup Intellithings promises to bridge that gap with RoomMe. RoomMe is a disk-shaped presence sensor that looks just like a smoke detector. Units are currently available via crowdfunding site Indiegogo starting at $139 (that's about £105 and AU$180, converted).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the gist:\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Install one RoomMe sensor per room on the ceiling near the doorway. Two D batteries power one RoomMe (no wires needed); Intellithings says they should last up to three years before needing to be replaced.\n",
      "\n",
      "This immediately gave me pause, because, like the Lucis Nubryte camera-light control combo device, who wants to install something like this in every room?\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Download the RoomMe app for Android or iPhone and tell it what smart devices you have, as well as what room they're in.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where you can set preferences, such as, \"When I walk into my bedroom at 11 p.m. dim my Lifx bulbs to 40 percent and adjust my Nest thermostat to 68 degrees.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: As long as you have your phone in tow, the RoomMe sensor will let the app know what room you're in via presence detection -- and adjust your smart devices based on your preferences via Bluetooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I imagine RoomMe would work best for automations you tend to do habitually. If your schedule is always varied, this sort of setup would probably be more annoying than helpful. You should be able to prioritize whose settings RoomMe chooses and sticks with, though, even if multiple people with their own configurations are present. And if you walk into your bedroom at 11 a.m. Intellithings says it will react differently than it would at 11 p.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intellithings' Indiegogo page lists a wide range of smart home partners for RoomMe, including Apple HomeKit, Samsung SmartThings, Wink, Belkin WeMo and Nest. Units are expected to ship to backers everywhere in May 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm equal parts skeptical about this product and intrigued by the idea of not having to use voice commands or apps to actively control smart products. If it works, RoomMe could be really useful, particularly as assistive technology for individuals with disabilities. We'll just have to wait and see.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The summer months are tough on air conditioners. Not only is your thermostat's set temperature likely lower because of the blistering heat, your outside AC unit has to use more energy to cool that warmer-than-average ambient air to that lower-than-average indoor temperature. As a result, you end up paying significantly more on your electric bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mistbox wants to make the warmest months of the year a bit more bearable with version 2.0 of its energy-saving smart device. Mistbox 2.0 is designed to reduce the air temperature around your AC unit by gently spraying water whenever its built-in sensors and the weather forecast tell it to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Available for preorder now on Kickstarter, the second-gen Mistbox offers some key upgrades over its predecessor. It still connects to your outside AC unit, and you'll find similar sprinkler attachments that mist water from your garden hose, but the Mistbox 2.0 now operates via wind power rather than solar energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, it comes with a small wind turbine attachment that relies on exhaust air from the unit's condenser fan for power. This is a smart update because you can depend on the fan's exhaust rather than worrying whether your Mistbox is getting enough sunlight. (Outside AC units consist of a compressor, a condenser and a secondary fan.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The new Mistbox also uses cellular data instead of Wi-Fi. Partly because of this, Mistbox has changed its payment system to a subscription service. I'm not a fan of monthly subscription fees, but a cellular network makes sense in this case. I installed and began testing the original Mistbox unit at my house more than a year ago, only to run into a series of errors during the Wi-Fi configuration stage. I'm guessing my router just wasn't close enough to the spot where my outside AC unit is located.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mistbox says it's done more to treat the water that's sprayed around your AC unit with the second version of the gadget. Apparently, untreated water can damage your cooling system with harmful bacteria and other allergens.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to these major changes, Mistbox 2.0's design looks a lot better at a glance. That might not matter much, since it's going to be installed outside on your AC unit, but it could also translate to improved ease of use. We'll just have to see for ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mistbox has raised over $180,000 so far on Kickstarter; its original funding goal was just $10,000. Units are expected to ship internationally in August starting at $89 for a prepaid year-long subscription (that converts to about £70 or AU$115) -- or for $399 to purchase it outright (plus a $49 subscription fee; $349 converts to £270 or AU$455).\n",
      "\n",
      "After the crowdfunding campaign ends, Mistbox devices will be available for purchase starting at $10 per month. Non-Kickstarter customers can also opt for a $99 prepaid annual subscription. A $39 activation fee will apply to all purchases as well, unless you preorder via Kickstarter.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Comcast's Xfinity Home Secure service changed how I think about smart home devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "That might seem odd, that something primarily billed as a home security service would change an opinion on home automation tech, but to be honest, up until I signed on to do this review I didn't care much about adding connected gear to my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "My plain ol' dumb lights and thermostats worked just fine after all, and the thought of opening different apps to control different systems seemed like an unnecessary hassle. For home security, my needs were being met, for the most part, by the SimpliSafe system I'd installed. What Xfinity Home showed me, however, was how smart home devices make much more sense when fully integrated with the sensors and cameras of a home security system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xfinity's offerings aren't vastly different from what you'll find from other providers like AT&T and ADT or even do-it-yourself options like Frontpoint and Protect America. One big difference is that you can combine Comcast's devices for security and home automation with any of its growing list of supported third-party devices -- with no extra charges for using them -- and control them with the Xfinity Home mobile app, web portal or even your TV if you have Xfinity TV and an X1 DVR.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to be clear, I was already an Xfinity Internet and TV subscriber, but you don't need to be either to use Xfinity Home. You do need high-speed internet access, but it doesn't need to be Xfinity. Also, while I normally use my own Arris/Motorola modem and Netgear wireless router, for this review I used Comcast's gateway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike its competitors, Comcast doesn't have tiers of service for Home Secure. You sign up for a 24-month contract priced at $39.99 a month. At the time of this review, Comcast was offering new subscribers service for $24.99 per month for 24 months with free installation, after which it would increase to $39.99.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price includes professional 24/7 security monitoring with direct access to call for police, firefighters or an ambulance and a little hardware to get you started: three door/window sensors, a motion sensor, a touchscreen controller and a wireless keypad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sensors are completely wireless, but should your web connection go down or you lose power, it has 3G wireless and a battery backup. If you have a previously installed alarm system (I had wired motion sensors still in place from an old ADT system, for example), Xfinity can potentially take over those sensors and use them for your new setup to save you some money.\n",
      "\n",
      "The starter set might be enough for an apartment or a townhouse, but for anything larger you should expect to buy more sensors, which can drive up costs quickly. And if you want cameras for live video monitoring, those cost extra, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of this review Comcast's indoor/outdoor cameras were priced at $99 each, but to get that price requires an additional $9.99 per month, per-camera service fee for 24/7 video recording with 10 days of storage. This will also let you cut clips to download and share. Otherwise, you can pay $200 for each camera, which gets you live round-the-clock monitoring and the ability to capture clips and photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the security sensors and camera, Comcast has its own Zen thermostat and an outlet controller for lights or small appliances you want to remotely control. I didn't test the latter, but the thermostat was easy to install, works well and looks good to boot (though it did occasionally tell me it was -558 degrees Fahrenheit in my house and require a quick reboot to fix). It'll even recommend heating/cooling schedules based on your local weather patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already have a Nest thermostat or Lutron outlet dimmers? Then there's no need to buy Comcast's gear. This again is Xfinity Home's edge: It works with a large and growing list of third-party devices that you can control and automate from one interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Linking devices to the Xfinity Home service takes little more than adding your account logins for your individual smart devices into the Xfinity Home mobile app. Once they're synced, you can use the app to set up rules for home automation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the app you can set up actions like having a porch light come on at sunset and turn off at sunrise. Or have a camera capture a video clip when a door is opened or motion is detected. At the moment, though, most actions are for lighting, motion and door/window sensors, the cameras and Nest thermostats.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, while you're able to easily program a timed temperature schedule through the app, you can also create a rule that will automatically adjust the temperature to an Away mode and also shut off all your lights to save energy -- all with a single tap. You can also easily have connected lights turn on and off around your home to give the appearance of activity while you're away.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you have a Chamberlain MyQ remote garage door opener connected, you can use the app to open and close your garage and set it to send push notifications when those happen. But that's it. Well, for now anyway. Comcast promises more rules are on the way and even in the three months that I tested the service, new rules and support for new products have come onboard. That said, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't create automations similar to those available with AT&T's Digital Life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Xfinity Home app is well laid out and easy to navigate and is likely the main way you'll control your system, but certainly not the only way. The included wireless keypad lets you arm and disarm your system and send an alarm to local authorities, while the touchscreen control center (not wireless) lets you do those things as well as adjust your thermostat, check the activity and status of all the sensors in your home, view live video from your cameras and even check the weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also a web portal, which pretty much duplicates what you can do with app -- from monitoring your cameras to setting up rules to arming/disarming your system. Lastly, for Xfinity TV subscribers with an X1 DVR, you can view and control your setup through your TV using voice commands. Saying \"Xfinity Home cameras\" will bring up the live views from your cameras, for instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is missing is support for digital assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. So if being able to say, disarm your system by talking to your Amazon Echo is a must-have feature, you'll have to go elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said at the start, Xfinity Home has me rethinking the value of smart home devices. Putting them and professional security under one service makes having both more valuable. Although what it can do right now might not compare to what others offer and startup costs can get pricey, Comcast's monthly costs are competitive. Plus, with growing support for third-party devices that you can integrate now or later, Xfinity Home makes it easier to build out the system you need.\n",
      "Ring Video Doorbell 2\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring's Video Doorbell 2 isn't my all-time favorite smart buzzer -- that'd be the SkyBell HD (mainly because it offers free cloud storage of your recorded video; every one else charges for that). But you have to hardwire SkyBell for it to work; the Ring 2 runs on wires or a rechargeable lithium ion battery. The ability to install this doorbell pretty much anywhere, no wires needed, is a huge selling point. Bonus: Unlike Ring's original battery-powered buzzer, you don't have to remove the entire Video Doorbell 2 when it's time to charge -- just take out the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "It performs well, too. Expect prompt alerts whenever a visitor rings the doorbell, or if its built-in motion sensor detects nearby activity. Ring's partnerships with Amazon's Alexa, IFTTT and Wink also don't hurt. If you want a battery-powered smart doorbell, the Ring 2 is the right answer. Otherwise, take a look at SkyBell, the August Doorbell Cam or Ring's Video Doorbell Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check out the chart below for details on how the Video Doorbell 2 compares to other smart buzzers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every smart doorbell I've tested has at least one unique feature. For the Video Doorbell 2, it's the removable, rechargeable battery. For Ring's Video Doorbell Pro, it's the narrow doorframe-friendly design. The SkyBell HD offers free cloud storage -- and August's Doorbell Cam integrates seamlessly with other August products, like its HomeKit-enabled Smart Lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I wish Ring offered some sort of entry-level free cloud video storage option, I really like that every Video Doorbell 2 purchase comes with easy-to-remove face plates in different color finishes: satin nickel and venetian. Its smart home partnerships with Amazon Alexa via the Echo Show, IFTTT and Wink also add appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Say, \"Alexa, show me the front door\" to pull up a live video feed on the Amazon Echo Show's screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "IFTTT is a free web- and app-based service that lets you connect your Ring Video Doorbell 2 to other smart home devices, like Philips Hue LEDs so that \"If someone rings your doorbell, then your Philips Hue bulbs will flash.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wink helps to consolidate your connected home devices to one hub and one app. Pair the Video Doorbell 2 to Wink so you can view your live feed alongside other smart products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring makes the Video Doorbell 2's configuration extremely simple. Download the Ring app on your Android or iOS device, create an account (if you don't already have one from an existing Ring product), and follow the instructions to set up your smart doorbell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: You can either hardwire the Video Doorbell 2 or rely on the included battery for power. You'll still have to install the battery even if you opt for hardwiring, but you won't have to mess with electrical wiring at all if you only use the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always consult a professional if you have installation questions, particularly if you're replacing a hardwired buzzer with your new Ring. This process took me roughly 15 minutes from start to finish, though. It helped that I was able to use existing holes from previous installations to mount the doorbell's base plate. A battery-powered installation should take even less time, assuming you also don't have to break out the power drill to create new mounting holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the doorbell's installed, the app will prompt you to name your doorbell -- the CNET Smart Home review unit is called \"Front Door.\" Connect to the Video Doorbell 2's Wi-Fi module and then enter the credentials for your local Wi-Fi network. This process is standard for many of the Wi-Fi home security devices we test, but Ring makes it especially easy with little pop-up alerts that let you know you're on the right track.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, a notification will appear on your phone to let you know you've connected to Ring's Wi-Fi module and that you can now return to the app (see the screenshot to the right).\n",
      "\n",
      "Once your Ring Video Doorbell 2 is installed and configured, you can start using it right away. Pull up the live feed whenever you want, or when the app sends you an activity alert. From there, you can even talk to visitors via the buzzer's built-in microphone and speaker. The app also allows for scheduling and motion zones so you can customize how and when you receive these alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Performance will vary based on the quality of your Wi-Fi network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, this model worked quite well for me, delivering prompt alerts and (mostly) crisp live video feeds. The free 30-day trial of Ring's cloud service also gave me a chance to review and download saved clips to my phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Video Doorbell 2's main value is definitely its removable, rechargeable lithium ion battery. If battery power isn't a priority, you should consider other buzzers, particularly the fee-free hardwired SkyBell HD.\n",
      "Nest Cam IQ Indoor Security Camera\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The $299/£299 Nest Cam IQ is unquestionably smart, but I can't recommend it as readily as Nest's other security cameras. My main reason? Price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the $199/£159 Nest Cam Indoor and Outdoor, the indoor-only IQ has 1080p HD livestreaming, a 130-degree field of view and advanced motion-sensing smarts. It also relies on the same Nest app and works with the same smart home partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IQ's key differences are improved two-way audio and a larger 8-megapixel, 4K image sensor. The 4K sensor allows for 12x digital zoom and a free, IQ-exclusive feature called Supersight that focuses in on faces for an up-close look at who's in your house.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the IQ has more advanced specs and features than any Nest cam to date, I'm not sold on its value. If you don't mind paying more for this specced-out camera, go for it -- you will see a little more detail in the live feed. Regular ol' 1080p (without a 4K sensor) will likely do the trick for most, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow these steps to get your Nest Cam up and running:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these steps are optional, but enabling them all gives you full access to your Nest Cam's features. Providing your address, for instance, allows the software to track whether you and the rest of your family are home or away. This initial configuration process should take only a couple of minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you're in your Nest app, but your camera hasn't been connected just yet. Here are the next steps for getting your Nest Cam IQ connected to your local Wi-Fi network:\n",
      "\n",
      "This may seem like a lot of steps, but most of them are very straightforward. The whole process should take less than 10 minutes, assuming your Wi-Fi network is strong and connects easily. Note: Always confirm the strength of your Wi-Fi connection where you plan to install your camera; a sluggish network can inhibit the live feed and other important features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Create an account -- download the Nest app for Android, iPhone or the webEnable notifications -- opt-in for real-time alerts when motion activity takes placeName your house -- give your house a name; ours is the CNET Smart HomeEnter your address -- provide the address where your IQ is installed Allow Home/Away Assist -- give the Nest app permission to use your phone's locationSign up for Family Accounts -- create individual Nest accounts for every family member\n",
      "\n",
      "Select \"Add\" on the app's home screen Click \"OK\" when the app asks to access your cameraScan the QR code on the bottom of the camera from the Nest appTell the Nest app where you're installing your IQ -- our CNET Smart Home camera is in the living roomPlug in the camera with the included power adapter; the app will automatically begin searching for the cameraSelect your Wi-Fi network from the provided list and enter your password; your camera is now onlineOpt-in to Nest's Familiar Face Alerts feature (optional, and only available for Nest Aware subscribers)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that your Nest Cam IQ is online, you can go straight to viewing the live feed and enjoying free 30-day access to Nest's cloud subscription service, Nest Aware. Nest Aware is a contract-free service that costs $10 per month for 10 days of continuous video storage or $30 per month for 30 days of continuous video storage. (It's £8 or £24 in the UK respectively.) Learn more about Nest Aware here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nest Cam Indoor and Outdoor customers have to pay for Nest Aware to get access to features like Person Alerts, a type of notification that tells you when it sees a person (but not who it sees). Nest Cam IQ customers get this feature for free, as well as the IQ-exclusive Supersight. Supersight harnesses the IQ's powerful 4K image sensor, 12x digital zoom, as well as HDR (high dynamic range, for improved picture clarity) to track faces around a room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Person Alerts and Supersight worked quite well, letting me know it spotted someone and zooming in on their face so I could ID them. If these two features are particularly important to you, the Nest Cam IQ's value improves slightly (since you don't have to pay for Nest Aware to access them). But, you'd still have to pay for Nest Aware if you want to review saved video footage. Note: Nest now offers all Nest customers 3 free hours of event history, but saved as snapshots of activity, rather than video clips.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, like Nest's other cameras, the IQ works with IFTTT, Nest's own Works with Nest platform, and Amazon Alexa (soon). Check out my post on viewing security camera feeds from the Amazon Echo Show for more details on the Alexa integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these features worked well during my testing, but three improvements stood out the most. First, you can see more detail than ever before with the IQ's 4K image sensor, including facial features that were previously fuzzy. Enabling Supersight, also called \"Close-up tracking view\" in the Nest app's settings, allows the camera to zoom in on motion to capture a close-up view of a person's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-way talk is easier now, too, thanks to Nest's speaker upgrade; carry on a conversation with a family member remotely -- or tell your puppy to stop chewing on your shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest upgrade, though, is Nest's new Familiar Face Alerts feature. Note: Familiar Face Alerts are only available on IQ cameras with a Nest Aware subscription.\n",
      "\n",
      "Familiar Face Alerts help you distinguish between friends and family -- and everyone else -- through an image database. When it detects a face, you can say whether or not you recognize the person to help train the system and improve its detection capabilities over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $299/£299 Nest Cam IQ is a solid camera with an equally solid app interface for accessing the live feed and making adjustments to features. But at 100 bucks more than Nest's indoor and outdoor cameras, the IQ strikes me as prohibitively expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's especially true when you take a closer look at the features it adds. Yes, your live feed will have a bit more clarity, and you'll have free access to Person Alerts and Supersight. But are these features necessary for the regular DIYer who wants some security benefits, but is mainly checking in to see what their dog gets up to during the day? Probably not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nest Cam IQ has potential, but it just isn't quite worth the cost for most buyers today. Bump the price down, though, and Nest might really have something.\n",
      "Halo Smart Labs Halo+ Smart Smoke & CO Alarm with Weather Alerts\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By adding weather alerts to a smart smoke protector, the Halo+ skirts a fine line between useful innovation and annoying add-on. Fortunately, the first product from startup Halo Smart Labs implements the feature well enough to land on the good side of that line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $130 Halo+ Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Weather Alerts does all of the basics you'd expect of a smart smoke detector, and it thankfully adds weather alerts with enough customization that they're more helpful than bothersome. The $100 Nest Protect is still the best smart smoke detector out there, but the Halo+ is a worthy competitor that I'd recommend if you live in an area with dangerous weather -- especially if you like turning your phone off at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might be wondering why on earth you'd need your smoke alarm to tell you that it's raining out, especially since you have a smartphone and a pair of eyes. Rest assured, the alarm won't start blaring at full volume every time it sprinkles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Install the alarm -- it's hardwired with a battery backup -- and you'll use the iOS or Android app to connect it to your Wi-Fi. During setup, you'll choose which weather events you want to be notified of, and you can make changes in the future as you see fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciated the level of detail in the setup, as you can even decide that you don't care about a tornado watch, but if it gets to be a tornado warning, then you'd like to know. Check out the picture above for all of your options.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the weather does get dangerous, the alarm still won't start blaring. Instead, Halo+ tells you what's going on with a voice alert and tunes to the local weather station of your choice. I like the feature as a natural extension of the smoke detector as a safety device. Yes, it's somewhat redundant with the emergency notifications on your smartphone, but with Halo+ you can rest easy if you want to turn your phone off at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you just want a smart smoke detector without weather alerts, you can buy the Halo Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm (without the plus and thus without the weather feature) for $100. Both the Halo and the $130 Halo+ are available on the company's site, as well as Home Depot, and Lowe's. Both products are US-only for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to giving you an audible warning in the event of a hurricane or a flood, the Halo+ is certified as both a smoke and carbon monoxide detector (specifically, it conforms to UL standards 217 and 2034).\n",
      "\n",
      "Halo uses both an ionization detector and a photoelectric sensor to detect smoke. Head here for a detailed breakdown of how those two sensors work. In brief, Halo combines a quick trigger alarm with a slower, smarter alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Halo+ combines the two to good effect -- it reliably picked up smoke quickly in our tests. We used smoke candles and an ordinary First Alert hardwired alarm for comparison. The First Alert detector sounded its alarm first every time, but the Halo+ was never more than a couple of seconds behind. That test lined up with our results from the Nest Protect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Halo+ even delivered its push notifications slightly faster than the Nest Protect did. The exact speed of the alerts will depend on your internet connection, but during our testing, Halo+ delivered it's alerts immediately after the alarm itself started to sound. The Nest Protect took a couple of extra seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "In both its push alerts and its audible warnings, Halo differentiates between a little smoke and a lot of smoke. As with weather notifications, the Halo+ will tell you what's wrong with a voice notification and tell you the location of the sounding alarm as well. We assigned ours to the basement, so the alarm told us it smelled smoke in the basement, then started the traditional smoke alarm siren.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the alarm sounds, the built-in accent light flashes as well -- amber in the case of a little smoke, red for a lot of smoke or carbon monoxide, and blue in the case of a weather event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the app, you can silence the alarm, but the Halo+ has a safeguard built-in stopping you from doing this if it detects a lot of smoke. You also have to be in sight of the alarm to silence it, as the alarm's light changes color three times, and the app asks you to identify each new color before it'll shut up. In practice, I'd like to be able to silence the alarm a little more quickly, but I appreciate the caution Halo takes with the feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of an emergency, you can use the app to test the detector, check the battery, and see a log of recent alarm activity. You can also change the color and brightness of the accent light. The light offers a couple of timers so you can set it to turn off after 15 or 30 minutes, and it has effects called \"Party Mode\" and \"Rainbow\" which change its color quickly or slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly doubt Halo's Party Mode will get much use beyond showing it off as a novelty when you first buy it. I'd much rather have Nest Protect's feature where the light turns on when you pass under it at night. Aside from those unnecessary but harmless extras, I liked the accent light and found the app easy to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nest Protect gains a significant edge over the Halo+ if you want to include it as part of a larger smart home setup. First and foremost, the Protect works with other Nest products like the Nest Cam so you can automatically record the action when the alarm sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Protect also works with online rule-maker IFTTT, allowing you to set up recipes tying the Protect to a wide range of smart home products. For example, you can flash your smart lights in an emergency. Beyond that, the Protect has a host of other integrations, thanks to Nest's widespread smart-home platform called Works with Nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, Halo didn't come to the smart home empty handed. You can test your alarm or change the color of the accent light with your voice by way of Amazon's digital assistant Alexa (unfortunately, you can't silence the alarm with a voice command). Activate the Alexa skill, and you can control your Halo+ with a voice command to Amazon's always-listening speaker, the Amazon Echo.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also connect Halo to larger smart-home setups with IFTTT, SmartThings and Lowe's Iris. Similar to the Protect's connection with IFTTT, you can set up rules with SmartThings, Iris or IFTTT to flash compatible bulbs when your alarm sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted, the most unique feature of the $130 Halo+ is a redundant one with any ordinary smartphone, but if you live in an area that's prone to inclement weather, I'd still call the weather alerts handy. Plus, the feature is well implemented and the Halo+ otherwise gets the basics right. Go with the Nest Protect if you're just interested in smart smoke detection, but if you want your smoke alarm to help you keep an eye on the sky, the Halo+ is worth your consideration.\n",
      "Amazon Echo Show\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Editor's note (October 26, 2017): Since introducing the Show in June 2017, Amazon has evolved its lineup of Echo smart speakers, refreshing some older models and continuing to expand Alexa's skills, support new third-party integrations and release special features like free domestic calling. Though the competition has stiffened, neither the Google Home Max nor the forthcoming Apple HomePod have a display, leaving this experimental ground wholly to Amazon -- for now. In fact, Amazon's own Echo Spot is the Show's closest competitor, combining elements of the Dot with the Show's visual capabilities. It's due out in December 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original Amazon Echo Show review, originally published in June 2017, follows below.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alexa, what can you show me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the first thing I asked the touchscreen-equipped Amazon Echo Show, the online retail giant's newest and, at $230 or £200, most expensive Alexa gadget. \"There's a lot,\" Alexa exclaimed, inasmuch as a mostly monotone AI assistant can exclaim anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "She can show movie trailers, she went on to tell me. She can show the weather, or the items on a to-do list. She can show the lyrics as she streams music. She can show your options as you shop for stuff on Amazon. She can show YouTube videos and movies from Amazon Prime Video. She can show you pictures of your loved ones, or connect you with them directly via video chat. All you have to do is ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that comes in addition to Alexa's existing capabilities for things like voice-activated alarms, timers, traffic, fact checking, bad jokes and smart home controls, not to mention the thousands of third-party \"skills\" that each let her do something new once you enable them. She's always been a likable over-achiever, and the Echo Show doesn't change that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how much does the Echo Show build upon it? If you're already happy with Skype or FaceTime, then video chat alone might not be enough. Third party skills might help, as they certainly did with the original Echo smart speaker, but Amazon needs to lead the charge -- and in a lot of cases during my time with the Echo Show, the touchscreen didn't add anything to the Alexa experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Echo Show has an awful lot of potential, and with slightly better sound than the touchscreen-free Echo, it assumes its place as the fanciest Alexa gadget yet. Still, its ultimate success will largely depend on what outside developers -- and Amazon itself -- choose to do with it as the software library matures. In other words, there's room for the Echo Show to grow, but unless you're dying to try those voice-activated video calls, waiting for Amazon to show us more before buying in seems like the best bet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big, central question with the Echo Show is whether or not the new touchscreen really adds anything to the Alexa experience. The answer depends on how you plan to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the biggest draw is hands-free, voice-activated video calls with other Alexa users. To opt in, you'll register your phone number with your Amazon account in the Alexa app. Alexa will then scan the contacts in your phone, and if she sees any contacts with numbers from Amazon's database, she'll add them to the list of people you can ask her to call or message. If that contact has an Echo Show, or if they're answering using the Alexa app on their phone, you can video chat with them, FaceTime-style.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, you can block unwanted callers, a feature Amazon foolishly forgot about when it first introduced calls and messages for the Echo and Echo Dot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end result is essentially a private home phone server populated only with people you want to talk to -- no telemarketers, survey takers or bill collectors. It's not a proper phone, so you can't use your Echo Show to call the police or the dry cleaner across town, but it's still an interesting idea at a time when fewer and fewer people are using landlines. This is especially true for fans of FaceTime who enjoy video chatting with friends and family -- I'll bet they'd enjoy the Echo Show's hands-free approach quite a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of those FaceTime fans are probably parents and grandparents, and if you've watched any of the Echo Show's promo ads, then you know that Amazon is targeting that demographic pretty aggressively. Sure enough, with its large-sized font and gentle suggestions for Alexa commands on nearly every screen, the Echo Show is Amazon's most senior-friendly Alexa gadget yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "That brings us right to Alexa's new \"Drop In\" feature. Enable it, and you'll be able to authorize specific contacts to peep in on your camera feed regardless of whether or not you actually pick up the call. When they do, they'll see a blurred feed for the first 10 seconds, during which you have the option of disabling the camera or rejecting the call outright. You'll also see a notification on screen whenever someone is actively viewing your feed. The feature pairs with a motion sensor in the Echo Show itself that -- again, when authorized -- lets your contacts know when it senses you nearby. Seems a bit creepy, but it also sounds like a pretty sensible way of keeping an eye on an aging relative.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, targeting older users with a camera-centric feature might make more sense than you'd expect. A recent SafeHome survey on tech-related privacy concerns found that respondents aged 65 and up were less bothered by security cameras than any other category polled, including fitness trackers, TV sets and even antivirus software.\n",
      "\n",
      "On that front, another of the Echo Show's big draws is support for smart home video cameras that let you check out your camera's feed on the screen with a simple Alexa command.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tested this out in the CNET Smart Home by enabling the Nest Cam skill in the Alexa app, then asking Alexa to show me the video feed from the CNET Smart Apartment 20 miles across town. It worked perfectly, and makes for a pretty compelling feature if you're security-minded, or if you just want to use the Echo Show as a voice-activated baby monitor. Along with Nest, cameras from big names like Ring, August, Logitech and Netgear Arlo are already supported, and more are certain to follow suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other use cases for that touchscreen are more niche, and less compelling as a result. You can see your options when you ask Alexa to add something to your Amazon shopping cart -- but voice shopping has never been Alexa's most interesting skill, no matter how much Amazon wants it to be. You can see the details of your local forecast when you ask Alexa for a weather update -- but seeing a forecast on a screen just duplicates a feature we already have on our phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Video playback on the Echo Show feels a little superfluous, too. Sure, I can imagine scenarios where voice-activated YouTube access makes sense -- say, in the kitchen, where you might want to pull up a recipe video while you're busy chopping onions. For the most part, though, I think a phone or a tablet would suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the touchscreen's limitations seem to stem from uninspired design on Amazon's part. Some of that design feels downright lazy. For instance, when I told Alexa to \"show me pictures of cats,\" she showed me just a single picture of a cat. When I told her to \"show me more,\" she replied, \"I'm not quite sure how to help with that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The bigger issue to me is that the Echo Show could have been an opportunity for Amazon to flesh out Alexa's personality with clever, stylized visuals accompanying her spoken responses. Instead, we get a bland, barebones display that doesn't do much of anything to bring Alexa to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take smart home control. Like with other Alexa products, you can ask the Echo Show to dim compatible smart lights up and down. When I asked her to set the lights in the CNET Smart Home kitchen to 70 percent, she was happy to oblige -- but the screen didn't change at all. I was expecting to see an animation of a light bulb illuminating, or perhaps a slider on screen dialing up to 70 that I could then touch to make an additional adjustment up or down. Nope, nothing of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexa's kid-friendly collection of terrible jokes is another missed opportunity for the display. She'll still gladly tell you a corny joke, but when she does, the screen won't display anything but the text of her response. Call up an easter egg from her long list of easter egg responses (i.e. \"Alexa, may the force be with you\"), and she'll add in some monochromatic, nonanimated clipart of fireworks above the text. Yawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps Amazon is just being cautious here and waiting to see which touchscreen-optimized Alexa skills really click with customers before committing to a stylistic direction. The problem? Aside from the smart home camera feeds, only a handful of the more-than-10,000 Alexa skills will actually put the touchscreen to use at the time of Echo Show's launch. Here's all of them:\n",
      "\n",
      "That list is likely to grow pretty fast, especially for touchscreen-familiar services with existing Alexa skills -- they've already got the voice control part of development done and out of the way. On the other hand, I polled my smart home contacts from Alexa-friendly companies like Philips, Lifx, Lutron, Wink and more -- none of them would confirm that they had a touchscreen-optimized Alexa skill in development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon could have primed the pump here by developing a couple of showy new touchscreen skills of its own. For my money, the most obvious would have been a karaoke skill that takes advantage of Alexa's new ability to display lyrics as you stream music. Amazon designed no such skill, however, and while I'm certain that some third-party developer ultimately will, it's still another missed opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the product itself, the Echo Show sheds the curves and cylindrical designs of the Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Look camera in favor an angular, blockier build. If you ignore the three buttons up top (volume up, volume down and a mute button that turns Alexa off), it looks a little like a mini rear-projection TV for your kitchen counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reactions to the design were mixed when I polled my colleagues. Some appreciated the sturdy, simple build, but others, including myself, found it to be a bit dated-looking. The 7-inch screen is big enough for the job at hand (and slightly bigger than the screen on an iPhone 7 Plus), but the double bezel around the edges and the bulky body surrounding it both make it feel smaller than it actually is.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest complaint with the design is that you can't adjust the angle of the touchscreen or the camera, which is less than ideal for what's essentially a modern-day video phone. Even something simple, like the adjustable feet you'll find on the bottom of a keyboard would have been nice here -- instead, you're stuck squeezing something underneath to prop it forward or backwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound quality, on the other hand, was surprisingly strong -- and, to my ear, noticeably better than the Amazon Echo, which has a habit of distorting bass just a bit at high volumes. By comparison, the Echo Show puts out clean, rich bass, thanks in no small part to the pair of Dolby speakers hidden inside. My colleague David Carnoy agreed that the Echo Show is a sonic step forward for Amazon -- though he also pointed out that those Dolby speakers are too close together to provide meaningful stereo sound unless you're unrealistically close to the device. At any rate, it certainly sounds good enough for casual listening, or, heck, even a small-sized house party.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPod and the iPhone showed us how an audiocentric gadget can evolve into something exponentially more significant -- and perhaps Amazon is trying to bottle some of that same lightning with the Echo Show. But, new video call functionality aside, the surprisingly uninspired touchscreen feels less like an evolution than a lateral move. For all of the things Alexa showed me, I wish I had seen more of a vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not to say that Amazon's $230/£200 touchscreen speaker isn't an intriguing device. Far from a swing and a miss, it might just be a hit, if early indications of strong preorder sales are accurate. But unless you think you'd put that video calling feature to regular use, I think it's worth waiting to see what else Amazon and its army of outside developers can show us before you buy in.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The smart button is one of the simplest ways to personalize how you control your home. Essentially, you can connect a simple Bluetooth-enabled button to any gadget around the house. Then whenever you want to turn on the lights, skip to the next song on your sound system, or even send a text message, you can press a button to issue the command.\n",
      "\n",
      "While that might seem unnecessary, the idea is, for $25 per button, you can streamline common tasks, saving 20 or 30 seconds many times per day. The payoff comes in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with smart buttons is their Bluetooth connection: they require a nearby phone to bridge the gap between them and the Wi-Fi-connected devices they control. But Shortcut Labs, the developer behind the Flic smart button, which is one of the best Bluetooth buttons on the market, is releasing a smart hub that'll cut out the need for a phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Flic Hub will cost $100 (although Indiegogo will let early crowd-funders preorder it for $50). While it will make Flic buttons better than before, the hub's price tag feels a little high, especially for a product that depends on its identity as an affordable entry point to the connected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hub isn't the first of its type (see the Logitech Pop button), but it is a helpful supplement to the standalone Bluetooth button. The buttons will retain their IFTTT-compatibility and dozens of integrations, but the hub will also mean your phone won't have to be around to use them -- offering multiple user control. If the hub works well, and users have a number of buttons already, then it might be useful. But if you don't already own multiple Flic buttons, then you probably shouldn't spend $100 on the hub.\n",
      "Amazon Dash Wand with Alexa\n",
      "                                    2017\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon's newest gadget is a battery-powered, voice-enabled grocery scanner called the Dash Wand. Point it at a barcode and press the button to add that item to your Amazon shopping cart when you're running low, or press and hold to ask Alexa to add it. She'll even talk back to you through the scanner's tiny speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Amazon Dash Wand arrives just as the megaretailer is completing its $13.7 billion-dollar acquisition of Whole Foods, so it's clear that Amazon sees huge potential in disrupting people's grocery habits and making it as easy as possible to buy everything online.\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, the Dash Wand is a success -- it's easy to use, it works reliably, and it only costs $20. Add in the fact that Amazon throws in a $20 shopping credit and three months of free AmazonFresh Pickup (normally $15 per month), and the Dash Wand can pay for itself and then some. Seems fair for a gadget that's designed to get you to buy things.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I mentioned, Alexa, right? The Dash Wand can't do everything -- no music, no reminders and, perhaps most disappointing, no kitchen timers -- but it still packs an awful lot of Alexa convenience into a device that ostensibly costs nothing. You can ask for weather forecasts and corny jokes, you can ask how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon, and you can even control your smart home gadgets or try out any of the thousands of third-party Alexa skills. That alone might be enough to get a lot of people to try this thing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting started with the Dash Wand was pretty simple -- just insert the two included AAA batteries and hold the button down until it enters pairing mode. From there, you'll go to a link on your mobile device that'll sync the Dash Wand up with your Amazon account and your home's Wi-Fi network.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for storage, you can hang the Dash Wand from an included stick-up hook, or just stick it to the fridge thanks to a built-in magnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent a couple of days playing with the Dash Wand at the CNET Smart Home, and it performed pretty well. The scanner never failed to read a barcode, and if I'd ever scan something a couple of times in quick succession (say, if I wasn't certain it had worked), it'd still only add one unit to my cart. Alexa voice ordering worked well too, though you'll need to specify what brand you want in the Amazon app if you ask for something generic, like \"toilet paper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had less luck when I tried asking Alexa to add multiple things to our cart. Amazon's listing for the Dash Wand claims you should be able to do this, giving the example command, \"Strawberries. Bananas,\" but that didn't work when I tried it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, the Wand added a single item to my shopping list that asked me to specify which kind of \"strawberries bananas\" I wanted. Here's hoping Amazon tweaks that in the near future, as ideally, you should be able to read off your whole shopping list to Alexa if you so choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd also like to see Amazon let you pair this thing with another Alexa product, like the Echo or Echo Dot smart speakers. That could be a potential workaround for the fact that the Dash Wand can't stream music or set kitchen timers on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last note: with its simple design and ease of use, the Amazon Dash Wand is definitely kid-friendly -- but perhaps too much so. I can just imagine my Star Wars-obsessed nephews using it as a makeshift lightsaber or laser blaster (and perhaps scanning every barcode in my brother's place in the process).\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexa is a powerful, popular voice assistant, and it's hard to fault a device that'll get her into your kitchen as cheaply as the Dash Wand will. Easier online grocery orders aren't enough of a selling point on their own to make it a must-have, but Amazon is clearly working hard at changing that. Extending its AmazonFresh Pickup service to Whole Foods locations across the US would obviously be a good step in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, if the Dash Wand is trying to get us hooked on online grocery shopping, then Alexa's the bait. Even if you couldn't care less about Amazon's grocery games, the $20 Dash Wand still makes sense as an extra Alexa access point, or perhaps as a cheap way for newbies to take her for a test drive. If that gets more people on board with Amazon's grocery strategy, the Dash Wand will be seen as a success.\n",
      "Ring Video Doorbell Pro\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart doorbells are an entirely new breed of buzzer. Part door chime and part security camera, these hybrid devices alert you to activity whether you're home or away. Ring's $249 premium smart buzzer, the Video Doorbell Pro, is the latest model I've gotten my hands on (£195/AU$325, converted).\n",
      "\n",
      "Good stuff: The Video Doorbell Pro transmits video in crisp 1080p HD resolution and it has a slimmer design than many other connected door bells, including earlier models from Ring itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-so-good stuff: You have to pay at least $3 per month for cloud video storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring Pro is well worth consideration, but its main selling point is its small size. If you aren't installing your new doorbell on a narrow doorframe, I'd go with SkyBell's round HD Wi-Fi Video Doorbell instead. It costs 50 bucks less than the Ring Pro, comes with free cloud storage and works with more major smart home platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where most connected doorbells today measure roughly 2.5 to 3 inches wide (7.6cm), Ring's Pro clocks in at just 1.85 inches (4.7cm). That may not seem like a big difference, but it will matter a lot when it's time to replace your existing buzzer. Since non-smart doorbells are typically very small, builders often route the necessary electrical wiring to doorframes as a default.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means you have just an inch or two of horizontal space to work with before the buzzer begins to extend past the frame. Case in point: August's 2.9-inch square Doorbell Cam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring Pro's 1.85 inches might still be too wide for some spaces, but it's definitely a slimmer design than any other camera-equipped buzzer I've reviewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me that's a significant selling point. I know I wouldn't want to deal with rerouting my doorbell wiring to brick or siding; you probably won't want to, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while the Video Doorbell Pro has to be hardwired, Ring's installation process is very simple. Wire extenders are even included in the box so you can improve your connection, if needed. Always consult a professional if you have any questions about the wiring. Otherwise, this installation should take less than 30 minutes (assuming you don't have to reroute wiring or drill a lot of new holes).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring even includes all four interchangeable faceplates with your purchase so you can change the color finish easily whenever you want. The colors include satin nickel, venetian (aged bronze), satin black and pearl white.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how does Ring's Pro doorbell compare with other smart buzzers? The news is mostly good, except that it's $50 more expensive. Take a look:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pro is also quite similar to Ring's $199 Video Doorbell. It has live video streaming, the same $3 monthly minimum subscription for cloud storage and the same third-party partnerships with IFTTT and Wink. Design and resolution are the main distinguishing features; the smaller Pro has 1080p HD video and the more basic Video Doorbell has 720p HD. The existing Video Doorbell also has a rechargeable battery in case you don't want to deal with wiring -- you can hardwire it if you want to, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring's Video Doorbell Pro delivered prompt alerts and the live feed worked well in day and night vision mode (this feature kicks in automatically in low-light conditions). I like that you can set motion alert zones on the video feed in the Ring app. You can also schedule when you receive alerts. Of course, you'll need to check the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the install location before you buy. If it's spotty, the live feed and other video-dependent features won't work well (or at all).\n",
      "\n",
      "But SkyBell's HD buzzer stands out the most here. For $50 less, you get 1080p HD video, free cloud storage and integration with Amazon's voice control platform, Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring's $249 Video Doorbell Pro is definitely smart, but its main selling point is its small design. If you want a connected buzzer that's more likely to fit on a doorframe, this is the model for you. Otherwise, it doesn't offer much more than most of the $199 doorbells sold today. The SkyBell HD is particularly compelling since it costs less than Ring's Pro, but has the same 1080p resolution with the added bonus of free cloud storage and Alexa support.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Connected plugs might be the building blocks of a smart home, but they can also be really annoying with their blocky design getting in the way of other outlets. Now a new smart plug is on the market, the Cnct IntelliPlug, and it's setting the standard for the smart plug industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cnct IntelliPlug is a Wi-Fi enabled smart plug (meaning it connects directly to your phone), with an unobtrusive design, easy setup and an extremely low $20 price tag. The Cnct (pronounced \"connect\") works with the Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) line for voice control, and includes a countdown timer, scheduling functions and remote control. While it doesn't boast the rich features of pricier devices, the Cnct IntelliPlug is the best affordable plug you'll find right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the features the Cnct IntelliPlug has:\n",
      "\n",
      "The IntelliPlug doesn't have:\n",
      "\n",
      "The feature that really stands out on the IntelliPlug is the countdown timer, which a surprising number of smart plugs don't include. The timer allows a little more flexibility than simple scheduling, as you can set a function to run, say, 10 minutes from now, and to stop 30 minutes after that -- all without having to check the time of day at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wi-Fi connection (meaning no hub required)Voice control (Alexa only)Countdown timerScheduling featureRemote controlSmart charging (the plug will automatically turn off once your plugged-in phone is fully charged)\n",
      "\n",
      "HomeKit or Google Home ($129.00 at Dell Home) integrationEnergy usage trackingIFTTT integration\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the features work reliably (although the smart charging feature is really unnecessary, as most smart phones regulate overcharging themselves now).\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest features missing are the integrations -- particularly with HomeKit and IFTTT. These two integrations allow for much better cooperation between devices, which makes smart homes really smart. And right now, device cooperation isn't really possible with the IntelliPlug.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cnct IntelliPlug's claim to fame is its size, which to its credit, is much smaller than the competition -- whether you compare it with the more feature-rich $35 Belkin WeMo Mini or the more basic $25 Geeni Energi. Its tiny design doesn't entirely avoid blocking other outlets, as its rounded edges can get in the way of some oddly shaped plugs. But you'll likely blame the oddly shaped plug more than the IntelliPlug when you run into problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real size difference that matters is in price. The $20 dollar price tag (not to mention the limited-time Indiegogo packages) is the lowest we've seen so far in the industry. One use suggested on the IntelliPlug's Indiegogo page is plugging in a curling iron, so if you forgot to switch it off before leaving for work you can do it remotely. With more expensive plugs, that would seem absurd; $35 to be sure you switched off a device you may not use daily? But at $20, mundane uses like these start seeming like decent investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cnct IntelliPlug is the smallest smart plug around, and it has the smallest price tag for its respectable suite features. Sure, it won't perform the functions of pricier competitors, and it needs more integrations before becoming the best smart plug on the market across all price categories. But for now, this is certainly the best affordable smart plug money can buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cnct IntelliPlug is available for preorder on Indiegogo now, and the developer plans to ship units as early as July.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Read this description of the Amazon Echo Look out loud: A $200 photo and video camera with a smart speaker built-in that also takes selfies and doles out fashion advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does this sound silly? Then this product isn't for you, and nothing I say in these next few hundred words will convince you otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon designed the Echo Look to appeal to a specific set of folks who care about their outward appearance and want a digital fashion adviser. You use the Echo Look's camera to take hands-free, full-body selfies and videos that you store in the accompanying app. Amazon then uses a combination of artificial intelligence and advice from real stylists to help you decide between two outfits. And as crazy as it sounds, it does this job really well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Echo Look is at its best when you treat it as a fashion adviser instead of a smart-home speaker. It gives you an easy way to catalog your wardrobe and get a real-life view of how you look in your clothes. And the Style Check feature provides surprisingly good feedback about what you should wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Echo Look still has its faults. Its sound quality is poor, especially when you compare it to other Echo speakers. The app could use a few additional features to give you more proactive fashion advice. And it gives me pause to consider the amount of visual information Amazon will gobble up with this thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you consider yourself fashion-conscious, you might want to find a spot in your budget and your closet for the Echo Look. But if you just want a smart speaker without a side of fashion advice, you're better off with one of Amazon's other Alexa-powered products.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, the Echo Look is an internet-connected selfie and quick video camera that shares most of the same features as the rest of Amazon's line of Echo products (the original Echo, the Echo Dot, the Echo Tap and the upcoming Echo Show).\n",
      "\n",
      "It runs on Alexa, Amazon's voice-activated virtual assistant, and it can do almost everything other Alexa devices can. Via spoken Alexa commands, the Echo Look can stream music, check your calendar or tell you about the weather, among other tasks. And it connects to other internet-connected devices like plugs or light bulbs so you can control your smart-home with your voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of looks, the Echo Look is more like a security camera than a speaker. It's only 2.4 by 2.4 by 6.3 inches, so it doesn't take up that much space. It screws into a base that allows you to easily tilt the camera to get the best shot of you (you can also mount it to a wall).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some noticeable shortcomings when you compare the Echo Look to its sister speakers. You can't use it to send or receive messages, and it can't differentiate which speaker you're talking to if you have more than one Echo device in your home. The Echo Look's sound quality is also noticeably worse than its sister Echos because the speaker is located on the back of the unit, so it projects sound away from you rather than toward you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that scene in \"Clueless\" (the 1995 movie, not the watered-down TV show) when Alicia Silverstone's Cher was getting ready for her big lose-her-virginity date with Christian? She had some sage advice: \"I don't rely on mirrors, so I always take Polaroids.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Echo Look is the 2017 version of Cher's preferred way to preview an outfit. You place the camera on an elevated surface like the top of a dresser. Pull up the Echo Look app on your phone and use the video feed to adjust the camera so it captures a full-body view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you're satisfied with the view, you can start taking selfies. This is where Alexa comes into play. You use voice commands to activate the camera, which gives you a hands-free way to grab a selfie. Let's say you want to see how you look in a new pair of jeans and a top. Put on the outfit, use the app to see the camera's view and position yourself in the middle of the frame and say, \"Alexa, take my picture.\" The Echo Look will beep twice, then the four LED lights that surround the camera will illuminate, and the camera takes your photo on the third beep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Echo Look app (available for iOS and Android) keeps up with all your photos organized by date in the \"Looks\" section. By default, your photo appears up in the app with a slightly blurred background so you and your outfit pop (you can disable that setting). Each picture includes a \"Details\" section where you can add notes about your outfit. This section also keeps a record of what the weather was on that day to provide your future self with some context for your past outfit choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Echo Look wouldn't be an Amazon product if there wasn't some encouragement to buy some clothes through the online retailer. In the \"Details\" section of some pictures, you'll find pictures of clothing options that are similar to what you're wearing in the selfie. If you select one of the comparable outfits, the Echo Look app redirects you straight to the Amazon listing for the item. This inevitable tie-in to online shopping is fairly unobstrusive, and it isn't available with every photo. And the outfits that the Echo Look app suggests are pretty spot-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also use the Echo Look to capture 6-second videos of yourself, ideally to get a 360-degree view of your ensemble and answer the age-old question: \"How does my ass look?\" Say, \"Alexa, take my video,\" wait for the aforementioned beeps, and do a twirl. These videos are stored in the same space on the app as the still shots, with the same option to add details about your outfit. And if you really like what you see, you can download and share your photos and videos from within the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The photos and video that the Echo Look captures provide a good view of what you're wearing that indeed trumps what you get from a mirror. They're well lit thanks to the LED lights on the body of the Echo Look, and the voice activation eliminates the need for selfie sticks, self timers or a patient partner who doesn't mind taking your picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to see the Echo Look app beef up what you can do with your pictures in the app. For example, it would be helpful to be able to categorize your clothes with labels like \"dressy,\" \"business professional\" or \"casual\" so you can easily scan through your wardrobe for a specific occasion. But overall, I think \"Clueless'\" Cher would be pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest draws of the Echo Look is the app's Style Check feature. Here's how it works: You select two photos of yourself in different outfits and submit them to Style Check. In about a minute, Style Check will return a recommendation about which outfit you should wear by showing the percentage it favors each outfit.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Amazon, \"Style Check is powered by combining advanced machine learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists. Our fashion specialists have varied backgrounds in the fashion, retail, editorial and styling industries and are trained to evaluate outfits based on fit, color, styling, season and current trends.\" Style Check also asks you to choose which option you like better to help the system \"get smarter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon declined to get into a lot of detail about how the Style Check works or how it improves over time. But after a couple of days of heavy use, Style Check seems pretty smart. It knew when I attempted to submit a picture of me and a picture my colleague Megan Wollerton in the same Style Check. For the most part, it also knew when I attempted to submit two different pictures of me in the same outfit. And the camera could even tell the difference between two pictures of our intern, Kaelan Doolan, in the same clothes but different shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a handful of Style Checks, you can start coming to some conclusions about what outfits work best for you. For example, I noticed patterns in what the app recommended for me: dresses over pants and a top, slacks and a cardigan over a t-shirt and jeans, fitted clothes over looser options. But I'd like to see Style Check provide more outright advice rather than having to review all of the Style Checks to find these patterns. For example, the app could send me a push notification that recommended that I wear more skirts based on Style Check comparisons I'd submitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike a spouse or a good friend, the Echo Look isn't trying to build up your self-esteem. Rather, it provides objective advice based on the info with which you present it. And I agreed with the Style Check in nearly every comparison I submitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's address the elephant in the room: With a built-in camera that takes photos and videos, how safe is it to have the Echo Look in my bedroom?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what Amazon had to say about privacy and security with the Echo Look:\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also a slight delay between what the camera captures and what shows up on the video in the app. And you can't access the camera's feed in the app if your phone is on a different Wi-Fi network than your Echo Look.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I see some practical issues. For example, someone in your home can still snap pictures even if your phone's not on the same Wi-Fi network, so you might get flooded with a feed of silly selfies if you have some precocious kids or roommates. And at the end of the day, you're still submitting a lot of visual information to Amazon and trusting that it will be in good hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon's Echo speakers have thus far aimed squarely for mainstream appeal. The Echo Look is different. This is a product for folks who care about fashion and outward appearance -- hard stop. It provides a reliable second opinion and great visual catalog of your wardrobe. But if you just want a smart speaker, this is not the Echo you're looking for.\n",

      "Hive, like ADT, Vivint and other professional companies, locks you into a multiyear contract. In Hive's case, it's two years, or 24 months of required $25 monthly payments. (The Welcome Home Standard Plan is currently US-only; Hive is based in the UK, where a Welcome Home plan costs £5.99 per month.) There is no upfront cost for the hardware, but the total cost after two years comes to $600 for the Standard kit I tested -- and even more if you use Hive for longer than two years.\n",

      "Yes, you'd have to pay $457 or $490 up front for Wink or SmartThings, but Hive charges you $25 per month... forever. However long you use the system, you have to pay that monthly fee. And because you have to agree to a 2-year minimum contract, you're going to pay at least $600 no matter what.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the thing that gets me. Hive's system performed well. The devices were easy to pair with the app and they were similarly easy to control after the initial configuration. I really can't say the same for Wink or SmartThings.\n",

      "That's really it. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you've connected all of your Hive devices. You can control them in the app immediately, including scheduling lights to turn on or adjusting thermostat settings. Two device automations are simple to create in the Actions section of the app, such as, \"When the motion sensor detects activity, turn on the entryway light.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The system also works with Amazon Alexa speakers and the Google Home.

      "Clearly, I have mixed feelings about Hive's Welcome Home Standard automation kit. Yes, it's easy to use, but that price...? Not so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if the value was there (if it included professional monitoring, for instance), having a contract term for a do-it-yourself product really defeats the purpose of DIY. If Hive looks good to you and you don't care about the monthly charges, it's a decent option. Still, I'd suggest looking at other options before you settle on Hive.\n",
      "iHome iAVS1 Bedside Stereo Speaker System for Amazon Echo Dot\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first product iHome ever released was an iPod clock radio dock back in 2005. It was a huge hit, and iHome's been making bedside docks for popular gadgets ever since. Their latest, the iAVS1, is built to house an Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker, amplify its sound a little bit, and fully transform it into a voice-activated alarm clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "On paper, it's as much of a no-brainer as that original iPod dock. After all, plenty of people -- myself included -- already keep an Echo Dot on their nightstand and use it to wake up in the morning. Why not commit to the bit and dock that Dot in a clock, complete with better sound quality?\n",
      "\n",
      "In my case, the price tag gives me pause. This thing costs $70 ($20 more than Echo Dot costs by itself), and it really offers nothing beyond a clockface, a modest bump in sound quality and an extra USB port to charge your devices. The iAVS1 might be a tempting upgrade if you catch it on sale, but at full price, I'm not sure it's worth the splurge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with that design. Available in both white and black, the dock itself is fairly large as alarm clocks go, with an upward-facing speaker spanning its top face. iHome pitches it as a stereo speaker system, and it definitely offers fuller sound than what you'll get from an Echo Dot on its own. To my ear, though, it's a fairly modest improvement -- I wonder if the addition of forward-facing speakers on the front of the dock would have helped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the dock is a cinch. Just pop Alexa into place, then connect the short-length audio cable and an included short-length USB cable into the central USB port to keep the Dot powered. The top half-inch or so of your Dot will stick out of the device -- that's because iHome wanted to make sure that people with first-gen Echo Dots could still access the ring around the top of the speaker that controls the volume. The reason that's important? The iAVS1 doesn't have volume controls of its own, and instead relies entirely on the Echo Dot.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the iAVS1 hardly has any controls of its own. There's a button on top to adjust the brightness of the clock and a set of buttons on the bottom of the dock that you'll use to set the time, but that's it. No volume controls, no radio and no snooze button: All of it gets outsourced to Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who use an Echo Dot to wake up in the morning are already used to grumbling at Alexa to shut the alarm off as opposed to slapping a snooze button, but I still think iHome could have done more here. Simple audio controls would have been a nice start -- a button you could pair with one of iHome's smart plugs to turn a lamp on and off from across the room would have been even better. Features like that would have gone a long way to help justify the $70 price tag. Instead, they're missed opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something else worth mentioning: The microphones at the top of your Echo Dot might have a harder time hearing you during music playback because of the amplified sound coming from the dock's speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "To test this out, I took the iAVS1 into a quiet room, cranked some local Louisville rock up to 75 percent volume, then tried talking to Alexa at three distances: a foot away, a few feet away and several feet away. Up close, the Echo Dot heard me say \"Alexa\" on the first try. But from a few feet away, it took two tries. From across the room, it took three. By comparison, an Echo Dot on its own in the same test heard me on the first attempt from all three distances.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a pretty minor annoyance (most Alexa users have come to learn that raising your voice is an occasional necessity), but again, I wonder if front-facing speakers that blast music in your direction instead of straight up at the Dot's array of microphones wouldn't have been a better design choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned before, I use an Echo Dot to wake me up each morning -- but I also keep a small clock next to it for quick, groggy glances at the time while I'm in bed. A dock that essentially combines the two is a no-brainer product that I'd welcome to my nightstand if someone got it for me as a gift. But to spend $70 of my own money on it, I'd need it to offer more than just a convenient spot for my Dot and a slight uptick in sound quality, especially given that likable, fully-featured competitors like Beddi don't cost all that much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "With no additional features to speak of -- no programmable smart buttons, no playback controls, no built-in wake-up light -- that's the mark that iHome misses here. The iAVS1 is a decent enough device, but it's too basic to justify the $70 price tag. Wake me up when it's on sale, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE, 4:15 PM EST, 7/7/2017: This review originally stated that iHome's alarm clock dock required you keep the Echo Dot plugged in separately. It actually includes a short-length USB cable that plugs from the Echo Dot into the back of the clock's base to keep it powered, a fact I simply missed during testing. The text of the review has been updated accordingly, and the score has increased slightly, but the overall buying recommendation remains unchanged.\n",
      "Loop Labs Notion\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Notion tries to squeeze all the smarts you need to watch over your home into a small white puck. For $220, you get three of those pucks and a bridge that plugs into your wall and connects those sensors to the cloud. You can ask a puck to tell you if your front door is open or closed. You can stick one in the laundry room to watch for leaks or on the ceiling where it will listen for your smoke detector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of buying a bunch of different specialized sensors to do these same tasks, the Notion sensors adapt to your needs by multitasking. I love the idea of decluttering the smart home, but in practice, Notion doesn't offer any practical advantage over more specialized sensors like the $40 SmartThings Multipurpose Sensor or the $50 Roost Leak Detector. The app limits what senses you can turn on together, and some of the combinations you can enable don't make sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment, Notion doesn't work with any other smart home systems either, so if it does detect something wrong, Notion can't do anything other than send you a push notification. Because of that, Notion isn't as good at any individual task as the best specialized devices out there. I'd wait for future updates before investing in Notion, or if you know what you want to monitor, you can take your pick from a crowded field of specialized sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tested the $220 three pack of Notion sensors with a bridge. The $300 package might be the best deal -- you get five sensors with a bridge. Individually, you can buy an additional bridge for $80 and an additional sensor for $50. Head to the company's site to make a purchase. Notion's only available in the US and Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The site also talks about the eight senses of Notion -- temperature, acceleration, natural frequency, light, motion, sound, angular rate and water. In the future, Notion could use all of these senses to their full potential and sense the light levels in your home. It could tell you when your propane tank is almost empty. It could even listen for the doorbell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, those eight senses boil down to four basic options. You can use Notion to monitor when a door opens and closes (including a garage door), Notion will sense temperature, it'll watch for leaks, and it'll listen for smoke or CO alarms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setup's pleasingly simple. You need at least one sensor and the bridge to get started. Plug the bridge into any outlet, and you'll see the light at the top start flashing. Create an account via the app, then you'll scan the QR code on the back of each sensor to add them to your account. Each bridge can accommodate up to 15 sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a big house, you might need more than one bridge so all of your sensors are in range -- the bridge had trouble picking up a sensor when I moved it down one floor and over a couple of rooms. Thankfully, you can position the bridge so it doesn't block the adjacent outlet. Get the bridge and the sensors synced, and you can start placing the latter where you need monitoring via the sticky adhesive on the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used my first sensor to monitor the door of the CNET Smart Home. The app asks you to place the sensor above the knob at the top of the door. I wanted this first sensor to multitask as much as it could, so I used the app to try to enable Notion's other senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app stopped me from using it to listen to smoke alarms -- you can't enable that feature on a sensor monitoring a door. You can turn on temperature readings, as well as leak detection. Given the placement of the sensor at the top of the door, that first sensor would have issues detecting leaks. By the time the water level got that high, I'd hope I'd already have noticed a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the $100 Kidde RemoteLync Monitor and the $100 Leeo Smart Alert Nightlight listen for smoke and CO Alarms, and both can listen for alarms anywhere on the floor of a home. A door sensor that also provided this functionality would have been unique and useful. That combination would have made a lot more sense to me than combining leak detection with a door monitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I setup my second sensor as a listener, and the app asked me to place the sensor on the ceiling near my detector. Again, I could enable leak detection for some reason, as well as temperature readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose the leak detection could catch a drip in your ceiling when it rains, but you'd have to place it in the exact right spot, so you'd already know there was a problem. I used my third sensor as an actual leak detector, and set it up in the laundry room of the smart home, with temperature readings turned on for that sensor as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notion can multitask in theory. In practice, you can combine a temperature sensor with any of the other functions, but can't realistically combine anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "At each individual task, Notion performs admirably. I always received a notification within a few seconds of the front door opening. You can also turn notifications off when you're at home, away, or at night. You can manually tell Notion when you leave, or let it use your phone for geofencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the app, you can tap on your door icon to see a simple log of when the door opened and closed. The leak and sound sensors record a similar log. The temperature sensor actually charts its measurements over the course of the past day, week, and month. You can customize notifications with each enabled sense. So with the temperature sensor, you can put it in your wine cellar, pick an ideal temperature threshold, and have Notion let you know if it ever gets hotter or cooler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app lets you add and remove functions from each sensor as you please. Even after the initial setup, you're limited in what senses you can use together, but Notion's main advantage over the competition comes if you change your mind about what you want to monitor. You could fairly easily repurpose a door sensor into a flood sensor in the furnace room if you think there might be a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a flood sensor, Notion picked up water pretty quickly, and the sensor is somewhat water resistant. Notion has two probes on one side of the sensor. When water connects them, it completes a circuit and Notion sends you a push notification. The tech is similar to the other flood sensors we've tested, though some have an option to sound an alarm or interact with your larger smart home to flash the lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also fooled the Notion's flood sensor when I used my finger instead of water to complete the circuit. Plus, Notion's pretty small, so you'll want to be strategic with where you place it if you want it to detect a problem early.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I sounded the smoke alarm, Notion responded quickly with a push notification if it was in the same room. Notion's hearing ability did prove more spotty when I moved the sensor a room away. It's understandable that Notion can't hear as far as the Kidde or Leeo monitors -- both of those plug directly into a wall. Notion needs to conserve power since it's running on a battery. Still, because of this limitation, it's less useful as a safety device as it can realistically only listen for one alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also ran into a strange glitch while testing Notion's listening functionality. The coin cell battery in each Notion sensor is supposed to last a year or two. Mine died within a couple of weeks. According to a company representative, it woke up to listen too frequently, but the problem only affects a small percentage of customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't been able to replicate the problem on a second sensor yet -- I repurposed the laundry room sensor as a listening device. I did run into another glitch with that sensor, as it looked to have lost all temperature data for a morning, but the charts eventually repopulated after a couple of hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same company representative hinted that the next generation of Notion sensors will be arriving shortly -- hopefully by the end of this calendar year. Glitches aside, Notion functions well enough, but if you're interested in the system, it's worth waiting for the second generation of the product to see if it polishes the edges of the experience and handles multitasking better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Notion's $50 sensors are multipurpose, but because of where you need to place them, you'll likely only use them for one task at a time. You can turn on leak sensing in your door monitor, but the app asks you to place it in the top corner of your door. If the water level rises that high, I'm pretty sure you'd know something was wrong already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting started with a $220 three-pack of sensors and a bridge isn't a bad deal, but it's a little expensive. Notion does well enough at each individual task you ask it to do, but it fails to separate itself from the multitude of capable smart home sensors you can find with any of the major platforms such as SmartThings, Wink, and Insteon. If you want connected monitoring, I'd pick what you want to monitor and start with a single purpose sensor. Hopefully, the second generation of Notion sensors will follow through on the promise shown by the first gen, but I wouldn't recommend spending $220 on potential.\n",

      "Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're excited Apple's speaker will be here in December, but it's also been a long time coming. Apple announced its software platform, HomeKit, at WWDC 2014. A few months later, Amazon began selling the Echo -- a $180 plug-in Wi-Fi voice-controlled speaker that answers to the wake word, \"Alexa.\" Alexa's open software makes it easy for developers to create their own uses for the Echo and Amazon's other speakers -- the $20 Dash Wand, $50 Echo Dot, the $130 Tap, the $200 Echo Look  and the $230 Echo Show.\n",

      "Set an Echo on your kitchen counter and ask Alexa to play music and even to control lights, door locks and other home appliances while you prepare dinner. The Google Home, Google's $130 Echo competitor (announced in May 2016) works in much the same way. Say \"OK, Google,\" or \"Hey, Google\" and the Google Assistant will kick into listening mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "HomeKit, by comparison, has lived exclusively in iOS devices for three years, without a companion piece of hardware to call home. That means anyone without an iPhone or iPad was automatically excluded from HomeKit. A standalone Siri speaker should make HomeKit much more accessible to Android customers, children and other family members who'd rather not use an iPhone to ask Siri a question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturers wanting to integrate with Apple's smart-home platform also have to stick an MFi chip in their products before they hit shelves. So instead of a simple software update that would extend to existing customers, companies have to introduce second-generation versions of their products with an MFi chip installed. This happened with the Ecobee3 thermostat, the August Smart Lock, the Lutron Smart Bridge and a wide range of other products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question now is whether Apple's Siri speaker will be enough to compete with Amazon and Google at this late stage. Amazon has set itself apart with its sheer number of Alexa products and open software. And while Google has just one piece of hardware, it's quickly catching up to Alexa in terms of features.

It keeps track of your room's humidity and temperature -- and it adjusts the AC accordingly. International pricing isn't available, but the price converts to about £100 or AU$170.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I tried out the first version of  Ambi Climate two years ago, I was impressed with how it worked and the way it helps save on electrical bills. It reduces the AC once a room hits its optimal temperature, and then turns it back up if it detects a rise in the room's temperature and humidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The magic is in Ambi Lab's data and AI, which figures out a person's preference based on what you tell it through the app. It also considers other information, such as the local weather, to make sure you're feeling comfortable. This feature isn't available on competitor products, such as the Sensibo Sky or Tado.\n",

      "\n",
      "Two years ago, early HomeKit partner Elgato released the Eve Room ($69.80 at Amazon.com), a sensor that tracked temperature, humidity and air quality. CNET gave the device a middling score -- although it worked reliably, its spare features just weren't worth the $80 price tag. Now Elgato is releasing the Eve Degree, an indoor and outdoor upgrade to the Eve Room, and it's much improved. But the standards for a quality smart home gadget have risen in the past two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elgato Eve Degree tracks temperature, humidity and barometric air pressure -- but it doesn't do anything. HomeKit is a stronger platform, though, so the device benefits from being able to trigger other gadgets. But the fact remains: a $70 (£60 or AU$130) gadget that only tracks data had better be blindingly polished. The problem is, the Eve Degree isn't polished enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Elgato's newest gizmo performs some functions admirably, that simply won't be enough to win over consumers in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first problem with the Elgato Eve Degree is just the basic concept: most people don't want to dish out $70 for a sensor. To be fair, the Eve Degree does fit an impressive number of metrics into its data gathering, including temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. And unlike Elgato's earlier indoor sensor, the Eve Degree will work outside (it's water-resistant), and it tracks changes in those variables with impressive agility.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tested the Eve Degree in a climate-controlled room, where I adjusted the temperature and humidity at various times and tracked the rate of change on our own sensors versus the Eve Degree. Elgato's gadget tracked temperature quickly and accurately, staying within a degree of the room's actual temperature the whole time. The Degree tracks humidity accurately, but with a little more latency. It took between 10 and 20 minutes for the sensor to register and record changes. These slight inaccuracies and latencies are minor concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only real problem I found with the Degree's data tracking was when I tested it outside. In direct sunlight, Elgato's sensor lost all accuracy. At 75 degrees Fahrenheit, the sensor read 125 degrees -- a pattern I found with two separate units. Placing the sensor under shade seemed to be an easy enough solution, but that extra step just means extra hassle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest problem with Elgato's Eve Degree is that the device still won't do anything with all its data, other than to graph it. Unless you're a data nut (which some of us are), $70 seems a little steep for that info. By contrast, you can get both digital and analog 3-in-1 sensors of this sort online for less than $40.\n",
      "\n",
      "To really merit the higher price, the Eve Degree needs some standout features -- which it simply doesn't have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument Elgato seems to make with the Eve Degree is that, while the device itself might not perform commands, it can trigger other devices on the Apple HomeKit platform. That's true: You can trigger a plug with a humidifier if the room gets too dry, or close the shades if it's getting too hot. But most of those triggers can be set up using a connected thermostat (which tracks and controls home temperature) or a basic sensor like the one that comes with the Ecobee thermostat. Paying an additional $70 for that trigger seems like overkill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if someone did want to trigger HomeKit devices using the Eve Degree, the interface for setting up those scenes is convoluted (a representative for Elgato said this was because of a \"limitation\" on the part of Apple's platform). Essentially, you can't create triggered automations in the iOS Home app using the Eve Degree. Instead, you must create them in the Elgato app, then you can edit them (to a limited degree) in the Home app. Put simply, it's a cumbersome system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite many of my critiques, the Eve Degree offers some cool data-gathering features that could be helpful to users with a particular set of needs. But beyond that niche appeal, the Eve Degree just isn't worth $70 for most people.\n",

      "Belkin WeMo Dimmer Wi-Fi Light Switch\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The WeMo Dimmer is the latest gadget in Belkin's likable lineup of smart plugs and switches. At $80, it's essentially a fancier version of the original Belkin WeMo Light Switch that adds in a few new features — namely, the ability to dim your lights up and down as you see fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like other WeMo gadgets, the WeMo Dimmer uses Wi-Fi to connect directly with your home network, which means you won't need to plug a special hub into your router. For some, that'll make it a more appealing option than Z-Wave switches from names like GE, or even Lutron's very strong Caseta switches. At $80, it's also very likely to be less expensive than the soon-to-be-released iDevices Dimmer Switch (the non-dimmable version of that switch already sells for $100). And, with new support for Apple HomeKit coming soon, it can claim compatibility with just about all of the major smart home platforms, as well as the top three voice controllers: Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that positions the WeMo Dimmer pretty nicely here, and after testing it out in the CNET Smart Home, I'm convinced that there are plenty of reasons for WeMo loyalists and smart home newbies alike to give Belkin's new smart switch a shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WeMo Dimmer is the best-looking WeMo gadget to date, with a premium feel unlike the bargain-bin basic design of the switches that came before it. Much of this is thanks to the new touch-sensitive dimming controls. Along with the on/off button at the bottom of the switch, you can glide your finger up and down the groove in the center of the dimmer to adjust the brightness, with tiny LED lights illuminating as you go. It looks modern, and feels fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belkin did a nice job with those indicator lights, too — they're great for checking the approximate brightness level at a glance, but they aren't bright enough on their own to be annoying. When you turn the switch off, a single light will remain lit to show you where you left the brightness. Turn the switch back on, and the lights will return to that same level. You can also use the dimmer's touch slider to adjust that preset dimming point while the switch is off — another thoughtful touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the touch-centric design might take some getting used to. While the groove and the LED indicator lights definitely help, fumbling around for touch-sensitive dimming controls in a dark room will never be as comfortable as flipping a switch. To that end, I wish that the on/off button was a bit more pronounced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you begin using the WeMo Dimmer, you've got to install the thing. Belkin made the setup about as easy as hard-wiring a light switch can get. The Dimmer's four wires — line, load, ground and neutral — are clearly labeled on the back of the switch, and the in-the-box instructions are a lot of help, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one of the clearly illustrated caveats in those instructions reveals what is arguably the WeMo Dimmer's biggest flaw: It doesn't work in three-way switch setups, where you've got more than one light switch wired to the same light or bank of lights. Multi-switch setups like that are fairly common in today's homes, and while competitors like Lutron, iDevices and GE all offer smart switches that work with them, WeMo doesn't. That's a big, puzzling misstep.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked Belkin's team about it, and a representative told me that they're \"actively looking for a way to support three-way switches,\" but added that they have no details to offer at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the arrival of the original WeMo Light Switch back in 2013, users have been clamoring for a version that can dim the lights. Belkin could have released exactly that with no other changes and people probably would have been happy. Instead, Belkin has released a dimmer packed with additional features. Here's a quick rundown of what's new:\n",
      "\n",
      "Coupled with the dimming controls, that's a lot of new utility for WeMo users, and all of it worked really well throughout my tests. I appreciated the quick and easy fade timer function, and the fact that the app even includes a countdown after you start one. It's an especially nice feature if you want a gradual fade to help lull you to sleep (and if you want to schedule recurring fades at specific times, the app will let you do that, too).\n",
      "\n",
      "Those native long press controls are a nice touch, too. Long presses were originally a feature of the first WeMo Light Switch's IFTTT channel, letting you trigger a recipe on the online automation service with a single tap. It's one of the WeMo Light Switch's top selling points, and I'm happy to see Belkin double down on it by bringing it directly into the WeMo app, though you'll still need to use IFTTT if you want to trigger third-party services or devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the app feels well-designed and fully featured — enough so to hang tough with strong competition from the likes of Lutron. My only app-related complaint is that it still crashes on occasion, and feels a little bit laggy at times. The app timed out on me while I waited for it to finish pairing with the dimmer during the setup process, an issue I've encountered with multiple WeMo devices on multiple Wi-Fi networks. All was well after force-closing the app and restarting it, but it's still less than ideal as far as first impressions go.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other tiny app quibble: the lights don't change in real-time as you dial the brightness up and down in the app. You'll only see a change when you lift your finger off of the slider bar. That might seem insignificant, but it forces you to use a trial-and-error approach as you try to hit a specific level of brightness. Here's hoping Belkin can fix that with a firmware update sometime soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the bevy of new features, Belkin's other key strength is its wide slate of third-party integrations. WeMo gear now works with Amazon's Alexa, the Google Assistant, the Nest Learning Thermostat, and a whole host of other gadgets and platforms thanks to robust support for IFTTT (the WeMo Dimmer's IFTTT channel isn't live just yet, but it might be by the time you're reading this — Belkin tells me it'll be up and running by the end of this week).\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, the new kid on the block will be Apple HomeKit, the iOS-based smart home platform that brings Siri controls into play. Users will need to buy Belkin's soon-to-be-released WeMo Bridge in order to sync up with HomeKit, but it's still a welcome addition to the roster.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for security concerns, here's how Belkin describes its efforts at protecting WeMo users from getting hacked:\n",
      "\n",
      "Belkin deserves credit on this last point — in the rare instances where someone exposed a vulnerability with the WeMo platform, Belkin's engineers have acted quickly to inform users and push out firmware updates within a matter of days.\n",
      "\n",
      "At $80, the WeMo Dimmer isn't as outstanding a value as the $35 WeMo Mini, but it's still a very good product that gets most of the little things right. Still, it misses a big thing with its lack of three-way switch support, an omission that may stop a wide number of potential customers from buying in. That said, if you can forgive that shortcoming (or if your home doesn't have any three-way switches that need smartening), then there's a lot to like here, and plenty of reasons to consider trying it out for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lightbar — A multi-color LED at the bottom of the dimmer illuminates whenever the light changes to let you know why the light is changing (i.e. white for manual adjustments, green for third-party automations, etc.)Night Mode — You can customize the dimmer's maximum brightness during late evening hours to ensure that the light isn't too blinding if you turn it on during a midnight bathroom run.Fade timers — With a few quick taps in the WeMo app, you can tell the dimmer to gradually fade the lights out for a custom length of up to thirty minutes.Away Mode — Put the dimmer (or any other WeMo device) into Away Mode and it'll randomly turn on and off to make it look like you're home when you really aren't.Native long press controls — You can now program custom actions that you trigger by holding the dimmer's on/off button for more than two seconds directly in the WeMo app. These include turning other WeMo devices on and off and putting the dimmer into Away Mode. Previously, you needed to use IFTTT to program long presses.\n",
      "Dojo\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First announced back in November 2015, the Dojo is finally shipping today. From what its maker -- BullGuard -- has to say, it seems a cool way to easily add a layer of security to your home network.\n",
      "\n",
      "BullGuard claims that the Dojo will protect all internet-of-things (IoT) smart devices in your home, such as smart alarms, thermostats, baby monitors, smart appliances, lighting, locks and so on. Considering how smart home devices seem easily hacked, the Dojo sounds like a great idea. Let's take a closer look.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dojo comes in two pieces: one is a base that connects to your home Wi-Fi network; the other is the Dojo itself, which looks like a large pebble. BullGuard says you can leave the Dojo on the base or place it around the house wherever you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once connected to a network, the Dojo can automatically detect IoT devices and monitor their traffic, something BullGuard calls metadata, to detect and stop suspicious activities. The device has rings of lights that indicate the security status of the network. Green rings mean everything is OK; yellow rings mean that a risk has been detected and automatically taken care of. Red rings, however, indicate that an action must be taken in the Dojo smartphone app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dojo app is available for both Android and iOS and is used for both the setup process and the ongoing management of the device. You can use it at home and when you're out and about. This means, however, that the Dojo is connected to BullGuard at all times, which can be a privacy risk. BullGuard says this cloud-based connection affords the Dojo artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, allowing it to tailor its security policy for each device on the home Wi-Fi network. All this makes it quite cool, though the Cujo that came out earlier this year has similar features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dojo is not all cool, though. For one, it only supports Wi-Fi, meaning it won't work with Z-Wave or ZigBee devices out of the box, though it can indirectly protect them via their centralized hub, such as the Samsung SmartThings.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's hardest to stomach, however, is the cost. At launch, the Dojo comes with a $199 price tag (for now it's only available in the US, but that roughly converts to £155 or AU$265), which includes a 12-month service fee. After that, you have to keep paying to use it at $99 a year or $10 a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "For that much, you're better off getting a high-end router or Wi-Fi system ($296.62 at Amazon.com) with built-in security features, like one from Asus (such as the RT-AC68u -- which currently costs less than the Dojo's initial price -- or a later model), the Synology WRT2600AC or the TP-Link Deco M5, just to name a few. These routers offer free lifetime security protection for the entire network, not just IoT devices. And if you like the ability to monitor your home devices using a mobile app, it might be a good idea to wait for the recently announced Asus Blue Cave or the Norton Core.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, if you have a lot of IoT devices and have no idea how to secure them, getting the Dojo will give you some extra protection -- assuming the device is as effective as BullGuard claims -- and peace of mind. On the other hand, if you already know how to change the default password of your devices to something strong, which you should do anyway, the Dojo might be an expensive and unnecessary device to have in your home.\n",
      "LeakSmart Complete Home Water Protection System\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dream of the smart home doesn't just mean voice control or futuristic touchscreens; It means your home reacts -- to you and to its own needs. This type of responsiveness is what LeakSmart creates with its Complete Home Water Protection System: a leak sensor, water valve and connecting hub, all packaged for $425.\n",
      "\n",
      "The logic behind the LeakSmart System is simple: when a pipe bursts and your home floods, every second wasted means more damage done and more money lost. A sensor alone could alert you to the disaster, but with its connected valve, LeakSmart can stymie the source of the damage within seconds. It's a sound solution, it works effectively and the benefit certainly outweighs the cost. But the price tag doesn't have to be so high, and that fact alone will likely turn off many potential users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paying $425 for any smart home system should give you pause -- it's a lot of money. For that price, LeakSmart gives you a $70 flood sensor, $230 smart valve and $150 ZigBee hub to connect them (you get $25 off for buying the whole package).\n",
      "\n",
      "For comparison, ZigBee flood sensors generally cost around $40. Hubs vary, but the most affordable ones clock in around $100. Connected valves -- the mechanisms that actually shut off your water main in the case of a flood -- range widely, from $100 to $430. Altogether, if you bought a hub and sensor from Insteon, and a valve from SmartHome Select, you could set up an alternative to LeakSmart's for a bit over $200. That leaves LeakSmart's System in the \"over-priced\" range.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, many other competitors are equally over-priced (the FortrezZ valve alone costs $430, for instance). And luckily, most users won't pay the full $425 for LeakSmart, because other distributors sell the Complete Home Water Protection System for significantly less.\n",
      "\n",
      "LeakSmart might be as over-priced as its competition, but it distinguishes itself in a few ways. First off, the design of the flood sensor is pretty solid. It's one of the only devices on the market that's truly waterproof, it measures temperature (alerting users to pipe-bursting conditions) and it detects water in seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "If LeakSmart's sensor has one weakness, it's that the water-sensing probes are close together and small. That means, unlike more creatively designed devices (like Fibaro's, D-Link's or Roost's), the LeakSmart sensor doesn't cover much area. So you'll want to be careful where exactly you leave the device, especially on uneven floors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connected shut-off valve is just as functional as the sensor. It responds reliably to commands, and when I tested it, the valve shut off consistently within 5 seconds of the sensor detecting water. The hardware itself isn't quite as heavy-duty as the FortrezZ's valve, but it's certainly effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "LeakSmart's system works with Wink and Lowes' Iris integration platforms, but it stands alone just as well. The LeakSmart hub connects to an app on your phone, sending texts or push alerts when water is detected. The app won't win any awards for user interface, but it works well enough. Given the increasing energy efficiency of Wi-Fi flood sensors (some boasting two-year battery life), though, the question remains: why does LeakSmart need its own hub, let alone one that adds $150 to the price tag?\n",
      "\n",
      "The negatives are clear: the hub complicates installation, and it acts as a necessary go-between for your phone, sensor and valve, thereby adding a step for potential communication breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the hub does add one positive feature: If the Wi-Fi fails, the leak sensor will still tell the valve to shut off. If the power goes out, though, you're out of luck unless you have a backup battery for the hub -- a missed opportunity for LeakSmart's designers to really disaster-proof their system.\n",
      "\n",
      "LeakSmart's Complete Home Water Protection System detects floods and, more importantly, responds. For anyone who's paid thousands of dollars toward repairs after discovering their basement ankle-deep in water, $425 probably seems like a worthy price for protection. And LeakSmart does perform admirably.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the product isn't perfect, and it certainly doesn't merit its price tag. If you want to systematically cover spots vulnerable to burst pipes (below sinks, beside water heaters, behind large appliances), you'll need more than one leak sensor. But making LeakSmart feel like the system it claims to be isn't worth $70 per flood sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should you buy the LeakSmart System? If you live in a house with old or freezing-prone pipes, getting a system like LeakSmart's could save you thousands. And if you can find the LeakSmart Complete Home Water Protection System for, say, $200 -- go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for most people, $425 just seems like too high a premium, even for the assurance of a flood-stopping system.\n",
      "Essential Home\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Andy Rubin has turned his attention to the kitchen counter and the smart home. Alongside the Essential Phone, the founder of Android on Tuesday debuted the Essential Home -- a countertop smart speaker that has a lot in common with the Amazon Echo and the Google Home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the Echo and the Home, you'll be able to issue commands with your voice to search the internet for info, play music, and control your smart home. Unlike the two existing smart speakers, the Essential Home has a screen and will offer full touch controls in addition to voice controls. Supposedly, you'll even be able to interact with the Essential Home just by looking at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Home will aim to differentiate itself further by processing as many of your commands locally as possible -- the Echo and Google Home function entirely through the cloud, and gather data from your commands. It'll also offer proactive notifications from the get-go -- a feature still in the works for Amazon and Google's competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essential's example of a notification hints that it'll integrate with your calendar and have maps and traffic data as well -- it'll let you know you need to leave early for an appointment if traffic is getting backed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the core of all of this functionality will be Essential's new operating system, called Ambient OS. From the pictures, it looks somewhat similar to Apple's Watch OS -- with a simple interface for controlling different devices. Essential is promising much more, saying in a blog post that Ambient OS is \"the API to your home that enables the creation of applications that extend the reach of a single device.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With an open developer kit at launch, the Ambient OS wants to make controlling your smart home seamless, and will be aware of devices, people and context. Supposedly, you won't even have to do any setup to use the Essential Home to control you connected gadgets. The Ambient OS will automatically \"introduce itself\" to new and existing devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Essential Home theoretically learns about your routines, and can let you know if you left the lights on. Wired reported that at launch, the Home will not only work with big smart home platforms such as Nest, SmartThings and HomeKit, but it will also tie together the major smart home assistants -- Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essential hasn't announced a price or a specific release date for the Home yet. Undoubtedly, the Essential Home won't launch with quite as many integrations as the Amazon Echo -- Alexa has more than 10,000 third-party skills. Essential's behind the scenes choreography will need to tangibly make the smart home easier to use if it's going to be the better controller for your connected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the Home, Rubin's new venture announced a phone as well. Both devices will have a lot to prove to stand out from tough competition.\n",
      "Belkin WeMo Bridge, HomeKit-enabled\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Belkin's WeMo lineup of connected plugs and switches will soon support Apple HomeKit, the smart home platform that lets you control compatible gadgets using Siri voice commands. The catch? You'll need to buy a new WeMo Bridge and plug it into your router.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's still welcome news for WeMo users, especially since the Bridge will bring retroactive HomeKit support to all existing WeMo gadgets. You won't need to buy any new switches or plugs -- just the new Bridge. Pricing and availability is yet to be announced, but Belkin tells us it will arrive by this fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding HomeKit support fills the most glaring gap in Belkin's otherwise impressive slate of third-party integrations. WeMo Switches were among the first smart home gadgets to take advantage of the free online automation service IFTTT back in 2013. In the years since, it's added support for the Nest Learning Thermostat, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and many more. With HomeKit added to that list, WeMo can rightly call itself one of the smart home's best-connected brands.\n",

      "The Bridge won't be Belkin's first new WeMo gadget of the year, or even its second. In January, Belkin debuted the new WeMo Mini smart switch and WeMo Dimmer light switch -- the latter of which we're currently testing out at the CNET Smart Home. Expect to see a review of it in the coming days, as well as an update this fall when the WeMo Bridge arrives.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike most DIY security cameras, Olive & Dove's $199 live streaming HD RemoCam offers infrared device control. Essentially, it's a secondary IR remote for your TV, desk fan -- and other basic home electronics. It's a unique feature (if not a little outdated), but it's pretty limited, too. RemoCam has to be facing the device you want it to control and that's it as far as \"smart\" features go; the camera doesn't currently support any smart home platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RemoCam is all right overall, but its features fall far behind most of the DIY cams we've tested. That ultimately makes it difficult to recommend.\n",

      "RemoCam's 720p HD camera has a narrow 70-degree field of view, but it also has a 335-degree panning angle, a 95-degree tilting angle and a 3x digital zoom. Opting for a PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) camera over a fixed-angle model that doesn't rotate horizontally or vertically is a matter of choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of fixed-angle models like Piper's $280 NV cover a wide field of view, typically at least 120 degrees (the NV has an impressive 180-degree field of view). A PTZ model's viewing angle is often smaller, but it makes up for that with its ability to move to capture activity happening outside the field of view. RemoCam's pan and tilt functionality is quiet and easy to adjust in the RemoCam app.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the camera is relatively easy to setup, the app could look better. Little details like the way the \"Speak\" and \"Listen\" icons cover the words slightly made the app seem like a beta version (see the screenshot to the right).\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, everything worked pretty well. You can pull up the live feed whenever you want, the camera automatically switches to night-vision mode in low-light conditions and you can sound the built-in siren on-demand (or  program it to sound when there's motion activity). The motion sensor was much too responsive, though, delivering continuous push alerts even with the sensitivity setting set to \"Low\" in the app. The quality of the night vision could be better, too.\n",

      "I wouldn't recommend Olive & Dove's $199 RemoCam. The infrared control is sort of interesting, but extremely limited; the camera also doesn't work with any smart home platforms. And, while its live streaming mode worked fine, its motion alerts were much too frequent.

It doesn't have live streaming or third-party smart home integrations and it costs $199 -- the same as the competition. For me, RemoBell just isn't worth it.\n",

      "(Note: RemoBell will be available overseas later this year. Converted, that's roughly £155 and AU$265.)\n",
      "\n",
      "RemoBell has decent specs, but they don't quite stack up to other $199 models. Take a look at the comparison chart below to see for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yep, RemoBell's field of view is narrower, it doesn't have live streaming (to conserve battery power) and you have to pay more for less cloud storage. Ring charges $3 per month for 6 months of storage and SkyBell offers free storage. August is the exception -- it charges more than Olive & Dove for the same 30-day cloud storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Olive & Dove told me IFTTT and Amazon Alexa integration is in the works, but RemoBell doesn't currently have any smart-home partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "RemoBell performed fine, delivering push alerts either when the doorbell detected motion or when someone rang the doorbell. It then lets you (temporarily) view a live feed of the person and talk with them via built-in intercom capabilities. Of course, performance will vary based on the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the install location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Olive & Dove's RemoBell is a fine connected doorbell, but it just doesn't offer enough features to make it worthwhile. Look instead to Ring, SkyBell or August. SkyBell's HD buzzer is particularly appealing, given that it offers free cloud storage and more smart home partnerships than the rest.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thermostat ($110.99 at Amazon.com) maker Emerson today announced the $200 Sensi Touch.  Available starting in June, the Sensi Touch Wi-Fi thermostat shares a lot of similarities with the $130 Sensi that I reviewed in 2016. But not everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The Sensi Touch will only be available in the US at launch. Pricing converts to roughly  £150 and AU$265 at the current exchange rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "As its name suggests, the Sensi Touch ditches the bland, plasticky hardware for a more modern touchscreen look. It's a significant improvement at a glance, but the Sensi Touch is still lagging behind design-forward models like the Nest Learning Thermostat. The Sensi Touch actually reminds me of Honeywell's Wi-Fi Smart thermostat somewhat, which I reviewed back in 2013. While that model is still sold today, Honeywell has since introduced the Lyric and the Lyric T5 -- both of which are more attractive than the original Wi-Fi Smart (and the Sensi Touch).\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the touchscreen upgrade, this model is also equipped with an Apple MFi chip. The MFi chip is a required hardware component if you want your product to work with Apple's HomeKit smart home platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on a related topic, Emerson is replacing the original $130 Sensi with Sensi 2.0. The second-gen Sensi will still cost $130, and it will still have the same utilitarian design --- the only change is the addition of an MFi chip. Like the new Sensi Touch, Sensi 2.0 is also slated to hit stores in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "HomeKit compatibility gives iPhone users access to their Sensi Touch (and other HomeKit products) in the iOS 10 Home app. It also means Siri can control the thermostat. Emerson has a related Amazon Alexa skill as well, so folks with an Echo, Echo Dot or Tap can adjust their thermostat via voice commands.\n",

      "Tend Secure Lynx Indoor Camera\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Today's home security market follows a pretty predictable pattern. Most DIY security cameras come with high-definition live streaming video, cloud storage for that video, some kind of motion detection feature and typically cost about $200. Tend Secure's Lynx Indoor camera has all of those things, but it costs just $60 (£45/AU$80).\n",
      "\n",
      "Yep, you read that right -- 1080p HD resolution, 7-day free event-based cloud storage and advanced, facial recognition-based motion alerts all for 60 bucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lynx doesn't currently integrate with any major smart home platforms, although it is slated to work with the Google Assistant by the end of July. Its removable base is oddly designed, too, and doesn't hold the camera in place well. It isn't a perfect camera, but its features and overall value make it easy to recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it's great to see a budget HD DIY camera on the market, Tend Secure should've thrown a little more money at the Lynx's design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The base that's supposed to hold the camera upright on a table or other flat surface doesn't quite get the job done. As you can see in the image to the right, you simply slide the camera into the base without a latch closure or other locking mechanism to keep it from moving around.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could tape it down or skip a tabletop installation altogether (wall-mounting hardware comes with your purchase), but it isn't ideal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera looks fine otherwise, if not a little utilitarian. Its small size does help it blend into surroundings more easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've reviewed three DIY cameras that ID specific faces: The ArcSoft Simplicam, the Netatmo Welcome -- and Tend Secure's Lynx. Every other camera touting advanced motion detection can only tell you when it sees a person, any person, without being able to recognize specific faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Simplicam is no longer widely available for purchase, but originally retailed for $150 (about £115/AU$200 converted); Netatmo's Welcome is still sold, but costs $199 (£150/AU$265). While Simplicam charged an optional monthly fee for extra features like cloud storage, the Welcome relies on local storage in the form of a microSD card. If you have a strong preference for local storage and want facial recognition, the Welcome is a reasonable choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you don't mind using the Lynx's free 7-day event-based cloud storage instead (specifically, it will save 7 days of downloadable motion-related video clips on a rolling basis), you get all of the same things, including arguably better facial-recognition performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how the Lynx's facial-recognition software works:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Lynx never got a face wrong during my testing, we did have to walk pretty close to the camera and stare at it for at least a couple of seconds before it detected anyone's face. If I walked quickly by the camera feed, it would only deliver the generic motion alert and not detect me. Over time, though, it got a little better, and started to recognize me even when I barely stopped in front of the camera. The more images of you it logs at various (and often unflattering) angles, the better it gets at detecting your face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting everything up in the app was pretty simple. Download the Tend Secure app for Android or iPhone and follow the instructions on the screen. You need to be connected to your local Wi-Fi network, but it only takes a few minutes to get the Lynx's live stream working.\n",
      "\n",
      "One source of potential annoyance: If you move the camera to a new location with a new Wi-Fi network, you'll have to start the configuration process all over again. I began testing the Lynx at our CNET Appliances office and finished testing at the CNET Smart Home across town. Fortunately, reconfiguring the camera didn't take long;  it also miraculously saved my original facial recognition library. My favorite cameras make it easier, though, by simply letting you update the Wi-Fi details in the app without having to reset everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $60 Tend Secure Lynx Indoor camera is truly unique. It's inexpensive, but manages to offer a lot of the same features as $200 security cameras. The free cloud storage is also a huge bonus, as there's no need to worry about monthly fees to access advanced features like watching saved clips or review facial recognition alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can work around the Lynx's odd design, you're left with a solid live streaming camera that gets smarter over time.\n",
      "Smalt\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not even your simple salt shaker is safe from a smart-home upgrade. A company called Herb & Body will launch an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign June 15 for the Smalt, a Bluetooth-connected salt dispenser that also streams music and illuminates a room with color-changing lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, you read that correctly -- a device with a profile similar to the Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) and Google Home ($129.00 at Dell Home) smart speakers, but the added ability to add more flavor to your food. Smalt is a salt shaker with a Ph.D. in being extra.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Salt does not have to be smart, but humans do,\" Smalt founder Bipan Singh told me. \"What makes us smart is access to information. Smalt is a mode to measure, track and control sodium consumption, if one really cares to do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Singh said he wants to raise at least $100,000 through Smalt's upcoming Indiegogo campaign. The company has yet to finalize how much the Smalt will cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how the Smalt will work: You can use a dial on the device itself or an app to select how much salt you want to dispense. The Smalt will then track how much salt you're eating, Singh said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why add music streaming and lights? That's what the people want, at least according to market research he's collected, Singh said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no disputing the fact that ambiance plays a great role in enhancing the meals we consume,\" he said. \"Ambiance includes centerpieces, lighting in the dining area and music ... Since all the elements exist but are separate, why not combine them in a contemporary portable design to offer something fun for the dining area?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Singh also points to products like a connected hairbrush and floating speakers as evidence that there's a market for making ordinary products like a salt shaker smart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If all these products have a place, Smalt is definitely not unnecessary and for sure it is not taking tech too far,\" he said, perhaps a little defensively.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've trekked through an Ikea showroom recently, then you might have noticed the dedicated section for lamps and LED light bulbs. Now, you're likely to see  \t \tsmart lights on display, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ikea calls this connected lighting lineup 'Tradfri' (Danish for 'wireless'), and it includes a number of entry points, including  a $25 smart bulb and motion detector bundle and an $80 starter kit (£69 in the UK) that comes with two bulbs, a wireless remote, and the gateway hub that plugs into your router to let you control the lights using an app on your Android or iOS device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ikea's approach here keeps things simple -- too much so for me to recommend it. With relatively few features and zero third-party connections, it lags far behind the two-bulb Philips Hue White starter kit, which costs less. That said, keep Tradfri in mind if you just want a quick-and-easy dimming or motion detection solution, because there's value to be had if you're willing to skip the app-enabled smarts of Ikea's gateway hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "I drove two hours north to the nearest Ikea last month to pick up a new piece of furniture, and while I was there, I tossed one of those $80 starter kits into my cart. And, after a month spent testing everything out at both the   CNET Smart Home and CNET Smart Apartment, I can report that it works as advertised, letting you control the bulbs from your phone or automate them to turn on and off at specific times with relative ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's really all that it does. There's no vacation mode that'll cycle the lights on and off to simulate occupancy while you're away, nor can you customize fade durations for those automated lighting changes. There's nothing by way of third-party compatibility, either -- no HomeKit, no Alexa, no IFTTT, no SmartThings, no nothin'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really the only features of note are that the bulbs have those three color-temperature settings, and that the hub wisely includes   two-factor authentication during setup by way of a device-specific QR code that you'll need to scan with your phone's camera. That's the same tactic Apple HomeKit uses to keep gadgets secure, and it's a clever approach. Still, it's not much to get excited about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even worse -- at $80, the two-bulb Tradfri starter kit costs 10 bucks   more than the two-bulb Philips Hue White starter kit that I awarded Editors' Choice last September. That kit offers wide, well-developed compatibility with just about every smart-home platform you could think to throw at it (including everything mentioned above), and you get the option of adding Hue's color-changing smart bulbs a la carte, too. The Tradfri kit might have been compelling a couple of years ago, but in 2017, it's much too basic and too far behind the curve for me to recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, let's talk for a minute about two other Tradfri entry points: the $25 motion-detector bundle mentioned above and   a $20 bundle that includes a bulb and a wireless knob that can dim it up and down. Neither one requires the gateway hub -- instead, you pair the motion sensor or dimmer knob directly with the bulbs they come with, or with any other Tradfri bulbs you decide to add later (both the dimmer and the motion detector can control up to 10 bulbs at once -- you pair by holding them close to the bulb and pressing a button for a few seconds).\n",
      "\n",
      "I like both of these offerings quite a bit. The motion-detecting combo is one of the most affordable ways of getting your bedroom lamp to turn on when you enter the room that I've seen (a sort-of-similar and since-discontinued   Belkin WeMo Switch-and-motion-detector combo that I also liked very much was selling for $80 just a few years ago).\n",
      "\n",
      "You won't be able to do much more with it than that, but if a simple motion-activated light is all you're looking for, then by all means, tack it onto your next Ikea order. My only complaints? Though mountable with screws or sticky tape, the detector isn't designed to sit on a table or shelf unless you turn it sideways. Also:  the little dials on the back that let you customize how long it stays lit without motion before turning off are awfully tiny. Yes, I'm nitpicking.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the wireless dimmer, it, too, does a simple job well, and might make a particularly good pick for a kids' room reading lamp. It's a unique, neat-looking design, available in white, black or yellow. The colored bit uses a magnet to sit in a little white cradle and detect when you're rotating it. It worked reasonably well in my tests, though it definitely wasn't nearly as precise as you'll get with more sophisticated dimming hardware. Then again, this is a $20 lighting bundle we're talking about, so there's room to forgive a cheap build so long as the thing works. And it does.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also happy to report that these bulbs, like many Ikea bulbs   I've tested previously, are very decent in their own right. Both the fixed, soft white Tradfri bulbs that come in the cheap kits and the white-light-adjustable bulbs that come in the $80 gateway kit put out well over 900 lumens at their default settings, which is noticeably brighter than a standard 60W incandescent, and unlike Philips Hue White Ambiance bulbs, the brightness doesn't dip noticeably at any of the alternative white light settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both bulbs also dim well using their respective dimming mechanisms (the app and the wireless knob accessory). Each one dialed down well below 10 percent, and neither showed a visible flicker. The bulbs also stayed above 90 percent of their initial brightness throughout my entire 90-minute tests -- a very good result, and one that's indicative of a well-built bulb capable of handling heat build-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ikea's $80 Tradfri starter kit tries to sell itself as a worthwhile smart lighting platform -- but I just don't see it. For that money (less, actually), I'd much rather have the Philips Hue White starter kit, complete with a gateway device that actually works with other bulbs, gadgets, and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, don't discount the wireless dimming and motion detection bundles. They barely qualify as connected home devices at all, but at $20 and $25, respectively, they're a worthy quick fix for slightly smarter lighting in something like a bedroom lamp -- especially if you'd rather leave your router out of the equation altogether.\n",
      "Lighthouse Interactive Assistant\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While it looks like a fairly typical smart home camera on the outside, the Lighthouse has advanced 3D mapping built-in -- tech similar to that which helps self-driving cars navigate. As a result, it could be the first smart home cam to not only watch over your home, but to understand it as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Place the Lighthouse -- a connected cam from a tech startup of the same name -- on a table facing the door, or mount it on a wall overlooking a room, and it'll do the basics we've come to expect from the likes of Piper, Nest Cam and Canary -- it's a camera you can connect to your Wi-Fi network, so you can check on your home from afar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the basics, the Lighthouse supposedly knows the difference between adults, children and pets. It learns faces to recognize people, and will let you know if it spots someone new. It should even understand actions like running.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that sounds fantastic, and I saw it work to an extent in a short demo over a video call, but we've yet to see most of these features successfully implemented in other smart home cams. If the Lighthouse meets its promises, its tech could propel the cam past the competition, but it has much to prove.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lighthouse team also looks to have built a robust voice search engine into the camera's app -- another tall task that is exciting in theory. During the demo, a company rep asked the app if someone walked her dog while she was away. The app found the appropriate clip.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lighthouse uses geofencing on your phone to help it track whether you're home or away, and you'll have to help it learn faces at first by identifying different pictures it captures of your family members. After that, you can pull up footage by searching for \"kids running during the afternoon.\" The voice recognition software in the app is supposedly smart enough to recognize the specifics in that search.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also ask it to keep you up to date with a voice command such as \"tell me when my kids come home\" or alternatively \"tell me if my kids aren't home by 4 p.m.\" Other security cameras sense motion and let you set up rules based on the time of day, but the Lighthouse wants to let you speak intuitively to your smart home, and see only the info relevant to what you need to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can get a notification based on specific actions -- such as if your pet jumps up on the counter. You'll even be notified if someone waves at the camera, and you can then pull up the app to chat with them via the two-way audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Netatmo Welcome also offers facial recognition and tracks who comes and goes. Like the Lighthouse, the Welcome will notify you if it spots someone new. Netatmo's outdoor cam, the Presence, can discern between people, animals and cars. Both Netatmo cams work pretty well -- but not flawlessly, and the Welcome takes a while to reliably learn faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nest Cam's new Nest Aware feature helps it tell the difference between people and pets, and it lets you set specific activity zones for motion alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In theory, the Lighthouse will stretch well beyond those capabilities. It'll also be quite expensive, and sold only as part of a subscription service -- the cloud learning tech is what makes the product unique, the company says. Starting today, you can preorder the Lighthouse on the company's site and you can expect your device in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll pay $400 for the cam and a one-year subscription, $500 for the cam and three years or $600 for the cam and five years. You can buy plenty of standalone security cameras with no monthly fees for $200, so the Lighthouse has a tall barrier to entry. For your money, Lighthouse stores footage for 30 rolling days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lighthouse will only be available in the US to start, but those prices convert to roughly £310 or AU$540 for one year and £460 or AU$815 for three. The subscription costs $10 a month (£7/AU$14) after your initial term expires. Subtract that monthly cost from the one-year bundle, and Lighthouse is an expensive $280 on its own vs. $200 for the excellent Nest Cam. (If you cancel your subscription, you'll still get live streaming and security alerts, but that's it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you're locked into a lofty upfront price and then a month-by-month subscription fee to keep most of the camera's features working, I'd recommend waiting to make sure it manages to be as smart as promised. From the intuitive voice searches to recognizing faces and actions, Lighthouse is advancing on a lot of fronts simultaneously. If it does come through, it could give the smart home a sizeable boost of helpful intelligence.\n",
      "ShapeScale\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to track your weight over a period time, I'd imagine you'd get a smart scale. But if you think weight-tracking isn't quite giving you the proper motivation to make the health changes you need in your life, perhaps something like ShapeScale is more your speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, ShapeScale ships with an app that tracks your weight, but it also does something I've never seen before. It uses a robotic telescoping arm that circles your body and spits out a 360-degree image. The camera array can measure the tiny differences in your body's size and plot the change for you to analyze over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked with co-founder Alex Wayenberg about ShapeScale's philosophy, and on paper it's a reasonable approach. Too many fitness gadgets focus on numbers and data that don't necessarily translate into helpful information for someone looking to improve their overall well-being. ShapeScale can give you massive amounts of data, but it also wants you to be able to see the slight changes in your body that you yourself wouldn't be able to notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "So basically, all the motivation ShapeScale is going to give you is the day-to-day visuals that chart your physical change. And let's be honest, that's what most people care about anyway. Is that diet working? Look for yourself. Is this new bicep exercise making my arms bigger? Go look and see.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are a few places where ShapeScale starts to lose me. First off, it's going to go for $500. I'm a health gadget outsider, but that seems like a serious investment in a single platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was the demo I received in our office. ShapeScale won't arrive until 2018 -- but that's a good thing. There's some wonkiness that needs to be worked out. While it sounded like the prototype got a little dinged up traveling to New York from San Francisco, we weren't able to successfully scan my body until the unit was repaired.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn't get to see a fully workable version of the final product. That has us skeptical, too. There's also a some refinement that will need to go into the final product -- the balance of the scale, the reliability of its moving parts and the overall ease of use are all things to remain concerned about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final scan we received was pretty cool (you can play with a 3D version of me above), but the fidelity didn't come close to the demo scan we saw when ShapeScale was in-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "If ShapeScale ties up all these loose ends, it could be an interesting luxury fitness gadget. But if not, it'll be a tough sell at $500.\n",

      "Not only does the Sunrise Smart Pillow promise to track movement with built-in sensors, its color-changing LEDs are supposed to help you wake up in the morning. The speakers can play nature sounds or white noise to help you fall asleep -- and music to get you ready for your day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mode Modern's smart alarm is also designed to wake you \"in your lightest phase of sleep.\" Review your sleep score in the related app and listen to audio recordings taken during periods of interrupted sleep to help identify the disturbance.\n",

Sleep Number's smart mattress works with Nest and Fitbit and Cambridge Sound Management's Nightingale works with Alexa and IFTTT. Sunrise's lack of partnerships could potentially hurt its broader appeal in the smart home market.\n",

(The Ecobee4 is only available in the US; at the current exchange rate, pricing converts to roughly £190/AU$330.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only does the Ecobee4 work incredibly well, it's the smartest thermostat we've ever reviewed. For these reasons, we've given it a CNET Editors' Choice Award. If you don't want all of these smarts (or if you already have an Alexa speaker), consider one of Ecobee's less expensive thermostats or Honeywell's $150 Lyric T5. Otherwise, I'd strongly suggest the Ecobee4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ecobee's been in the thermostat biz for a long time, but its first few smart models weren't quite able match the appeal of Nest's stylish Learning Thermostat. Flash forward six years and Nest still sells the same ol' thermostat for the same $249 price. During this time, Ecobee has forged ahead with a lineup of three connected thermostats: the $169 Ecobee3 Lite, the $199 Ecobee3 -- and the new Ecobee4.  The Ecobee4's design still can't match Nest's gorgeous iPod-inspired thermostat, but it dominates in every other category. Its touchscreen display is easy to use and fast to respond. Instead of Nest's predictive algorithm, the Ecobee4 relies on a remote sensor. Complete with temperature and motion/proximity detection, the sensor makes it easier to determine if someone's home or away. It's also a nice accessory for tracking rooms with hot or cold spots. I installed the sensor for our review unit at the CNET Smart Home in a basement bourbon storage room to monitor temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Power Extender Kit (PEK) comes with your Ecobee4 purchase, too. Since this thermostat requires a C-wire to operate, you can use the PEK to add in the extra wire's functionality without rewiring your entire HVAC system. Want to know more about C-wires? Check out this article. Always consult a professional installer if you have questions about your thermostat's configuration. But if you're familiar with electrical wiring and you don't need to use the PEK, the installation should take less than 30 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Connecting your Ecobee4 to Wi-Fi is as easy as downloading the related app for Android and iPhone and following the step-by-step instructions. It should only take a few minutes. Once the thermostat is connected to your local network, you can access it from the mobile or web app. You have access to the same features in both apps, but the web app's home screen provides a better overview at a glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ecobee4 also works with a lot of smart home partners. Nest's count? Three -- Amazon Alexa, IFTTT and Wink. Ecobee works with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Samsung SmartThings and IFTTT. And, instead of simply integrating with an Amazon Echo, Echo Dot or Tap speaker, the Ecobee4 doubles as an Alexa speaker. Just as you would with a standalone device, you can ask Alexa to tell you a joke, to turn on your Haiku fan or to adjust your thermostat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding smart home integrations takes a little longer than the initial configuration, but it's still very straightforward. I linked the Ecobee4 to HomeKit's Home app in iOS 10, as well as to a shared Amazon account. From here, I was able to control the thermostat with Siri via HomeKit and with Alexa directly from the thermostat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything I tried worked well. Adjusting the thermostat at the source, with the mobile or web app -- and with Siri or Alexa voice control -- was all consistent. Adding an Alexa speaker to the thermostat also provided an additional layer of smarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ecobee4 became a central hub in the home, a place where I'd ask Alexa for the daily forecast, turn Alexa-enabled lighting on and off and more. One limitation: the Ecobee4 doesn't have Amazon's Echo Spatial Perception (ESP) feature, so it will respond to your command even if other Alexa speakers are nearby. Also, a built-in Alexa speaker might not make sense if your thermostat is located in a remote hallway, but it's a very useful integration otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "By DIY standards, Ecobee's $249 Ecobee4 Smart Thermostat is top-of-the-line. If you don't care about having multiple points of access between your thermostat and other smart home devices, this model might not be worth the price. But consider this: Nest's Learning Thermostat also retails for $249, but offers fewer smart home partners and related accessories. It also doesn't have an integrated Alexa speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ecobee has shifted the paradigm with the Ecobee4, making it the best smart thermostat available today and an Editor's Choice Award winner. Get it for its cool tech, keep it for its reliable performance.\n",
      "Aura\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive Systems' Aura is a unique idea for a home security system: instead of cameras it uses a wireless signal to detect intruders. Better yet, it's super easy to setup and use, and it sends out timely alerts to your phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, it has a long list of shortcomings, like the small area of coverage and the lack of integration with other devices such as smart locks. What is a deal-breaker, however, is the price. At $500, it's just too expensive for what it offers, as well as the demographic its performance suits best, namely those who live in small homes or apartments. If you're serious enough about home security to spend that much, or if you have a medium or larger home, check out one of these alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Aura system comes with two pieces of hardware, a  hub that's about the size of a coffee mug and an even more compact palm-size plug-in sensor unit. When placed up to some 50 feet away from each other, the two link up using a proprietary 2.4GHz wireless signal -- similar to Wi-Fi -- to form an invisible, elliptical zone of motion detection. When a person or object enters this sphere the disruption to the signal will trigger an alert to your phone  motions will be detected, alerts will be sent to the owner's phone and -- if enabled -- the hub's built-in alarm will sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, the system will tell you if something is moving inside your home, for how long and the intensity of their movements. It also retains the log of detected events with graphs, similar to a quake detector.  Keep in mind that since this is a wireless system, it can be susceptible to jamming devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easy setup: The setup of the Aura is like that of a Wi-Fi system. You download the Aura mobile app, sign up for an account and then follow through with the onscreen instructions. The whole process took me less than 10 minutes. To put this in perspective, it took me half an hour to mount just one security camera alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of this ease of use is the fact that, unlike camera-based systems, you won't need to look for any particular place to place the Aura's hardware units and there's no mounting involved. Basically you just need to connect the hub to your home's Wi-Fi network, place it at one end of the area that needs to be monitored and then plug the sensor unit into a wall socket at the other end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easy and fun to use: As long as your home is connected to the internet, the system is easy to use and you will get a notice via the app in almost real time (there's a delay of a few seconds). You can also view a detailed log of what happened in the previous seven days using the mobile app or its web portal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owner of the system can also add more users by inviting them via email. These users can then download the Aura mobile app, login and also monitor the system as well as get identified by the system itself via what Cognitive Systems describes as \"geofencing.\" Basically, when you login with using the mobile app, the process registers the phone you used with the system. When a registered phone enters the protected sphere, the system will recognize it and behave accordingly, such as automatically disarming or sending an alert that an user has come home etc. Similarly, when the user leaves the sphere, the system will record the departure and can automatically arm itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another cool thing is, similar to SimpliSafe, a competing home-security system, the Aura doesn't require line of sight to work. This means the two units can monitor a fixed area with multiple rooms, on multiple floors, that would otherwise requires multiple cameras cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long battery life: Each unit of the system has a built-in battery that lasts a long time. In my testing, after working unplugged over night, the hub still had some 5 percent battery life left. Generally you can expect the Aura to work through a four or five hours of power outage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limited coverage: The size of the protected area depends on the distance between the two units, the longer the distance, the larger the coverage area. In testing in open space the best distance I found is about 50 feet. Further out, up to some 100 feet, the system might still work but its detection rates are no longer reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, obstacles, like walls or large objects, greatly reduce how far you can place the Aura's hardware units from each other. Cognitive Systems suggests that there should be no more than three walls in between the two units. In my trial, the Aura could hardly cover a home of merely 1,500 square feet. Generally, when there are walls, you can't leave the two units more than 30 feet away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also keep in mind that the two units can only monitor the area in between them. That means if somebody comes in from  behind either of the unit, their motions won't be detected. And since no home has the shape of an ellipse, there will always be part of the house that's not monitored. For example, it's very hard, if not impossible, to have the Aura monitor the outside your home, such as the driveway, or to detect if somebody opens the front door or a particular window.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Cognitive Systems, for now, the Aura doesn't support extra sensors so if you have a large house, there's no way you can make the system monitor the entire home. This is one of the chief drawbacks of the system, and what makes its high price tag hard to stomach. Most other security hardware, from cameras, to whole home, sensor-based systems, cost between $100 and $300.\n",
      "\n",
      "No smart-home integration or customizable filter for small objects, quiet alarm: The Aura also doesn't work with any existing home automation devices. You won't be able to connect it with locks, lights, or other smart-home devices over Z-Wave, ZigBee, or or even Wi-Fi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive Systems says that the \"Aura works with IFTTT to connect to other smart-home products,\" and it's working on getting partnerships and that's the future. For now, the Aura only functions as a standalone security system and that means its hub's built-in alarm is the only deterrent mechanism. Unfortunately this single-volume alarm is rather quiet. At just 73db, it's not loud enough for anyone from outside the house to hear, making it more of an annoyance (when unintentionally triggered) than being effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's more, the system doesn't let you customize the size of objects that would trigger the alarm. In my testing, my playful 15-pound poodle mix tripped the sensors all the time. Cognitive Systems told me that it will update the system's firmware to auto-adjust its sensitiveness according to the environment in a near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy risk: You need to provide a home address to register an account with Cognitive Systems before you can use the Aura, which will be used for its geofencing feature. And to work well, both the system and the Aura mobile app need to connect to Cognitive Systems at all times. All of these issues amount to a privacy risk, if your information is ever compromised and could renders the system useless when there's no internet. It can even produce inaccurate triggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take the geofencing feature mentioned above for example. It's not based on the Aura's real-time location but rather on your phone's location which presumably Cognitive Systems keeps track of. In other words, if you set up the Aura at one location, then move it to another location, such another home address, the old location will still be used as \"home\" and still trigger geofencing events, until you update it with a new address.\n",
      "\n",
      "This also means that once you've signed in with the Aura mobile app and allows the app to access your smartphone's location service, Cognitive Systems can know your whereabouts at all times. Cognitive Systems told me that it only \"looks for the phone to enter the proximity of the address associated with their Hub\" and doesn't track where an user goes.  The Aura app does have the option to turn off motions and member data when the system is disarmed. By default this option is turned on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing about the Aura system is the ease of use, but the system fails on value, and more importantly, effectiveness, which is the most important thing in home security. If you have a small guest house or a separate Airbnb apartment that you want to keep tabs on, the system will get the job done. But if you live in a residential home, and not even a big one, chances are the Aura won't cut it. That make it impossible for me to recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the technology behind Aura's design is promising, and at least according to its statements, Cognitive Systems sounds committed to improving it. Keep this one on your radar if it sounds interesting, but I'd think twice about buying it right now. If you have an immediate need for security system check out one of these.\n",
      "Nomiku Sous Chef\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A veteran sous-vide machine maker wants to make a hands-off cooking method even easier. Nomiku will add meal delivery and a scan-to-cook feature to the third generation of its $149 Wi-Fi-enabled sous-vide immersion circulator for automated water bath cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nomiku's new cooker can read Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags on frozen, packaged food that the company will send to you as part of the Nomiku Sous Chef Meal program. The tags contain information about how long and at what water temperature your food needs to cook. You attach the immersion circulator to a large container of water and wave the package in front of the device. It will read the RFID tag and automatically start heating the water according to the information in the tag, so all you have to do is drop the food into the container.\n",
      "\n",
      "One hundred customers will test the the Nomiku Sous Chef Meal program starting in May. Lisa Q. Fetterman, Nomiku's co-founder and CEO, says the company will work to extend the program to the rest of the US after its first month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nomiku Sous Chef Meal program could appeal to a busy home cook who doesn't have the time to prep a meal for a water bath, or the cook who doesn't quite know how. But Nomiku will have to prove that its meals are as good as or better than what you can make at home, and that it's worth the cost: Main courses will cost $8 to $14, and side dishes will cost $4 to $6. (Once you buy $300 worth of meals, you'll get a $149 food credit in return.) Nomiku recommends one main course and two sides per person, so a dinner for two could cost between $32 and $52.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nomiku was one of the first companies to introduce a sous-vide immersion circulator for home use with its successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in 2012. Sous vide is a relatively new method of cooking in which you vacuum-seal food in plastic bags and cook it in a water bath. Immersion circulators like the Nomiku regulate the temperature of the water so your food cooks evenly. Restaurants and caterers have used the technique for decades now, but more home cooks gained access to sous vide when relatively low-cost immersion circulators like Nomiku became available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Nomiku's debut, the sous-vide competition has gotten pretty stiff. Manufacturers like Anova Culinary and ChefSteps began to make their own immersion circulators, some of which were less expensive than the original Nomiku. And a delay in the release of the WiFi Nomiku gave other companies the chance to add Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity faster so home cooks could control their devices from their phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The addition of scanning and meal delivery -- two firsts for mainstream sous vide --  could help Nomiku separate itself from its competitors. And the RFID scanning for automated cooking is right in line with the increasing amount of automation we've seen in small kitchen appliances. For example, meal delivery is part of the appeal of the yet-to-be-released Tovala countertop oven, which will read the RFID tags on packaged meals and cook them accordingly. And the June Intelligent Oven uses facial recognition technology to identify food you put in the appliance and cook it automatically. All of these appliances want to remove the guesswork from cooking for ambitious, tech-minded home cooks.\n",

      "Hyperikon 60W Equivalent LED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people buy their light bulbs at a hardware store, or maybe in the housewares aisle at their local grocery, but there's a growing number of LED options available online. That includes a line of LED light bulbs from Hyperikon, an up-and-coming lighting manufacturer based out of California. The price for a single, dimmable 60W replacement LED? $8 on Amazon, or $7 direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyperikon pitches its bulb as an easy efficiency upgrade over a 60W incandescent, and at just 9 watts, it certainly fits the bill. On top of that, it offers strong dimming performance and above average color-rendering capabilities, which means that it'll help the colors in your home look a little more vivid. That last bit gives Hyperikon a slight edge over alternatives that cost a little less per bulb, and makes this light a worthy option if you're looking for a color rendering bump.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Hyperikon's LED doesn't come with any real weak spots, it didn't ace all of my tests, either. With 750 lumens to its name, its brightness fell slightly short of the 820 lumens printed on the box, though not enough so to make for a noticeably dimmer light bulb. With a power draw of 9 watts, it's putting out 83 lumens per watt -- that's good but not groundbreaking, and not quite as efficient as a competing Sylvania Ultra LED that's about twice s affordable as Hyperikon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, this bulb gets all of the important stuff right. Replace a burnt-out incandescent with the Hyperikon LED and you'll knock about six bucks off of your yearly energy bill, all without compromising on things like light quality or dimmability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of dimmability, the Hyperikon LED promises to dim smoothly between 10 and 100 percent brightness on most modern dimming hardware. I tested it out on a number of switches and came away impressed. On modern switches, the bulb consistently dimmed down to about 8 percent at minimum while staying above 90 percent at maximum, which is a very good dimmable range.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than the numbers, I was impressed with the bulb's consistency, at least on modern dimming hardware. Switch for switch, the Hyperikon LED always dimmed as expected, hitting that same approximate dimmable rage and doing so without buzzing or flickering. However, things were less impressive with older dimming hardware. Though the dimmable range stayed solid, I definitely noticed some flicker when I tested the bulb out on an old rotary dial not intended for LEDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulb's real strength -- the one that sets it apart from a majority of LEDs on the market today -- is its color rendering score. Hyperikon pegs it at 95 out of 100, which would make it noticeably better than the average LED at producing clean whites and vivid colors. My tests bore that claim out -- though to my eye, Hyperikon isn't quite as good as the GE Reveal LED at boosting red tones. Still, it's an impressive result, especially considering that the Hyperikon LED is much brighter and more more efficient than that GE Reveal LED.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing I look for in my tests is how well each bulb handles heat. When you turn an LED light bulb on, it'll typically be slightly brighter than advertised. Then, as the bulb heats up, that brightness will slowly fall. After about thirty minutes, the bulb's heat sinks should kick in and stabilize things. It's too subtle to notice with the naked eye, but it's still a good indication of how well the bulb is designed -- and something to keep in mind if you're looking for a bulb to use in an enclosed fixture, where heat gets trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hyperikon did OK here, finishing my 90-minute test about 15 percent less bright than it started -- basically par for the course when it comes to LEDs. Bulbs from Feit and Cree did better here, losing only about 10 percent of that initial brightness, while the \"HD Light\" versions of both the GE Relax and GE Reveal LED did worse, each losing over twenty percent of their initial brightness readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, Hyperikon looks to have a pretty good bulb here -- and both the above average 45,000-hour lifespan and the very strong five-year warranty sweeten the deal still. You don't need to look any further than your local lighting aisle to find a good LED, but if you decide to look online, keep Hyperikon on your radar.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring's $249 (£195, AU$330 converted) Floodlight Cam is a definite improvement over your typical outdoor security light. In addition to being equipped with two LEDs, this Wi-Fi device also comes with an integrated 1080p HD security camera. Sign up for motion alerts in the related Ring app, where you can also set activity zones, create schedules and control the built-in 110-decibel siren. Starting at $3 per month, you can view saved video history on a contract-free basis.\n",

      "There's clearly a lot of functionality packed into this thing, but I can't give it full marks for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "While these limitations make Ring's clever floodlight-security camera hybrid slightly less recommendable, it's still well worth your consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear's Arlo was one of the first products to popularize modern, DIY outdoor home security. Since then, plenty of other manufacturers have followed suit with related devices like the Nest Cam Outdoor and the Canary Flex. Weatherproof security cameras integrated into outdoor lighting is one subcategory that has developed slowly, but is now becoming an industry trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a look at the Ring Floodlight Cam's specs versus its main competition:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring's Floodlight Cam costs more than Kuna and Toucan, but less than Netatmo's Welcome. At the same time, the Floodlight Cam has 1080p HD video resolution compared to Kuna and Toucan's 720p HD. The Floodlight Cam's $3 per month cloud storage fee is also less than Kuna and Toucan's. The Welcome camera, on the other hand, has internal local storage so you don't have to worry about a monthly expense at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring Floodlight Cam tacks on some additional features like activity zones and night vision (which Kuna and Toucan don't offer). Ring also promises to add Floodlight Cam support for IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings, Wink and even Apple HomeKit soon. (A Ring representative told me Floodlight Cam's are already outfitted with the Apple MFi chips needed for HomeKit, it's just a matter of activating them.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Floodlight Cam comes equipped with two 1,500-lumen LEDs, which are each roughly equivalent to a 100W incandescent bulb. That isn't incredibly bright, particularly if you install it high on your roofline like a typical floodlight. Of course, you can also install it lower so it doubles as a porch light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring's Floodlight Cam is a fairly simple DIY installation, but it's a hardwired device. If you have any reservations about setting up a product that requires electrical wiring, hire someone to handle it for you. I enlisted one of CNET's technical gurus, Steve Conaway, to install the Floodlight Cam.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took Steve about 30 minutes from start to finish, but we ran into an unexpected setback along the way. The width of the Floodlight Cam's baseplate didn't match up with the width of the standard-sized electrical box at the CNET Smart Home. So, we currently have just one screw holding up the whole thing. That workaround has worked surprisingly well for us during testing, but it wouldn't be ideal for a more long-term installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the Floodlight Cam's installed, download the app and add your local Wi-Fi info to get it online; this should take roughly 5 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you're ready to opt-in to motion alerts, create activity zones and more. One important thing to note is that you have to create activity zones before you receive any motion alerts, even if you've already enabled motion alerts. Once I figured that out, everything worked well. I received prompt alerts tied to motion outside. You can adjust the sensitivity of the sensor, too, if you're getting too many notifications of your neighbor's cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The live feed was clear in day and night mode and it was easy to set motion and lighting schedules in the app. The main limitation of this device will likely be your Wi-Fi connection. Out here in the Kentucky countryside, the Wi-Fi is hit-and-miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "During testing, the area around the Floodlight Cam typically averaged 10 mbps for download speed and 1 mbps (or slightly less) for upload speed. The Ring app says anything above 1 mbps for download and upload is good, but this Ring support page says at least 2 mbps is best. Because of this, we experienced some lag times, pixelated video feeds and a two-way talk intercom that occasionally cut in and out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring's $249 Floodlight Cam goes a long way toward helping you keep an eye on the perimeter of your home. At the same time, I really wish it offered free cloud storage as an entry-level option. I also wish Ring had introduced smart home integrations at launch rather than making us wait. Even so, you should consider adding Ring's LED floodlight and HD camera to your outdoor security setup. It's only going to get smarter with time.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The smart button market is small, but competitive.

      "The education component of the Hestan Cue is the star of the product. Videos are included with each step of a recipe, so you can see exactly what you're supposed to do. And there are many delicious dishes from which to choose, whether it's sauces or salmon or pancakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not as impressive without its app. For example, the Hestan Cue regulates the surface temperature of the pan well, but steaks with uneven thickness gave it problems that resulted in uneven cooking. And like I've seen with other cooking systems, there's no easy way to adapt recipes. You're stuck with the ingredients and steps Hestan gives you. Fortunately, the recipes I tried were very good, but it would be nice to build my own recipes or replace ingredients in existing ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hestan Cue, which is available online and at Williams Sonoma, would be a great addition to the kitchen of a home cook with \"Top Chef\" aspirations. It will keep you from burning an important dish and teach you a thing or two in the process. But $650 is a lot of money for two pieces of hardware. If you need some help in the kitchen but don't have the cash, buy a decent pan and a food thermometer and watch some old episodes of \"Good Eats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hestan Cue is like a combination of the Pantelligent smart frying pan and the FirstBuild Paragon Induction Cooktop ($199.00 at Amazon.com). Didn't read those reviews? Let me break it down for you: The pan contains a \"smart capsule\" in its handle that is equipped with Bluetooth, as is the induction cooktop. You download the iOS or Android app and select a recipe. The app connects to the cooktop and walks you step by step through what you need to do. The app tells the burner what temperature is required for each stage of cooking. At the same time, the burner is keeping track of the temperature on the pan's surface, so if it's getting too hot, the burner will automatically lower its temperature or vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 11-inch wide pan looks similar to other stainless steel cookware you might see in a store, but with some notable differences. You can't put the pan in the dishwasher or the oven, and the company advises against using it on a cooktop other than the Hestan Cue induction burner. Fortunately, the pan is easy to clean, and the recipes in the app don't require additional steps in the oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hestan Cue induction burner is 12.5 inches wide and weighs 5 pounds. Similar to the FirstBuild Paragon cooktop, it's hard to store, so you'd have to make a permanent place for the Cue on your countertop. You can control the burner manually through the app by setting a specific temperature or a more general cooking level. You can also adjust the cooking level on the unit itself. If manual cooking isn't your thing, just select a recipe and the Cue will take care of the temperature for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hestan Cue's app provides a wonderful way to try new recipes and learn how to perform cooking tasks. This is accomplished through videos that the app shows with each step of a recipe. For example, if you select the boneless pork chop with sweet apple and onion sauce recipe, there are videos that show a chef zesting a lemon, chopping garlic, slicing onion and julienning an apple and carrying out every other part of the recipe. This is a handy tool if you're rusty on your technical cooking skills or just want to make sure you can properly dice a potato.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app's recipes range from basic (bacon, grilled cheese sandwiches) to the more refined (trout amandine, dill and caviar emulsion). The app recipes I tried came out well, but I noticed many of the protein main dishes relied on the addition of a sauce to really heighten the flavor. For example, the boneless pork chop I cooked tasted fine, but it was the accompanying bacon-bourbon glaze that really made the dish sing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hestan Cue also had problems with even cooking, despite its responsive temperature control. Let's take a look at one of the steaks I cooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the steak was of an uneven thickness, its doneness varied from medium to well done throughout the same cut of meat. You get better results with a method like sous vide, in which food items cook more evenly thanks to a circulating, temperature-controlled water bath that cooks the food through a plastic bag in which it's encased. The steak showed that even a $650 smart skillet and burner has the same problem as a normal pan and cooktop.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you trust yourself more than the app, you can control the temperature and power level yourself. The burner responds very quickly when you put your desired temperature into the app. However, I wish the app provided basic temperature guides for common dishes if you'd like to cook on your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hestan Cue cooking system delivers on its promise to teach you how to cook and is at its best when you select recipes from the app. This Bluetooth-connected pan and single burner are responsive to one another to keep dishes at the proper temperature. But don't turn to it for simple recipes -- this is a system for a home cook who cares about garnishes, emulsions and other next-level cooking steps. Unfortunately, the $650 cost is still too high to get the Hestan Cue onto the countertops of many folks who could benefit from this system.\n",
      "LookOut Charger\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, Toronto-based startup Lookout's Lookout Charger is just that -- a typical USB phone charger. But this unassuming device actually has a high-definition security camera hidden inside. Not only is the charger designed to capture footage of intruders discreetly, Lookout also markets its covert camera as a way to spy on mischievous teenagers and cheating spouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the right is a quick overview of the Lookout Charger's specs, straight from its Indiegogo campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charger's built-in storage, 1080p HD resolution and US and international adapter prongs all give it a surprisingly robust set of hardware specs.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the Lookout Charger might be a little too simple. It doesn't come with a related app, there's no live-streaming functionality and it doesn't work with any smart-home platforms. Instead, the camera records when it's plugged in and you can connect it to your laptop or computer via a USB adapter to view the saved footage later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not convinced a charger would provide a good vantage point for a camera, since a lot of outlets are located way below eye-level. Regardless, you'll definitely have to get creative about where you install this thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lookout Charger is just finishing up its Indiegogo campaign with nearly $100,000 raised so far. Its early bird price tiers are sold out, but models are still available starting at $75 (£60 or AU$100 converted). Units are available to ship internationally and are slated to reach backers in July 2017.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on where you live, water conservation is a major concern come summer. Everyone wants a beautiful yard and garden, but watering them can cost -- and it's not always as environmentally friendly as we hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a class of gadgets that control irrigation systems has grown over the past few years, helping users water judiciously, per the weather conditions of the day. The latest device to do so is called Sprinkl Conserve, and it stands out from the pack because of its relatively low $100 price tag (around half the cost of many competitors). Right now, despite some sacrifices to its feature set, the Conserve seems like a welcome entry to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conserve works pretty simply. You attach it to your irrigation system control panel, then connect to it via a phone app. From there, the Conserve adds a few smart features: remote control, weather tracking and responsiveness, and mobile scheduling.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means you can control and schedule the sprinklers with your phone while away from home, and set the device to automatically stop watering if it will rain on a given day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sprinkl's device has three big competitors: the Rachio, the GreenIQ and the Blossom. All three of these devices cost between $180 and $250, letting Sprinkl establish a new, competitive price point. Of course, all three also include major features that the Conserve doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, each of them allows users to toggle individual zones of control, whereas Sprinkl only lets users toggle the whole irrigation system on or off. Likewise, competitors work with voice assistants and smart-home integration systems like Alexa and IFTTT, whereas Sprinkl's Conserve doesn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes sense, given the features, how Sprinkl's new gadget keeps its price so much lower than competitors, and that distinction adds welcome diversity to a small market. All that remains to be seen is how well it actually works.\n",
      "Cambridge Sound Management Nightingale\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find white-noise machines on Amazon for 30 bucks, so why should you spend $300 on Cambridge Sound Management's Nightingale sleep system? Here's a quick rundown:\n",
      "\n",
      "Good -- Your purchase includes two speaker-equipped smart plugs -- install them on opposite sides of the room for a surround sound effect. Nightingale is highly customizable, even for snorers or for folks with tinnitus. You can set a recurring sound schedule and it works with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not-so-good -- It's expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get Nightingale if you're truly interested in advanced levels of sleep machine customization. For everyone else, a more affordable product will probably do the trick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nightingale is literally just two smart plugs outfitted with color-changing night-light LEDs and speakers. They connect to the related iPhone app over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (there's currently no Android support). Install them on opposite sides of your room facing each other to create an immersive stereo effect Cambridge Sound Management refers to as \"sound blankets.\" Because Nightingale is a smart plug, you still have full access to your outlet for lamps, alarm clocks and other electronic devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open the Nightingale iPhone app and it will immediately begin to walk you through the brief configuration process. Make sure your Nightingale is plugged in, select \"Find Devices,\" add your Wi-Fi details or connect over Bluetooth and create an account with your email address and a password.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, you can begin to customize your account. Select among various room types or conditions, such as \"Adult Bedroom,\" \"Youth Bedroom,\" and \"Tinnitus Condition.\" Then you can determine if your room is absorptive, neutral or reflective.\n",
      "\n",
      "An absorptive room is carpeted, with drapes and upholstered furniture, whereas a reflective room has hardwood floors, glass surfaces and minimal upholstery. A neutral room has a mix of both. All of these things help determine what sound Nightingale selects for you. The final step is to create a schedule that will turn your Nightingale on/off automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "This entire process should take just a few minutes. While the app is mostly well designed, there's a slight learning curve in terms of locating specific settings and features. They're scattered on various screens through the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nightingale helps you select a white-noise \"sound blanket,\" but you can always change things up if you don't like it for some reason. I learned that I'm not a huge fan of white noise in general. Over the week I tested Nightingale, I switched among all of the options to see if one seemed more calming to no avail. Even so, I can confirm that the two-plug kit is way more immersive than a single-device white-noise machine that only travels from one direction outward. Nightingale successfully canceled out most sounds from the busy-ish road near my house. (You can always adjust the volume to help customize this, too.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the white noise didn't quite do the trick, I switched over to Nightingale's assorted nature sounds -- \"Lakeshore,\" \"Crickets,\" \"Loons,\" \"Whale Songs\" and \"Rainstorm.\" Like the white-noise sounds, Nightingale's nature sounds literally sounded like I was in nature. In the case of \"Lakeshore,\" \"Crickets\" and \"Rainstorm\" that was a good thing. \"Loons\" and \"Whale Songs\" were a bit too intense for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also asked my parents to try out Nightingale for one night, since my dad has tinnitus. We went through the same configuration process at their house, except the app selected the custom \"Tinnitus Blanket\" for them to try. My dad said he slept roughly the same as any other night, but that his ears were ringing more when he woke up in the morning. This could have been due to a variety of factors, but it still wasn't a great result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nightingale also works with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT. The Alexa Skill is fairly sparse, but I was able to turn on various sounds, as well as turn Nightingale off with voice commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IFTTT integration was a bit more robust. I created an IFTTT rule that closed a window shade whenever the Nightingale nightlight turned on. You could create additional rules for all of the smart shades and lights in your home -- or even adjust your Nest thermostat's temperature based on Nightingale's status.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we've tested out the It smart mattress by Sleep Number and have comes across a number of other sleep-related devices, we haven't seen anything quite like Nightingale before. Sleep Number's It bed integrated with select health-and-fitness-related brands like Fitbit and MyFitnessPal, as well as Nest, but it doesn't currently support any voice control integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $300 Nightingale by Cambridge Sound Management is definitely more immersive than a one-directional white-noise machine. For folks seeking that stereo effect, as well as advanced customization, Nightingale could be a good fit. At the same time, snorers or people with tinnitus shouldn't expect this sleep system to be a cure-all. And, Android customers are completely out of luck (for now, at least).\n",
      "Singlecue Gen 2\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Voice control is cool, but the future of toggling complex systems of devices -- like your home theater or smart home setup -- is with gestures. At least, that's what the developers behind the $150 Singlecue would have you believe. If this device sounds familiar, it's because we looked at it a few years back -- but this is generation two, with a greater focus on overall smart home control.\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out, controlling your TV, streaming device, and smart home gadgets with gestures actually feels pretty cool (even if you look ridiculous to everyone else). Singlecue tracks your movements well, but its clunky menu system and lack of customizability seriously hurt its appeal. For now, you'll want to wait till generation three or four to invest in the Singlecue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how the Singlecue works: you set it up by your TV, then using the app, integrate it with devices around your house. I set it up with Alexa, a Vizio TV, an Apple TV streaming device and Philips Hue lights. It also works with a slew of other devices, including Roku, Bose, and Nest devices (you can check out the full list here). After the setup, it tracks your gestures with a camera, and lets you navigate the menus displayed on its screen (which is about 1.5 inches by 2.5 inches).\n",
      "\n",
      "I was skeptical of the gesture control at first, but it works relatively well, causing only occasional moments of frustration. And when it works -- which is the vast majority of the time -- controlling your lights and TV with gestures actually feels pretty damn cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other big addition the Gen 2 Singlecue introduces is Alexa integration. That means people can turn on their TVs with voice commands to their Echo device like, \"Alexa, tell Singlecue to turn on the TV.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is, other gadgets like Logitech's $99 Harmony Hub, already allow this kind of control. Plus, with those devices, you can set up particular command chains, so when you say, \"Alexa, turn on Netflix,\" it will power up your TV, Apple TV and sound bar -- and it will start the Netflix app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until Singlecue adds more customizable commands, with gestures and voice control, it won't be quite as easy to use as other gadgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disappointingly, even when your TV is already on, and you're sitting in front of it, the Singlecue isn't the most practical remote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first problem is, while the Singlecue does have a couple direct-control motions like putting your finger over your lips to mute the TV, or holding up your hand to pause it, mostly you use gestures to navigate its menu -- which is displayed on the small screen on the device. If you want to turn off your lights, for example, instead of mapping a particular motion to that command, you have to use the preset gestures to cycle through the menus to reach your light, then to select its \"off\" function. After a while, the gestures that are supposed to feel natural begin to feel instead like an extra barrier to controlling your devices efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, you have to be seated in the same spot every time you use Singlecue. That means you don't have the same control if you're on the side of the couch, or just lounging. While most people do have a particular spot they sit on the couch, this is a major impediment to casual use of the Singlecue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the Singlecue's screen is relatively small -- so people with any visual impairments could have serious problems using it -- and it requires your attention as much as the TV you're often trying to control. Singlecue doesn't need to superimpose some graphic on the TV screen itself to solve this problem. It just needs to make the gestures intuitive enough that users don't need to constantly look at the tiny screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised that the biggest problem with Singlecue wasn't its innovative gesture tracking, but rather a convoluted menu system and lack of customizable commands. In other words, the device nails the tough part, and totally whiffs the easier part. Developers behind the device say more customization is on the way, but for now, you have to work with the present menus and gestures.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a solid universal remote, the second gen Singlecue won't be your best bet. But maybe by generation three or four, it will be.\n",
      "Abode Starter Kit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The $300 Abode Starter Kit is an excellent entry-point into DIY home security. It really has everything -- a Z-Wave and ZigBee hub with a built-in siren, two door/window sensors, a battery-powered security camera and motion detector, and a key fob for remote arming and disarming. (Abode isn't currently sold internationally, but the Starter Kit converts to roughly £240 and AU$390 at the current exchange rate).\n",
      "\n",
      "Abode also sells a variety of other hardware accessories you can add to the system at any time, as well as a range of optional professional monitoring services. Factor in its support for over two dozen Z-Wave and ZigBee devices, integration with Alexa, IFTTT and Nest, and you have a smart system that's easy to recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting up Abode's starter kit begins with the related app. Download the Android or iOS software and follow the instructions to pair all of the accessories. Each piece of wall-, door- or window-mounted hardware comes with an adhesive backing for easy installation. You can remove it from a surface with relative ease, but you won't want to do this often -- I accidentally stripped off some paint when we pulled the battery-powered camera/motion detector from a doorframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a quick overview of each accessory included in the starter kit:\n",
      "\n",
      "Abode also sent us a live-streaming camera to test alongside the starter kit. This camera is available as an optional accessory for an additional $149.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a look at Abode's specs versus some of its competition:\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of things stand out here. Abode's system is more expensive up front, but unlike Scout and Simplisafe, there aren't any required monthly fees. Abode also offers more smart-home integrations than its fee-free counterpart, iSmartAlarm. Its starter pack also comes with a camera -- a unique feature that none of the other starter packs offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have four main monitoring options with Abode:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hub -- Connects to your Wi-Fi router via an included Ethernet cable and power adapter. It works with select Z-Wave and ZigBee devices, has a 93-decibel siren and a 12-hour backup battery. See the complete list of compatible Z-Wave and ZigBee devices here.Door/window sensors -- Attach to a door, window, cabinet or anything else to track opening and closing.Security camera and motion detector -- This 90-degree battery-powered camera doesn't offer live streaming, but it will take three images when the system is armed and it detects motion. Key fob - Stick it on your keychain to arm and disarm your system remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "One annoying thing is that you have to create rules and other custom automations in Abode's web app. I wish you could also do that from your phone. I do like having web access, though, so you can pull up a larger screen with all of the details clearly displayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abode worked very well throughout testing. Whether I was using an Amazon Alexa device, the key fob or the app, arming and disarming was responsive. I also created an IFTTT rule that turned on the interior entryway lights (via IFTTT-compatible Lutron switches) every time I opened the front door. Again, it worked great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also received prompt notifications and emails, alerting me to status changes (switching to Home mode from Away mode, for instance). The system's auto-arm and -disarm function, which is tied to the location of your phone, also worked as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it wasn't already clear, Abode's $300 starter kit is a great DIY option. It makes particular sense if you have more ground to cover than an all-in-one system like the Piper NV or the LG Smart Security Wireless Camera can handle, but you aren't sold on a massive, contract-based system.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, if you decide later on that you want to add more devices, you can -- either from Abode's own cache of temperature sensors, flood detectors and cameras or from its list of approved Z-Wave and ZigBee devices. The fact that Abode doesn't force you into a monthly fee and works with Alexa, IFTTT and Nest is pretty great, too. Take a close look at this system if you're considering a flexible DIY security setup for your home.\n",

      "Geeni Energi\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Connected plugs are one of the best entry points for the smart home market. They offer convenience for a relatively small commitment while adding voice control, remote access, scheduling and energy monitoring to otherwise dumb devices. But a $35 entry point -- the price of the up-till-now best affordable plug -- still feels a little expensive and the cost quickly adds up when you expand your setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter the Geeni Energi, a smart plug that doesn't break new ground with its hardware or software, but does hit an affordable new price: $25. The Geeni Energi doesn't have the flashy design or features of industry leaders, or the integrations of the best competitors. But it establishes itself as one of the best affordable entry points to smart home tech -- which is exactly what a smart plug should do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Geeni doesn't make a great first impression. It looks almost exactly like the original Belkin WeMo Switch -- which is over five years old -- just flipped upside-down. Its bulky design blocks the outlet beneath it, and when I was starting my account, one of the setup directions popped up in a different language.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, the Energi comes across as a little janky at first. But it turns out, Geeni's product is pretty reliable. The scheduling and remote control features work well, and the energy monitoring adds a nice bit of smarts that many more affordable plugs forgo. Even the app, once the device is set up, is simple and easy to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its low price, the Energi boasts an integration with Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) and Geeni says Google Home ($129.00 at Dell Home) voice control is on the way.  While I'm disappointed by the lack of an IFTTT channel, which really expands the use-cases for other smart plugs, Geeni says that's next on their roadmap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Geeni Energi's features won't blow away competitors, but this smart plug is nipping at the heels of devices like the Belkin WeMo Mini at a significantly lower price. Compare it to pricier gadgets like the iDevices Switch ($26.50 at Amazon.com) and Belkin WeMo Insight Switch ($34.97 at Amazon.com) (both selling for around $50 now), and those devices start to look pretty unappealing, despite their sleeker designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Energi is a solid deal right now. As soon as Geeni adds Google Home and IFTTT integration, it'll be one of the top devices on the market at a lower price than many competitors. Here's hoping the updates come soon, and the next model has a design that looks a little less 2012.\n",
      "BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera Station\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The $300 BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera has a list of features that will impress even die-hard weather geeks. It offers the usual array of climate sensors found on weather systems popular among amateur meteorologists and science educators. It can detect temperature, wind speed, rain and air pressure, plus it draws its electrical power from the sun. What makes the BloomSky Sky2 truly unique are its HD camera, its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, its companion mobile app and the way it ties in with other smart home gadgets and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sky2 is expensive even if it's priced competitively against traditional options from weather station specialists Davis and Acurite. Buying a kit like this only really makes sense if it's in your job description or you have a serious weather fetish and money to burn. Ordinary people with merely a casual interest in local atmospheric conditions are better off consulting a mobile app or choosing a less expensive device such as the $179 Netatmo Weather Station. It doesn't have a camera or solar power, but the Netatmo is a snap to deploy, and monitors your home environment too.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a roundish body, the BloomSky Sky2 reminds me of giant eyeball that's bristling with sensors. About the size of your average grapefruit, this model replaces Bloom's older BloomSky Plus device but is physically identical on the outside. Just like the first Sky, the Sky2's most noticeable feature is a large camera on its face. The camera has a fisheye lense that lets it see a wide 170-degree field of vision. You can pivot the camera, which sits on a curved hinge, to point straight upward or angle it down about 30 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next to the Sky2's camera are instruments that sample relative humidity, ambient light, air pressure and temperature. Below the camera is the weather station's moisture detector. A field of copper circles of various sizes, the sensor detects the occurrence of rain but can't measure the amount of rainfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "For that you'll have to spend an additional $140 for BloomSky's Storm accessory, which features a tipping-cup rain collector. The Storm has hardware to measure both wind speed and wind direction, to,o plus UV light levels, which the Sky and Sky2 units can't track.\n",
      "\n",
      "The competing $180 Netatmo Weather Station can't detect UV light but it does support these features, though they're not bundled in the base kit. In fact in the case of Netatmo you'll have purchase separate ($80) Wind Gauge and ($100) Rain Gauge add-ons. Netatmo sells the mounting kit separately too for $25. Not so with the Sky2, which comes with its mounting equipment included. To sum up, that's $440 for the Sky2 and the Storm, and $385 for the complete set of Netatmo gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the BloomSky Sky2 and Storm sit atop custom plastic poles that double as stakes. You can either drive them into the ground or place the units inside steel mounting brackets that you fix to an outdoor surface. In my case mounting the Sky2 wasn't too difficult since BloomSky supplies the mounting bracket and screws. The Sky2's solar panel easily and securely attaches to this bracket as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately BloomSky doesn't provide the same sort of hardware with the Storm kit -- it costs $40 extra. That forced me to improvise with what I had on hand: a metal flowerbed, a deck guardrail, plastic twist ties and the two flexible \"U-Bolts\" in the Sky2 box.\n",
      "\n",
      "By comparison the compact, wireless Netatmo Weather Station is a breeze to set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally Netatmo's kit includes an indoor module built to log characteristics of the environment within the home. BloomSky initially bundled a similar gadget but has since killed the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BloomSky Sky2 Weather Camera Station connects to your home's Wi-Fi, which allows you access to its sensor info via a companion mobile app anywhere you enjoy a live wireless network. The app, available on iOS and Android, is limited to current weather conditions but it does project a basic five-day forecast. For a full data history, BloomSky hosts a dashboard website that automatically backs up all information the weather station collects. There you can download raw data in spreadsheet form, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course the Sky2's most striking feature is its HD camera (1,920x1,072 pixels). While not a true video capture device, the imaging system snaps a color photo every 5 minutes and then stitches them together into time-lapse videos. These videos span daylight hours and their length depends on whether the Sky2's optical sensor detects sunlight. One big disappointment though is the actual transmitted video resolution is SD quality (640x640 pixels). Hopefully in the future you'll be able to record at the camera's full HD resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like that BloomSky has created its own IFTTT channel, which enables the Sky2 to interact with popular smart home products and services. IFTTT is a free web-based automation service that often punches through the walled gardens many companies build to protect their interests and prevent cooperation among gadgets viewed as or sold by the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance ,I created an IFTTT applet that turned on my lights, one Lifx Color 1000 smart bulb in my case, when the Sky2 first detected rain. When blue skies return another applet turns the bulb off, triggered when the BloomSky Storm's UV sensor notices ultraviolet rays move from level \"1\" to level \"2\" (scale of 0 to 11).\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately at the moment there's no way BloomSky's offering can send push alerts if the wind gusts beyond a certain speed. Neither will it provide a heads-up when current rainfall is about to hit flash flood proportions. Anyone who has experienced unexpected water in the basement would appreciate that. The Sky2 and Storm can't detect lightning strikes either, a feature that many old-style personal weather stations offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another drawback is that the Sky2 is only designed to operate on 2.4GHz Wi-Fi wireless networks. If your home system uses a hybrid setup such as the Google Wifi, which constantly swaps between 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, you're out of luck. This latest Sky2 model though has a Bluetooth radio, which BloomSky says makes the initial setup through the mobile app smoother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Netatmo's weather gadget, the Sky2 links to a network of Sky and Sky2 systems already deployed at large. The bonus here is that these stations offer the added value of captured video and still images in real time. It's also interesting that while BloomSky only officially sells its devices in the US, judging from the map within the app, these weather cameras appear to have spread globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer really depends on how much of a weather junkie you happen to be or if your occupation benefits from keeping a constant eye on local conditions. I'll wager most people don't meet these criteria and would be satisfied by a simple mobile weather app such as those from Weather Underground, AccuWeather and others. They've become quite advanced over the years and now even provide hyperlocal forecasts based on crowdsourced info, data pulled from deployed personal weather stations or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who would love to monitor rainfall and temperatures within their backyard or garden but prefer not to deal with lots of complex parts and hardware to set up, the $180 Netatmo Weather Station is the right choice. When you factor in all its extra modules you will pay more for the Netatmo system's convenience. Of course for techie folks who really get a kick out of weather events, it's hard to top the BloomSky Sky2 Weather Station's unique combination of traditional measurement instruments, smart home integration and bird's-eye view.\n",
      "iDevices Wall Outlet\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For $100, you can swap out one of your home's outlets with the Wi-Fi-enabled iDevices Wall Outlet. Make that upgrade, and you'll be able to turn each of its two outlets on and off independently, or program them to turn on and off automatically using the iDevices app on your Android or iOS device. You can also sync the Wall Outlet up with Apple HomeKit or with Amazon's Alexa to turn each outlet on and off using voice commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, each outlet functions the same as one of iDevices' plug-in smart switches, right down to the fact that they'll track the energy usage of whatever you've got plugged in. The only difference, obviously, it that this is a hard-wired product -- it isn't anywhere near as flexible as the switch, which you can plug in anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, smartening up your outlets makes for a connected living space that's a lot more seamless than one that's littered with blocky plugs all over the place. And, to the Wall Outlet's credit, it performed flawlessly in my tests at the CNET Smart Home. With just three wires to connect (line, neutral and ground), installing it was a relative cinch, and the integrations with Siri and Alexa both worked as advertised (there's even a little fold-down flap on the front of the outlet with the Apple HomeKit pairing code printed on it -- a nice, thoughtful touch). Add in the energy-tracking feature, and there's really not much else that I wish this thing was capable of.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, I'll take it further: this is the best smart outlet you can buy right now. It works well, it's got a good slate of third-party integrations, it's easy to install, it doesn't need a hub and it's from an established name with a clear vision for the connected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, this thing is something of a niche product, and an expensive one at that. I can see the appeal for anyone who's ready to go all-in with smart home tech, but if you're a curious connected home beginner, then you're much better off just getting a plug-in smart switch to experiment with. The Belkin WeMo Mini, the iHome Smart Plug, and iDevices' own smart switch all cost less than half as much as the Wall Outlet -- I say start there and wait for prices to come down before worrying about your outlets.\n",
      "Roost Smart Water Leak and Freeze Detector\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The leak-detector market, ironically enough, is flooded with devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the gadgets have the same basic design -- two probes that set off an alarm when they're connected by water. So, it's tough for a new entry to rise above the rest, which makes it all the more surprising that one just did.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Roost Smart Water Leak and Freeze Detector costs $50 (that's about £40 or AU$65), placing it firmly in the middle of the leak detector price range. But the Roost's design surprised me by working better than most of the devices at the high end of the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Roost detector is feature rich, as far as flood sensors go. It has two probes, running parallel in a loop around the base of the device, to sense water. It also tracks humidity and temperature, graphing them so you can see trends over a 24-hour or seven-day period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coils on the bottom of the Roost extend its range, and they don't rest on the ground, like the otherwise-impressive Fibaro Flood Sensor. Since the coils are slightly suspended, the detector won't set off a false alarm when placed in a drip pan, or on a similarly conductive surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Roost's biggest feature is its Wi-Fi connection. Sensors without a Wi-Fi connection, such as SmartThings and Wink, require a smart hub, which is a barrier to entry for many people. The two best sensors that do connect directly to your phone via Wi-Fi are both solid products, but they're more expensive -- the D-Link costs $60, and the Honeywell clocks in at $80.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between an easy setup, a solid set of features, and Wi-Fi connection, the Roost seems like the best option on the market right now. But a few drawbacks keep it from total domination. First, it doesn't work with any major smart home platforms, such as Apple HomeKit or Google Home. This isn't the end of the world but it does mean you'll need to download another app, which is kind of annoying to keep on your phone for a passive monitoring device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second big drawback is that the Roost isn't waterproof. While the detector isn't a totally leaky bucket, it certainly lets water in through the alarm's top speaker holes. A few drops of water splashed on these holes while I was testing the Roost and the alarm kept going off for nearly an hour -- even after I'd removed it from the water. More worryingly, the Roost sensor won't survive being submerged. So it's a one-shot deal in the case of serious flooding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its weaknesses, the Roost's strong design and feature-rich interface -- all for a comparably low price -- make it one of the most appealing devices on the market. If you don't already own a smart home hub, then the Roost and the D-Link should be the top two contenders for your flood sensor of choice.\n",
      "Sense Home Energy Monitor\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Editors' note (September 28, 2017): Since publishing this review, Sense has identified 14 new devices: the HVAC, the oven, \"unnamed heat 1,\" the microwave, \"unnamed device 1,\" \"unnamed motor 3,\" \"unnamed device 2,\" \"unnamed heat 2,\" the ice maker, a light, \"unnamed heat 3,\" \"unnamed device 3,\" \"unnamed device 4\" and a refrigerator. I'll continue to provide updates as it learns more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $299 Sense Home Energy Monitor (£240 and AU$390 at the current exchange rate) is supposed to bridge the gap between your utility-issued electric meters and detailed usage data. Sense successfully communicated whole-home watts at-a-glance during our testing. It also detected a few of the large appliances in the CNET Smart Home automatically. But like its competitor, Neurio, Sense had trouble identifying certain devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sense's FAQ page says it's working on algorithms to detect more products, so it might get smarter soon. For now, if you're looking for in-depth data about your home energy consumption, this home energy tracker is pretty limited and I wouldn't readily recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the electricity-dependent products in your home contribute to a total watt (W) or kilowatt-hour (kWh) reading. (Note: one kWh is 1,000W.) At any given time, you should be able to see real-time energy stats on your home's electric meter. This info is then used by your local electric company to calculate the amount you owe.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's a problem. Meters, especially traditional non-digital units, are difficult to read -- and they only give you an overview of your consumption, rather than itemized watt or kilowatt-hour readouts of individual devices. That means you're out of luck if you want to better understand why last month's bill was so high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, Sense should help you identify individual devices and figure out how to change your usage patterns. That's when you'll start to see savings and reduced strain on the electric grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smallish rectangular Sense attaches to the main switch inside your breaker panel and relies on two sensors to detect unique device \"signatures.\" While it took two electricians only 10 minutes to install Sense, this is not a do-it-yourself project. The installation requires the removal of the breaker panel and there are all sorts of potential shock hazards involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sense is compatible with recessed and wall-mounted electric panels. It will work with more than one panel if Sense is installed in the main electrical panel and the additional panels are subpanels. Not sure if it will work in your home? Check out the Sense FAQ for more info before you buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sense CEO Mike Phillips offered some insight on its device detection functionality via email:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Sense, products generating more energy are easier to single out, but it is possible for it to identify devices with a low 5W to 10W output.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's where Sense differentiates itself from Neurio, which wasn't able to detect any appliances under 400W. Sense attributes its ability to detect low-wattage devices to the 4 million readings it takes per second to identify unique patterns. Theoretically, this should give Sense an edge over the competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Sense is installed by a qualified professional, the device should chime to let you know the configuration was successful. Download the related Android or iPhone app and follow the instructions to connect it to your local Wi-Fi network. Sense doesn't currently have a web interface, so you're limited to viewing your energy stats on your mobile device.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can view a graph or a bubble chart of the wattage output in your home 24/7 (assuming you have a solid Wi-Fi connection). Walk around your house and flip light switches on an off, cook dinner, run the dishwasher and see the visual representations change accordingly in the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll also get emails when Sense detects new devices, but it doesn't always happen quickly. Sense was installed on February 16. On March 3 and 14, I got emails saying Sense had \"learned new devices.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, it has detected the dryer, two fridges and two \"unnamed motors.\" Everything else currently lives in either the \"Always On\" or \"Unnamed\" device label. After more than a month of testing, I would have expected it to pick up on more appliances. Sense told me its ability to detect products can be slower if the Wi-Fi signal isn't strong. Our connection at the CNET Smart Home goes in and out. I just checked its speed and got 6.72 Mbps for download speed and 0.90 Mbps for upload speed. Not terrible, but not great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, you can't really \"train\" your Sense device yourself. Instead, you have to wait for it to be certain it has identified a microwave or an air conditioner before it moves it from the \"unknown\" bubble to a specific label. Since you can't edit this information yourself, you're left waiting for Sense to catch up.  However, you can edit names of devices Sense identified as \"unnamed motors\" if you manage figure out what they are. I haven't had any luck with mine yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IFTTT rule I created with Sense worked well, though. Sense is supposed to be able to ID things like garage door openers, so you could create the following IFTTT applet: \"If Sense notices the garage door is opening, then turn on my LED bulbs/adjust my thermostat/open my window shades.\" Since I only had fridges and a dryer to work with my rule made a little less sense: \"If Sense notices the dryer turning off, then open the Lutron window shades.\" Still, the applet worked fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Sense is supposed to be able to detect devices with lower wattage outputs than Neurio, these two products are fairly similar. Both have decent apps that display real-time energy stats for the whole home. Neurio has a more hands-on approach, allowing you to turn devices on and off and label them accordingly. Sense takes this on for you, but seems to do it fairly slowly (again, this can vary based on the quality of your Wi-Fi connection).\n",
      "\n",
      "It might also matter that no one actually lives in the CNET Smart Home. We test products here every day, but  we aren't using the large appliances and smaller electronic devices the way someone living here would use them. Even so, I think five weeks should be enough time for Sense to identify the microwave, the HVAC unit and other electrical devices we use here day to day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sense costs $50 more than Neurio, but it hasn't managed to differentiate itself in any significant way over five weeks of testing. Usage stats are fairly limited and you don't have much control over how quickly it detects your appliances. It's a useful tool for real-time energy stats -- the house is currently using 576W of power, for instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just not sold on spending $299 (plus the cost of an electrician) for a device that has only successfully identified two fridges and a dryer in over a month. I'd hold off to see how we like the competitor Curb and the Indiegogo-funded energy monitor Ecoisme.\n",
      "Leviton Decora Smart Wi-Fi Plug-In Dimmer\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say, for the sake of argument, that you own a lamp. You like this lamp, but it's either on or off, with nothing in between. You can't dim it, and you wish that you could. Better yet, you wish that you could dim it with a simple Alexa voice command on your  \tAmazon Echo smart speaker  -- let's go ahead and say that you own one of those, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've got a couple of options. One would be to pick up  \t \tan Alexa-compatible smart bulb from a brand such as TP-Link, Lifx or Philips Hue. Another would be to smarten up the lamp itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where the Wi-Fi-enabled Leviton Decora plug-in dimmer comes in. Plug it in and plug that lamp of yours in behind it. You'll then be able to turn it on and off or dim it up and down remotely using the My Leviton app on your Android or iOS device, or by using Alexa voice commands. The asking price? $48 per plug.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a little steep for my tastes, especially considering you can pick up a  Belkin WeMo Mini smart switch for $35 or less. That switch won't let you dim the lights, but it boasts better third-party connections than the Decora lineup, and it also features a much, much less awkward design that doesn't block adjacent outlets or force you to plug your lamp in at an uncomfortable angle on the bottom of the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Decora plug has some good stuff going for it. Despite the fact that my phone   timed out during my first attempt at pairing with the plug, I came away impressed with the My Leviton app. It's simple to use, yet fully featured, with good controls for organizing multiple plugs by room and programming  automated lighting changes. You can also customize things like the lamp's dimmable range or the fade duration whenever you turn it on or off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many will also appreciate that the new Wi-Fi Decora devices speak the same language as your home network. That means you don't need to plug a hub into your router to act as translator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syncing up with Alexa is easy. Just enable the Leviton skill in the Alexa app and tell your Echo, Echo Dot or Tap to scan for new devices. From there,  you'll be able to tell Alexa to turn the lamp on or off or dim it up and down by using whatever name you gave it in the My Leviton app. Everything worked perfectly when I tested it out in   the CNET Smart Home.\n",
      "\n",
      "There wasn't much else for me to test out, though. There's no IFTTT channel for these plugs, and no compatibility with Nest or any other notable third-party products or services. Leviton  plans to sync Decora up with Apple HomeKit this May to bring Siri controls into play -- but in a dumbfounding move, that HomeKit compatibility will be part of an entirely new yet otherwise identical line of Wi-Fi Decora devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, buy it now and you'll miss out on HomeKit later. Names such as Ecobee and August have already learned the hard way that customers don't appreciate it when you separate features out like that -- now, Leviton is stepping on the same rake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a consumer misunderstanding that HomeKit is a feature to be added,\" explained Greg Rhoades, Director, Marketing, Energy Management, Controls and Automation at Leviton. \"In fact, it is an ecosystem and Leviton will provide a purely dedicated solution for these customers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If a consumer absolutely wants the simplicity and benefits of Apple HomeKit and wants to connect the growing number of devices,\" he went on, \"then yes -- they should wait for those SKUs in April.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In almost all cases, sticking with dimmable smart bulbs is a more cost-effective way of smartening up the lamps around your home. A fully dimmable, Alexa-compatible two-bulb   Philips Hue White starter kit costs $70 with additional bulbs costing just $15 each. I'd need a very good reason to go with Leviton over an option like that.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Philips Hue has long vied for domination of the smart LED lighting market, and it's leading the charge into color-changing candelabra bulbs ($154.99 at Amazon.com), too. Up until now, the best smart LED bulbs that would fit into most chandeliers or ceiling fans came from Feit, a smaller-name company with only middling candelabra bulbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although we haven't tested the new Philips bulbs yet, the company's record should give people hope. Its new White and Color Ambiance Candle bulbs will be available in Europe starting in April, and in North America later this year. (We don't yet know if it'll come to Australia.) The downside is that the Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Candle bulb will cost $50 (or about £40 or AU$65), which is significantly more than many competing bulbs (which often cost closer to $10).\n",
      "\n",
      "The big advantage the Hue Candle bulbs have is the existing Hue ecosystem -- a system compatible with HomeKit, Google Home and Amazon Echo. You'll be able to control the Candle bulbs along with other Hue bulbs using voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time, the Hue Candle bulbs won't be included in lighting kits, like this Philips Hue Starter Kit. That means people already invested in the Hue ecosystem will likely be the earliest adopters.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bathroom mirrors seem like the perfect place to add smarts: think touchscreens, voice assistants, maybe even personalized beauty tips. Sure, we're not quite there yet, but the $400 Viio Vezzo Bluetooth Mirror does take that first step toward connectivity (although the Vezzo doesn't ship to the UK or Australia yet, its pricing converts to about £330 and AU$530).\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of the promise of such technology, though, the Vezzo falls disappointingly short. It offers a few useful features, but they fail to cohere in any compelling way. And worst of all, the mirror -- an inherently visual object -- boasts no visual components, instead relying on Bluetooth speakers to stand out on the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, unless you crave the Vezzo's exact cocktail of features, you'll want to keep your money and wait for a truly smart mirror to revolutionize your bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vezzo is a 24-inch by 32-inch mirror that includes a border light for makeup work, an anti-fog button for when things get steamy and a Bluetooth button for connecting your phone. Between these three primary features, it's a surprisingly simple device.\n",
      "\n",
      "That simplicity contributes to a sleek design. The Vezzo looks modern, but blends surprisingly well with a variety of decors. The mirror is powered directly, using a plug for the outlet you typically find beside vanities. Of course, anyone who uses a blow dryer, straightener, trimmer or any number of other grooming gadgets knows those outlets are a hot commodity. Luckily, you can unplug the mirror for 6 hours at a time, as it has a backup battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vezzo's biggest strength is its ease of use. After a relatively quick install -- you have to anchor the mirror to the wall using a thin metal plate -- just tap one of the three touch-sensitive buttons on the front to activate the features.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's right: the Vezzo doesn't even have an app. When I realized this, I was simultaneously intrigued by the decidedly simple interface and disappointed by the Vezzo's meager features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vezzo costs $400. A speaker comparable to the Vezzo's costs well under $100. Mirrors with similar LED lighting and anti-fog features cost around $290. So it's not a bad deal for the whole package. The problem is, none of the features stand out and they don't work especially well in tandem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what I mean:\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, a hanging mirror like the Vezzo works best for a half bathroom -- where steam isn't much of an issue, you probably won't be applying makeup often and you won't be spending tons of time listening to audiobooks. In other words, the Vezzo's design and features seem to be working at cross-purposes. In the end, the Vezzo feels like a more polished MacGyver gadget -- a half-bath mirror with some full-bath features tacked on. And even if it does work in some full bathrooms, none of its features make it feel new or essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "While reviewing the Vezzo, I had to actively resist my expectations for what a \"smart\" mirror should be. Why knock a product that isn't trying to be what you expected it to be? But the promise of a connected mirror is inescapable: you don't spend mornings listening to mirrors -- you spend mornings looking at them. Without something like a touchscreen, or even just visualized weather or traffic updates, the whole device feels a little underwhelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vezzo isn't for everyone, but it's also not a terrible product. If you need LED lighting and anti-fog features on a hanging mirror, it isn't a bad deal. Throw in a middling Bluetooth speaker, and it might be a device worth considering.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you're looking for something special -- or even just a device with solid speakers, don't buy Viio's Bluetooth Mirror. Wait for something better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light helps brighten your face from all angles for detail work, but it doesn't offer color temperature variation like the SimpleHuman Mirror to help users replicate the natural light of their daily surroundings.The anti-fog button works by heating the glass to above the room's dew point, but you have to hit it 10 to 20 minutes before the room steams up for it to work effectively.The Bluetooth button lets you listen to music, the news, audiobooks and whatever else you can access on your phone -- but the quality of the speakers is far lower than a good $100 Bluetooth speaker.The mirror even includes a microphone, so you can take phone calls on it -- cool, right? But it doesn't connect with Wi-Fi to integrate a voice assistant, which would add a ton of appeal to an otherwise rather un-smart mirror. Even without Alexa or Google Assistant, something as simple as Spotify streaming would've been a welcome addition.\n",
      "Fremo Evo\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Amazon Echo Dot is a pint-size, puck-shaped version of the original, full-size Amazon Echo smart speaker. It's a low-cost access point for the Alexa voice assistant that can connect with external speakers via Bluetooth or via line-in jack, but it doesn't have a built-in battery. That means that you'll need to keep it plugged in -- and that you can't take it with you for room-to-room listening on the go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fremo Evo wants to help you change that. At $35, or £45 in the UK, it's a battery base for the second-gen Echo Dot that lets Alexa go unplugged for up to a stated six hours of battery-powered playback. Combine that with the $50/£50 you'll spend on an Echo Dot, and you're looking at a portable, voice-activated Alexa speaker for about 35 percent less than what you'd spend on Amazon's own battery-powered Alexa speaker, the Echo Tap.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a good deal (especially in the UK, where the Tap isn't even available), but keep in mind that the Dot has by far the weakest sound quality of Amazon's Alexa speakers -- barely much better than the speakers in your phone. And, though you can't activate it with your voice,  \tFabriq's third-party Alexa speaker offers the same portable approach complete with better sound and a better design -- all for just $50 flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Evo worked exceptionally well in my tests, with battery life that far exceeds the stated six hours of promised playback. It isn't quite as convenient as the Tap, but people who already own an Echo Dot and just want to take Alexa out on the porch with them every now and then should love this thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Evo keeps it simple -- just set the Echo Dot on top of it and connect the two using a dual-pronged adapter. You'll power it using your existing Echo Dot cable, then unplug whenever you want to take your speaker somewhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Evo comes in both white and black to match the color of your device, but it still compromises the Dot's clean, uniform design somewhat. Rigid teeth around the top of the battery form a sort of crown that the Dot sits in -- they're designed to prevent the battery from blocking off the speakers around the Dot's bottom rim. They work as promised, ensuring that the sound still gets out, but they also look a little janky compared with a plain Dot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front of the battery features four white LEDs that serve as battery indicators. The battery is fully charged when all four are lit -- from there, they'll drop out one by one as the juice runs out. Again, Fremo claims that'll take at least six hours of continuous playback.\n",
      "\n",
      "My tests bear that claim out -- and then some, to put it mildly. After giving the base a full charge, I attached an Echo Dot, then unplugged it and left it playing at full volume. Six hours later, it was still going strong, with three of those four battery indicators still lit up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up taking the speaker home with me to continue my tests. It kept on streaming my Spotify tunes for another several hours, finally running dry at three in the morning after roughly 13 hours of continuous use (save for about 30 minutes on standby as I drove home from the office with it). Afterward, it recharged in about four and a half hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of those are terrific results, and as I tested the Evo out, taking my Echo Dot around the house to listen to podcasts while in the shower or some music while I cooked dinner, I could absolutely see the product's appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it's not as elegant an option as the Amazon Tap ($129.99 at Amazon.com), which sits in a base to recharge. When you want to take it with you, you just pick it up and go, and when you're done, you just set it back in the base. You don't need to worry about the cable at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, a higher-end version of the Evo or something similar with a separate charging base might be a product worth waiting for. You might also consider spending a little extra on a  battery base that doubles as an enhanced speaker, given the Dot's relatively limited sound output. The Evo doesn't do anything to improve the Dot's volume or sound quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I like the Evo, and with its impressive battery life and relatively low price, I think it merits a look from Echo Dot owners who are happy with their speaker's native sound output but who wish they could take it with them around the house.\n",
      "Zmodo Torch Pro\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Zmodo's $200 Torch Pro -- roughly £165 and AU$265 converted -- is actually three separate products. You get a 720p camera hidden inside a color-changing outdoor LED, a motion-detector-equipped wired doorbell and a plug-in indoor Wi-Fi range extender. All of this stuff worked pretty well with the related Android or iPhone app to keep tabs on my front door.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's a big problem. The camera light is gigantic and wouldn't fit in any of the porch lights at my house or at the CNET Smart Home. The system also doesn't currently work with any smart home platforms and the app configuration and overall layout is confusing. The Torch Pro is an interesting concept with fine performance, but is ultimately much too unwieldy to recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Zmodo Torch Pro security light clocks in at 5.51 inches tall and 2.95 inches wide. Rather than having a traditional tapered shape, this light is roughly the same width from top to bottom -- with the exception of its smaller E26 socket. For this reason, it simply won't fit into most small- or medium-sized outdoor light fixtures.\n",
      "\n",
      "I even ventured to a home improvement store to try it with various porch lights on display. Even with dozens of options to choose from, it would only fit in the largest models. And, if the bottom of the porch light has a tapered design, you'll probably be completely out of luck regardless of size (this happened with the porch lights at the CNET Smart Home -- see the image to the right).\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation should have been simple, but I never managed to find a ready-installed light fixture big enough to support this device. Instead, I screwed it into an indoor table lamp for testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The color-changing LED claims a brightness rating of 350 lumens, a 5,000K color temperature and 100,000 hours of runtime. Those specs are roughly comparable to the Philips 40W Equivalent Candelabra LED. A 40W  replacement LED isn't very bright in terms of output. For comparison, brighter 60W replacement LEDs typically have at least 800 lumens and 100W replacement LEDs typically have at least 1,600 lumens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, the light looked bright enough when I dragged the indoor table lamp outside. It helps that it's designed for use in a porch light surrounded by glass rather than in a lamp diffused by a shade. You can dim the light and adjust its color in the Zmodo app. You can also set an on/off schedule so the lights turn on and off and any custom color settings adjust automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can pull up a live feed from the light's built-in 720p, 132-degree camera. Whenever the light is on, the camera will automatically display in night vision mode and revert to day mode when the light turns off.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the security light provides visibility, the wired doorbell detects motion.  If you're familiar with standard doorbell wiring, you can definitely install the Zmodo buzzer yourself. It took our technical editor, Steve, only 15 minutes to remove the existing doorbell and replace it with the Zmodo model. It probably would have taken me closer to 30 minutes from start to finish. Of course, if you're iffy on this process, always consult a professional. A battery-powered design for the Zmodo doorbell would obviously be easier, but it wouldn't be practical given the power demands of continuous video streaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever the doorbell detects activity, it sends a push alert to your phone. Click on the alert to pull up a live feed from the camera light and use the two-way audio feature in the doorbell to talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this functionality worked well, for the most part. I received prompt motion alerts, was able to quickly pull up a live video feed on the camera app -- and the scheduling function automatically adjusted the light settings to my exact specifications. The two way talk feature was pretty hit-or-miss, though, with poor audio quality on both ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bigger problem was getting everything configured in the app in the first place. Both the instructions from the box and the app were confusing. Basically, there are three main connection methods and the app doesn't tell you which one you need, so you're left guessing (see the screenshot below).\n",
      "\n",
      "After about an hour without any luck, I called customer service and they helped me connect everything very quickly. Still, this sort of set up shouldn't be that complex. And even after you connect everything, the cluttered app layout makes it difficult to find what you're looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of connected porch-light-style security systems, the Kuna and the Toucan both do a better job. The Kuna is a porch light with an integrated camera, whereas the Toucan is a camera accessory that attaches to existing porch lights. They work with regular non-smart bulbs, but the related apps offer advanced integrations between the light and the camera. Like the Torch Pro, these products don't work with IFTTT, Amazon Alexa, or any other smart home platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zmodo markets its $200/£165/AU$265 Torch Pro as a simple system for your DIY smart home. But due to the size of its security light, you'll probably have to buy and install a larger light fixture just to accommodate it. The app setup and overall layout needs work, too, and the Torch Pro doesn't currently work with any smart home platforms. I'd strongly suggest looking at either the  Kuna or the Toucan porch light security cameras instead.\n",

The PebbyBall is a small, lithium-ion-powered robot covered in a polycarbonate shell that's supposedly \"shatterproof\" and \"waterproof.\" Your dog or cat can bat around this 3-inch robo-ball just like any other toy, but there are also some hidden smarts inside. You can set the PebbyBall to \"Auto-Play,\" \"Auto-Follow\" or \"Auto-Repel\" mode or use the related Pebby app on your Android or iOS device to control the ball yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PebbyBall also has a built-in 720p high definition night vision camera inside. That means you should be able to view a live video feed and even talk to your pet via its two-way intercom function. I'm not sure how well a rolling ball would be able to capture video, but it's designed to run for up to 1.5 hours of active time and 15 hours in standby mode. When your PebbyBall's battery is low, it's supposed to return to the PebbyKennel charging dock just like a robot vacuum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PebbyCollar completes the Pebby kit. This little gizmo goes on your pet's collar and is supposed to track their activity and give you an overview in the app. Its rechargeable battery should last for up to 12 days.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Editors' note: Researchers found a bug with SmartCam model SNH-1011 in January 2017 that temporarily made it more susceptible to hacks. Samsung has since issued a firmware update to address the problem. The Samsung SmartCam PT was not part of this reported security flaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung's $229 (£185 and AU$300, converted) SmartCam PT is a decent DIY security camera. It offers cloud and local storage, solid motion zones and motion tracking via an integrated pan-tilt lens, as well as a privacy mode you can schedule based on your daily routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its default motion- and audio-sensor settings were way too sensitive at the outset, but a quick adjustment in the app made them a little more reliable. The bigger problem is that I haven't seen any real advancement in the SmartCam line in three years. The smart-home security market has grown so much since I tested the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro in early 2014. But we're still stuck with the same outdated, annoying-to-navigate SmartCam app and no smart home integrations whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Samsung owns the SmartThings smart home platform, I'm stumped as to why the SmartCam PT doesn't work with more products from other manufacturers, or at least SmartThings' own connected accessories. The SmartCam PT's lack of integrations and relatively high price ultimately make it impossible to recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SmartCam PT is surprisingly compact, particularly for a pan-tilt camera. Because pan-tilt models need to, well, pan and tilt, their hardware has to include mechanisms that allow for movement. As a result, they typically have clunkier, more utilitarian designs than their fixed-angle counterparts, like the Nest Cam Indoor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SmartCam PT isn't any more stylish than Foscam's Plug and Play FI9826P or D-Link's Pan & Tilt Network Camera, but its small size does make it a more discreet addition to a home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the SmartCam PT's key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding your SmartCam PT to the SmartCam Android or iPhone app is as simple as you'd expect. Create an account, and follow the instructions to get the camera online. This process took me about 10 minutes, mainly because one of the steps requires waiting up to three minutes for the camera's status LED to change from blue to green.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the app, you can view the live feed, set your motion zones, opt-in to motion tracking and more. The problem is finding everything. Not only does the app look like it was designed in the early days of the internet, it also isn't organized in a particularly logical way. You'll get used to the layout over time, but the ideal scenario is an app that both looks nice and makes it easy for you to find the information you need. You won't find that here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SmartCam PT performed pretty well, delivering speedy alerts when the audio or motion sensors detected activity. The notifications arrived far too close together at first, picking up on the slightest sound and movement. Fortunately, you can adjust the audio and motion sensitivity in the app, and this helped to some extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motion-tracking feature worked reliably most of the time, but it never noticed me when I was more than about 10 feet away from the camera. And, when motion tracking is enabled, regular audio- and motion-sensor detection and related alerts are automatically disabled. Still, motion tracking worked much better here than it did with the $80 Ezviz Mini 360 Plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can easily view recorded activity clips in the app via cloud storage or local microSD card storage. Use a microSD card reader to download any clips you'd like to save.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you don't care about smart-home integrations, I wouldn't recommend the $229 Samsung SmartCam PT. The app is tricky to navigate, the audio and motion sensors are somewhat unreliable and it costs more than your average DIY home security camera. You can find it on Amazon for just $175, but I still think that's too high for what it offers.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The lock just flashed at me.\" \t \t \t \t \t \t\"Yeah,\" I told my roommate, Zach. \"It's a status indicator. Green means unlocked. I can turn it off in the app if it's bothering you.\" \t \t \t \t \t \t \tZach sighed. \"Whatever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So it goes at Casa Crist, where I occasionally bring home a smart-home gadget to test for a few days. The latest: the Kwikset Kevo Convert Bluetooth Smart Lock. At $150, it's cheaper than most other smart locks on the market, and unlike many of them, it doesn't actually replace your existing lock. Instead, you'll install it on the inside of your door, where it will automatically lock or unlock your deadbolt whenever you tell it to using the Kevo app on your Android or iOS device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Convert's retrofit approach makes it an appealing pick for renters who aren't allowed to swap their deadbolt out (and for an indifferent roommate like Zach, who'd rather just stick with the key he's already got). It also worked reliably well during the week or so I tested it, with a steady Bluetooth connection to my phone and an integration with my  \t \t \tNest Learning Thermostat that let me toggle the thermostat between Home and Away modes whenever I unlocked or locked the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are compromises here, though -- namely, the need to be within Bluetooth range to check the Convert's status on your phone or lock it remotely. The third-party integrations with Nest and IFTTT also didn't go as deep as I'd like, and you can't connect it with any other smart home platforms -- no Wink or SmartThings, no Apple HomeKit and no Amazon Alexa, either. I like the Convert as a means of sharing digital access to your door, but at $150, I wish it didn't feel quite so limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Convert is really just the interior half of the original Kwikset Kevo -- the part with the Bluetooth radio, the motorized lock-turning mechanism and the battery pack that powers it. You don't get the original Kevo's touch-to-open feature, but you do get its same baseline smarts that you control with the same Kevo app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looks-wise, the Convert is clean and simple, if not striking. It's smaller than the interior of other smart locks from names like Yale and Schlage, but only very slightly so. It's not nearly as eye-catching as the  \t \tAugust Smart Lock, which takes a similar retrofit approach, but it's definitely not an eyesore, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you jump in with the Convert (or with any smart lock that automatically turns your deadbolt),     you'll want to check your door to make sure it's smart-lock-compatible. Here's what to look for:\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll also want to make sure that the Convert is compatible with your Android or iOS device -- particularly on the Android side,     where Android 5.0 or better is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had absolutely no trouble installing the Convert on my front door, thanks in large part to the detailed, illustrated step-by-step instructions in the Kevo app. All I needed was a screwdriver and about 10 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that my front door uses a Kwikset deadbolt likely helped my installation, but the Convert will work with other kinds of locks, too. It even comes with multiple sets of parts and adapters -- and again, the app does a great job of helping you through the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the Convert is successfully affixed to your door, you'll pair with it over Bluetooth using the Kevo app. From there, you'll be able to check the lock's status on your phone or lock and unlock it remotely, provided you're within Bluetooth range. You'll also be able to share \"eKeys\" that authorize other people to control the lock, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "An existing standard deadbolt that sits separately above the knob or handleA door that's between 1 3/8 and 1 3/4 inches (38mm and 44mm) thickProper alignment with the doorframe -- you shouldn't need to push or pull on the doorknob in order to turn the lock\n",
      "\n",
      "So why would you want a Bluetooth connection to your deadbolt? Here are some of the most common scenarios:\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that worked perfectly when I tested it, but there are a couple of caveats to keep in mind. The most obvious is that you can't control the lock or view its status from outside of Bluetooth range. You also can't connect it with a third-party smart home platform like Wink or SmartThings to extend the range, the way you can with competing smart locks (including Kwikset's own Z-Wave models). The only way to do so with the Convert is to buy the   Kevo Plus Wi-Fi plug-in gateway device for an extra $100. And no, spending that kind of money on a hub that only controls one kind of gadget doesn't feel like a good deal to me, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another limitation: There's no way to control this lock with your voice. It doesn't work with Apple HomeKit, which rules Siri out. Even though Amazon now offers developers   dedicated smart-lock programming tools, the Convert won't work with Alexa either. All's quiet on the Google Assistant front, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there's a lot that this lock gets right. In particular, the Kevo app does a great job with user management, offering easy controls for emailing eKeys to friends and contacts. I especially appreciated how easy it was to set time restrictions on those eKeys, including fully customizable Scheduled eKeys that only work on the days and times you set, as well as Guest eKeys that simply stop working after 24 hours. Best of all: Kwikset doesn't charge fees for those eKeys anymore. All of them are totally free and unlimited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lock history section of the app is another nice touch. It offers users an accurate and detailed list of comings and goings. It only works with app-enabled entry, though -- use your key to get in, or lock the door by turning the deadbolt by hand, and it won't show up in the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Convert also takes advantage of the original Kevo's third-party smart-home integrations -- namely with Nest, IFTTT and video doorbells from SkyBell and Ring. The Nest integration worked fine, with a little pop-up that would ask me if I wanted to toggle my thermostat between Away mode and Home mode whenever I'd use the Kevo app to lock or unlock my door. But again, that only works if you're using the app to control the lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IFTTT integration was much less successful. The Kevo channel is limited to begin with -- it only lets you trigger IFTTT recipes by locking or unlocking your door using the app. And while you can use the Convert to trigger your IFTTT recipes, you can't use your IFTTT recipes to trigger the Convert. That eliminates a potential workaround for things like Alexa voice locking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse still, my test recipes didn't work. I suspect this has to do with the fact that IFTTT uses your phone as a relay to connect with the lock itself, and maybe the recipes would have worked like a charm if I had a Kevo Plus installed to play the role of relay, instead. Still, if you count IFTTT compatibility as a key selling point, temper your expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations aside, I like the Kevo Convert. I think it's a good fit for renters, and a perfectly fine choice for anyone who wants a simple smart lock that can manage access across multiple users. The retrofit design makes it a direct competitor to the   August Smart Lock, one of our favorites in the category. The Convert offers many of the same features at a lower price.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Convert demands compromises, too. At a time when more and more smart locks are offering integrations that will let you include them in a larger home automation platform or control them with voice commands, the Convert sticks with a basic, Bluetooth approach that largely silos itself off from the rest of the smart home. That's fine if all you want is basic user access control. But if you're thinking bigger, you'll want to look elsewhere.\n",

      "\n",
      "The $200 (£160 and AU$260 converted) 1080p HD D-Link Omna is a fine security camera, delivering prompt motion alerts and storing activity locally on a microSD card. It's also the first camera to work with Apple's smart home platform, HomeKit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, this integration is a milestone for the iOS 10 software, but HomeKit still has far fewer integrations than competitors like Amazon Alexa. You can still set up automations within Apple's Home app that link the motion sensor inside the Omna to select HomeKit devices, but there just isn't much feature depth here (yet). Because of that limitation, the ability to view your Omna camera's live feed from Apple's Home app isn't hugely appealing today.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Omna is very much a niche product, one that only makes sense for early HomeKit adopters who don't mind waiting for broader, better integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Omna has a light silver-gray finish and a tall cylindrical design, with access to a microSD card slot on the bottom (it supports up to a 128GB microSD card, which isn't included). It's a fine looking camera, but D-Link's hardware choices don't necessarily make it easier to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, the Nest Cam Indoor has an extremely thoughtful layout. Its durable but flexible magnetic base twists and rotates with ease, and you can separate the camera from its base for a more permanent wall-mount installation. In other words, the Nest Cam's design enhances its usability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Omna's design is much less modular than the Nest Cam's. It doesn't have a flexible base, and you don't have the option of mounting this camera to a wall. You have to put your Omna on a flat surface, or nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious how the Omna's specs compare to other DIY cams? Take a peek at the chart below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from its 1080p high-definition video streaming resolution and HomeKit compatibility, the Omna camera's main selling point is its 180-degree field of view. This wide-angle lens sees more than the Nest Cam Indoor, the Netgear Arlo Pro and many other DIY cams on the market. The video gets somewhat distorted at the far corners of the feed, but that's a common issue with 180-degree lenses. That problem was even more exaggerated with the Piper Classic and NV security systems we tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Omna also offers local storage, which is a significant deviation from many of the mainstream models' optional cloud subscription services. Here's an overview of local versus cloud storage, but the gist is that local storage doesn't pass through a remote server. Instead, your video footage stays in your house. One major complaint about local storage relates to theft -- it's a lot easier to steal a microSD card than it is to access a remote server's video cache. On the other hand, you don't have to worry about the reliability or security limitations of a distant server.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, D-Link's Omna doesn't currently have an Android app. Since it's a HomeKit device, that isn't incredibly surprising. But plenty of HomeKit-enabled products are versatile enough to work with both Android and iOS -- you'd just ignore the HomeKit component if you're an Android customer. August's second-generation Smart Lock immediately comes to mind as an example.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this just isn't the case with the Omna. Even the Omna's native app -- also called Omna -- is heavily tied to HomeKit in terms of design and configuration. If you aren't invested in HomeKit, the Omna camera really isn't for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Omna iPhone app doesn't have a login or a registration process. You don't have to enter your email address and wait for a confirmation message to appear in your inbox. Nada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, you simply open the app and select \"Add Accessory.\" Make sure your Omna cam is powered on and that the mobile device you're using for configuration is on the local network you plan to connect to your camera. Then, you wait for the app to recognize the Omna camera. This didn't work for me right away, so I moved closer to the camera, and presto! (See screenshot below.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Continue to follow the instructions in the app, including scanning the HomeKit code located on the camera and adding the camera and its built-in motion detector to specific rooms in your house. I tested my Omna in the CNET Smart Home living room and labeled it accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you're ready to use your camera in the Omna app or in the Home app. The camera and its motion sensor should populate in the Home app automatically as two separate \"accessories.\" The Omna app allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor and set motion zones. The Home app doesn't have this functionality, but you can view the camera's live feed from the Home app and incorporate the camera into select automations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I created automations based on the Omna motion sensor detecting activity, such as, \"If the Omna detects motion, then turn on all the lights.\" I was also able to ask Siri for the status of my security camera or for the status of my motion detector, which would either pull up the Omna's live feed in the Home app or simply reply that the motion sensor either was or wasn't currently detecting activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motion detector and the related push alerts were responsive. The recorded video clips were easy to view in the app -- or view and download using a microSD card reader. The motion detection zones also helped me turn off detection in the area where our large Haiku ceiling fan is located in the living room. But the overall video quality wasn't quite as crisp as the Nest Cam's 1080p. Check out the two screenshots below to compare the Omna's live feed to the Nest Cam's. The Omna can clearly see more of the room, but the Nest Cam's picture quality is slightly better (even though they both claim 1080p HD).\n",
      "\n",
      "D-Link's $200 Omna is a decent security camera. Its live feed and related alerts were reliable. Its motion detection zones made it simple to focus only on certain areas. Its 180-degree field of view lets you see more of a room, although you'll deal with some picture distortion as a trade-off. And the Omna's local microSD card storage gives you more control over your video clips.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Omna is the first camera available for retail that works with Apple's HomeKit platform. While that opens up the Omna to integrations with other HomeKit devices and some Siri voice commands, Apple's smart home software is still behind the curve in terms of product partners. For that reason, the Home app doesn't offer the breadth of integrations I hoped to see at this stage in the smart home game. If you're already invested in HomeKit, the Omna makes a fine choice. Everyone else should hold off and see what's on the horizon.\n",
      "Petnet SmartFeeder\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me get this out of the way up front -- my husband and I spoil the crap out of our dog, Halley. We buy her overpriced toys she sometimes shreds in minutes; we relinquish large sections of the couch to her when we watch a movie; we generally find it charming when she covertly rolls in a mud puddle...\n",
      "\n",
      "And, like all pet owners, we also care a lot about her health and strive to balance her high energy demands with the right amount of quality kibble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter Petnet's SmartFeeder. Not only is this $149 product designed to hold up to 7 pounds of dry dog or cat food and auto-dispense designated amounts on a fixed schedule, the related app also weighs in on how much you should feed your pet. It even offers up a \"Food Report Card\" with a detailed nutritional profile of your pet's chow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know $149 is a lot to dish out for a food bowl, but we're just the type of overzealous dog people to consider it. My week-long testing experience didn't at all match up with the SmartFeeder's promises, though. Inaccurate dispensing, feeder jams, an odd design that made it difficult for Halley to reach all of her food and an occasionally glitchy app seriously damaged the SmartFeeder's initial appeal. Consider an alternative product or wait for Petnet to improve its current design before you buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petnet's SmartFeeder is a Wi-Fi food bowl for dogs and cats with an automatic dispenser and a related Android and iPhone app. Pour up to 7 pounds of dry food in the reservoir and close the lid -- Petnet stipulates that the food should measure between 1/8 and 5/8 inches in diameter and the SmartFeeder can dispense between 1/16- and 1 1/2-cup portions per feeding. Because of its dispensing limitations and smaller bowl size, this product is recommended only for small or medium-sized dogs under 50 pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation is simple -- follow the guide to connect the food bowl and its stainless steel insert to the rest of the SmartFeeder. Your purchase includes an 8-foot \"chew resistant\" power adapter, but it can also run on rechargeable battery power for roughly 7 hours. The feeder is fairly large at 15.32 inches tall, but it has a modern design that looked good in our home. And its lid has childproof-style locking tabs that you slide out to open, ensuring that your pet won't be able access it easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "App configuration was similarly straightforward. Download the app, create an account, verify your account through your email, assemble the SmartFeeder using the step-by-step instructions and enter in details about your pet. This includes the specific brand and type of food your pet eats, as well as how often you feed them and how many cups you give them per meal. You can adjust the amount manually, but the app will also offer a suggested quantity using the details you provided earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petnet also works with Nest Cam Indoor. Nest Cam customers who also subscribe to the optional Nest Aware video recording service can view video footage of their pet eating in the Petnet app. While you can opt-in to receive alerts when your pet's food is dispensed, this Nest integration is supposed to offer a second level of confirmation that your pet was fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all sounds pretty good, but how does the SmartFeeder compare to other pet feeders in terms of price and features? The category varies widely from $10 food and water dispensers that aren't smart, but will refill the bowl when it's empty to $100+ smart feeders like Petnet's.\n",
      "\n",
      "One interesting SmartFeeder competitor, the $110 RolliTron RolliPet Pet Feeder, actually has a built-in 720p high-definition camera. So instead of buying the $149 Petnet SmartFeeder and the $200 Nest Cam Indoor separately, RolliTron theoretically offers similar functionality from a single device -- and for less money overall. I haven't tested RolliTron or any other smart pet feeders yet (aside from the Petnet SmartFeeder), but it certainly seems like an interesting alternative device.\n",
      "\n",
      "More often than not Halley's food arrived as scheduled and in the correct amount. I even received a prompt, related alert telling me \"Halley was fed 1 1/4 cups of food at 6:15 am/6pm.\" But the food never once fully dispensed into the bowl. Instead, a significant portion remained in a hard-to-reach space between the food reservoir and the bowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Halley eats Nutro \"Small Bites,\" rounded small pieces of food that conform to Petnet's guidelines for chow. Even so, this was a consistent problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Petnet representative told me I could schedule two consecutive feedings to prevent the problem, which might also be more likely to happen if you're dispensing close to the 1 1/2-cup maximum meal portion. Since Petnet had suggested we feed Halley 1 1/4 cups per meal, I tried reducing the feedings to 3/4 cups. But a lot of food still remained in the feeder where Halley couldn't reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also tried with a couple additional types of food of different shapes and sizes -- same problem. At one point, the food collecting in the feeder caused a jam and Halley only got some of her food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petnet is aware of this issue and offers a ramp device to angle the SmartFeeder roughly 12 degrees for free -- just enough to push the food forward. This contraption helped, but it isn't included with your purchase so you'll likely need to rig your own wedge or reach out to Petnet's customer service to get their version. This Amazon user's video review of the SmartFeeder from March 2016 relied on binders underneath the product to create a wedge. While these clever workarounds do the trick (more or less), there's still a significant flaw with the SmartFeeder's core design.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also experienced a couple of odd glitches during testing -- the SmartFeeder dispensed food at the right time, but the timestamp on the related alert was off by 3 hours. The Petnet app controls the timezone automatically, so I'm not sure why it thought I was in the Pacific time zone for those two feedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another occasion, Halley didn't get any food and no related alert appeared to let us know there was a problem. (This is when it would be handy to have a camera monitoring feedings.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Petnet said this was likely due to a firmware update that could have caused an outage and interrupted feedings. Related to that, customers don't have control over when software updates are pushed live, so it could potentially happen unexpectedly during your pet's feeding. A representative told me Petnet normally issues firmware updates at night when most SmartFeeders aren't in use. But that certainly wasn't the case with Halley's 6:15am breakfast feeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the occasion that we're late getting home, I wanted Petnet's $149 SmartFeeder to swoop in and handle Halley's dinner for us. The added benefit of nutritional data and suggested portion amounts also appealed to me. But the dispenser and related app integrations just weren't consistent enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I definitely don't want to worry that my dog didn't get fed because of a scheduled firmware update, however infrequent. I also don't want to have to buy a Nest Cam to confirm whether or not a feeding happened -- or shove a binder under it to create the right angle for proper food dispensation. Skip Petnet's SmartFeeder and look instead to another Wi-Fi feeder or simply stick to the old fashioned method -- feeding your pet yourself.\n",
      "U by Moen Smart Shower\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, I hit a button on the U by Moen app on my phone and turned on my shower. I hadn't even entered the bathroom yet, but I wasn't worried about wasting water. While I brushed my teeth and got ready, the U by Moen Smart Shower flushed the cold water from the pipes until it had reached my perfect temp. Then, it paused the water flow and sent a notification to my phone letting me know my shower was ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the U by Moen Smart Shower set up in a freshly renovated bathroom in the CNET Smart Home -- complete with one large main showerhead, a handheld showerhead, and four body sprays built into the wall. The temperature control is accurate and the app is intuitive and surprisingly useful. Especially for a guy accustomed to a simple setup in a bachelor pad, it's -- in a word -- luxurious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U by Moen Smart Shower fits that word well, actually. It's a luxury purchase through and through. The four outlet version we have at the smart home costs $2,200. The two outlet version (so for a shower head and a single other nozzle) costs $1,160. Neither price includes the shower heads themselves or the cost of installation -- just the control panel and a fancy valve. You can find plenty of nice shower heads with a faucet for $100 to $200. So if you're just interested in the smarts, wait for cheaper and easier-to-install alternatives. If you're in the market for a luxury remodel, the U by Moen makes sense -- it adds useful connected capabilities for around the price you'd pay for a non-connected control panel setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two pieces you get when you purchase the smart shower -- the digital controller and the valve -- will theoretically work even on your existing showerhead. Moen's site calls the installation easy, but this is definitely not a snap-in-place smart gadget. It might technically be DIY, in the sense that building a house could be called DIY if you have the right know how, but most of us will want a plumber to do the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can buy the U by Moen Smart Shower on Home Depot's website, build.com, efaucets.com and in wholesale bath and kitchen showrooms. You can preorder it now, and it ships starting March 1. Whether you preorder or wait, the price is the same: The four outlet version costs $2,200 and the two-outlet model costs $1,160. The Smart Shower is only available in the US and Canada for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being admittedly much nicer than any shower I can remember using, a few things prevented my experience with the Moen Smart Shower from being perfect. I got into the U by Moen Smart Shower, hit a button to unpause it, then waited a few seconds. In the couple of minutes of downtime between when the shower paused and when I hopped in, the temp of the water in the pipes had lost 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit of heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "That problem is accentuated if you switch to the body sprays -- watch out for an initial blast of cold water while Moen works the hot stuff to the front of those pipes as well. It's hard to feel like you're at a spa when you get a surprise blast of cold water in your face when you first turn on the handheld shower nozzle.\n",
      "\n",
      "These hardware issues aren't Moen's fault -- it's designed to precisely control the water output temp, not heat your pipes -- but it's worth keeping in mind that the system isn't magic. If your house has low water pressure or a small hot water tank, this expensive smart shower system isn't going to fix those problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valve -- called a digital thermostatic valve -- is the complicated and expensive piece. It mixes the hot and cold water precisely so you can set the water temp to a specific degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have plumbing experience and are thinking of doing this yourself, know that you'll need a sizable access panel by the thermostatic valve for maintenance, though you don't have to install it directly behind the shower. The included cord that runs to the control panel is long enough that you can install the panel up to 30 feet away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plumber who worked on the setup in the CNET Smart Home told me the process is much more complicated than simply installing an ordinary faucet, as you'd expect. Non-digital thermostatic valves are becoming more common in high-end houses -- not only do they allow precise temperature control, but they regulate the pressure. When I flushed the toilet right next to the shower, the temp didn't budge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital thermostatic valves are still pretty rare -- you'll only find one or two at stores like Home Depot. Given the prices are comparably high for similar models from Kohler, Moen isn't charging a huge premium for its app connectivity. It's the digital thermostatic valve that makes this purchase a lofty one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, you're buying professional quality lab equipment for your home -- the multi-thousand dollar intellifaucets we use for testing laundry machines and dishwashers calibrate the temp 60 times a second. Moen's valve impressively keeps up by calibrating 50 times a second. That's much more precision than you'd ever be able to feel while showering, but it's nice to know Moen didn't skimp on the quality of its equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you do get everything installed, the control panel is simple to use -- complete with buttons to control the temp, activate presets, and turn the various nozzles on or off. I had no idea what my ideal shower temp was before using this smart shower, so the in-shower temp controls came in handy. I found my sweet spot at 105 degrees Fahrenheit, which then allowed me to build a detailed preset in the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "With each preset, you can customize the temp, a greeting that will show up on the control panel, which nozzles you'd like active, and what happens when the shower is ready. With mine, I have the shower pause the water and send me a push notification. You can also set a timer for each preset. Once the timer runs out, you can have the shower alert you or even turn off completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "These functions have implications beyond simply luxury. By warming up and pausing your shower, Moen helps you conserve water in the meantime. By shutting off the water after you've decided your teenage children have had enough time to get clean, you can help encourage them to take shorter showers. That said, there's nothing to stop your teen from just turning the water right back on once the timer expires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app allows you to customize two presets that you activate with the buttons on the shower's control panel. You can also build up to 10 other presets that you can activate from the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weirdly, the app stumbles over the process if you don't close it out entirely between your showers. Repeatedly during testing, I'd hit the button to start my preset. The shower would turn on for a moment, then pause and tell me that my shower was ready, even though it had been hours since I'd used it and Moen hadn't cycled out the cold water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when the preset works as intended, the shower only stays paused for five minutes. If you start your shower and forget about it, it won't try to keep the water warm by running briefly every now and then, it'll just cancel your shower. I appreciated that feature, as it might stop the shower from wasting lots of water if you forget about it for a day, but a keep-warm option might be nice if you're pulled away for 15 or 20 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the presets, you can also control all of the basic shower functions via the app, so you're free to mess with your spouse by turning on body spray nozzles from afar while he or she tries to shower in peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the future, Moen hopes to make the system even smarter, and a rep mentioned both Amazon's Alexa and Apple's HomeKit as possible integrations -- though she wouldn't confirm that the shower has the MFi chip HomeKit requires. I'd certainly like to be able to turn on my shower with a voice command to my Amazon Echo. She noted that nothing is official right now. She assured me, though, that Moen will send any updates over the air to existing smart showers. That's possible for Alexa, but not for HomeKit if it doesn't have that MFi chip. Moen will do its best to make sure your fancy purchase doesn't quickly become obsolete, but tread carefully if you're a HomeKit user.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U by Moen Smart Shower charmed me without quite winning me over. Moen's app walks the line between tech and simplicity well. It adds genuinely useful connectivity to a device that we all know works fine without bells and whistles, but Moen kept the additions simple, intuitive and effective. If I could easily and cheaply add just its smarts to my existing shower setup, I'd do it without hesitation and recommend this system broadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, for those of us that just want connected convenience, the barrier to entry for this setup is too steep. This isn't a connected DIY gadget, it's an investment in a luxury shower setup. In that light, at $2,200 for the four-outlet version we tested, and $1,160 for a two-outlet smart shower, the U by Moen is actually reasonably priced. If you're remodeling and want a control panel in your new, fancy shower, the U by Moen provides convenient extras with its app for not much more than you'd pay for an ordinary control panel and precision valve. The app isn't perfect and the system isn't magic, but it adds enough innovation to the basics to be worth your consideration as a high-end upgrade.\n",
      "Lux Geo Thermostat\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lux's $149 Geo thermostat, available in the US only, has a flexible design you can mount either horizontally or vertically. You also have the choice of a white or a black finish and the related app makes it easy to set a heating and cooling schedule, as well as a geofencing radius for automatic home and away mode adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It performs well, and its unique convertible design gives it extra points, but the Geo's price doesn't quite match up with what it offers customers. In particular, Lux's smart thermostat has zero smart-home integrations, where competing models from Honeywell, Ecobee and Emerson all at least work with Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa. The Lux Geo is a decent choice, but not if you're in search of the best value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only is the Lux Geo's horizontal/vertical mount appealing from a practical standpoint -- you may not have to drill new holes in your wall or cover previously hidden patches of last generation's paint color if you have two mounting options.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also looks neat. No, it isn't exactly the modern touchscreen aesthetic we've seen lately from Honeywell, Nest and Ecobee, but its minimal digital display and dial controller keep things simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious about the Geo's specs and features? Take a peek at this comparison chart:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lux Geo falls in line with the Honeywell Lyric T5, the Ecobee3 Lite and the Emerson Sensi as a new, lower priced thermostat that's still high-end and mostly smart. No, you won't find any algorithmic learning or any smart-home integrations here (not yet, at least -- Lux says it has an Alexa skill coming \"around March 1\"), but the Geo does come with a related Android or iPhone app and geofencing for a degree of home/away mode automation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, like the Nest Learning Thermostat ($247.99 at Amazon.com) and the Emerson Sensi, the Geo doesn't require a C-wire to operate. Not sure what that means? Check out this post for more details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation took less than 10 minutes in my case, mainly because I didn't have to drill any new holes. When in doubt,  contact a professional to help with this step. Configuring the thermostat was also straightforward -- download the app, create an account, verify your email address, and follow the steps to connect your Geo to your Wi-Fi network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once it's online, the app will prompt you to name your thermostat and set a seven-day schedule by dragging the times to match up with your routine. After setting a schedule, the app will give you the option of creating a geofencing radius. This feature sets a distance threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "When your phone crosses it, your thermostat knows you're either home or away and will adjust the settings accordingly. Geofencing also overrides your fixed seven-day schedule in the event that you drop by your house when your schedule thinks you should be at work or vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lux Geo performed consistently well during testing. It stuck to the schedule I created unless the geofencing feature noticed an inconsistency. Then, it would make the needed adjustments and send me an alert -- \"Radius ended Away/Home mode.\" You can also make any manual adjustments to the temperature or other setting using the app or the dial on the thermostat itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I want Lux to update its app design to something a little more current, and I really wish it worked with at least one smart-home platform. The Honeywell Lyric T5 costs $150, offers scheduling and geofencing, and works with Amazon Alexa and Apple HomeKit. The two potentially important caveats are that Honeywell's Lyric T5 requires a C-wire, and it doesn't offer multiple mounting options.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $169 Ecobee3 Lite has even more smart-home partners than the Lyric T5, but it doesn't support geofencing and you still need a C-wire to install it. Emerson's $160 Sensi works with Amazon Alexa and it doesn't require a C-wire, but it doesn't have a geofencing feature, either. You'll definitely need to think about the exact features you want from a smart thermostat before you buy, but most of the Geo's competitors are significantly smarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $149 Lux Geo's geofencing feature and C-wire-optional installation give it definite appeal, but it's the flexible horizontal/vertical layout that truly differentiates it from other smart thermostats. The lack of smart-home partners is disappointing, particularly compared to the $169 Ecobee3 Lite's multitude of integrations, but that won't be a deal-breaker for everyone, especially since the Geo is available for 20 bucks less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, the Geo doesn't offer as many features as its competitors, and why should you pay roughly the same amount for a connected thermostat that does less? Short answer: you shouldn't -- unless you want the install versatility only the Geo can offer.\n",
      "Yale Assure Keyless Bluetooth Smart Lock\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A lock without a key\" might sound like a lyric from a depressing piece of country music, but it's actually the pitch for the Yale Assure smart lock. For $200, it's a deadbolt that offers a touchpad for coded entry, a Bluetooth radio to pair with a companion app on your phone and, notably, absolutely no place to put a key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keyless locks like this one eliminate the threat of someone breaking in using a lockpick or a bump key, but they also remove a time-tested means of entry -- your key -- from the equation. With the Assure on your door, your only means of getting in are the touchpad and the companion app. And, given that you can get a keyless touchpad lock sans smarts  \t \tfor roughly half the price of this one, there's an awful lot of pressure on that app to make the Assure a worthwhile upgrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the Assure doesn't even come close. You can't use the app to lock the door from afar, and it won't even tell you if the door is locked in the first place. Aside from sharing access with others, all the app really offers is a way to pull out your phone and use it to unlock the door when you're already standing right in front of it. At that point, I don't know why you wouldn't just leave your phone in your pocket and punch in your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an extra $50, you can upgrade the Assure with a  \t \tZ-Wave or ZigBee radio module, or, starting in April, a $75 Apple HomeKit module that'll let you lock and unlock it using Siri voice commands. All of those will expand the Assure's smart features, but if that's the kind of thing that interests you, then you're better off just getting one of several other smart locks that include those sort of smarts from the get-go (and which don't ask you to pay extra for them). In general, almost all of those competing locks make more sense than the Assure does.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yale Assure smart lock looks like the gadget that it is, which might not be ideal if you're looking for something inconspicuous that won't advertise the fact that you have disposable income to spend on things like Bluetooth deadbolts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from adding in nodes on the bottom of the lock that'll let you power it with a 9V battery if the juice ever runs out, the Assure borrows  \t \tthe exact same build that we've seen from Yale's smart locks for years now. Either the team at Yale is extremely pleased with that design, or they haven't bothered to put any thought into refining it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter would be a mistake given how competitive the smart lock category is getting. Just look at the Assure's closest rival,  \t \tan upcoming keyless smart lock from Kwikset called the Obsidian. It features a modern, minimalist design and a slightly smaller interior footprint than the Assure, too. I know which one I'd rather bolt to my front door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installing the Assure is simple enough, requiring only a screwdriver, some measuring tape and about 20 minutes of your time. That said, as with all smart locks,  \t \tyou'll want to make sure that your door is properly aligned before buying one. If you need to push or pull on the doorknob in order to turn the lock smoothly, then that's something you'll need to fix. You'll also want to make sure that the hole in your doorframe is deep enough for the entire deadbolt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for your phone, you'll need an Android device running Android 4.1 or later, or an Apple device running at least iOS 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the lock is installed, you'll jump right into the app to pair it with your phone and start assigning codes and managing access. You can create up to 12 codes for multiple users, then track who's coming and going in the app's history section. If you want, you can set time-specific access for certain users -- a code that only works on a certain day at a certain time for your dog-sitter, for instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app also lets you create and send out \"digital keys\" that let you unlock the door with a single tap. At least, sort of.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the app installed and the digital key accepted, you'll need to pull out your phone and either rotate it 90 degrees or tap a button on the app's homescreen,   then tap the bottom left corner of the lock's touchpad. No, I don't know why you wouldn't just keep your phone in your pocket and use your code, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "That \"Twist N' Go\" rotation mechanism for activating your digital key was a bit clunky when I tested it out. I wasn't always able to get it to work reliably, often needing to fling my phone into the landscape orientation two or three times before it'd activate.\n",
      "\n",
      "By comparison, tapping the \"Activate Keys\" button on the app's homescreen worked like a charm -- but again, how is this any more convenient than using the touchpad like normal?\n",
      "\n",
      "To make matters worse, you only get five of those digital keys. After that, each one costs you $1.99. It's not the biggest deal if you don't need to share access with a lot of people (and it's about what you'd pay to make a copy of a key at a hardware store), but I still think it's a mistakenly stingy strategy (and certainly stingier than the Kwikset Kevo, for which you only pay for scheduled keys, and August, which doesn't charge at all).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: Expensive smart locks shouldn't charge their owners for the convenience of using them as intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other big problem is that there's really nothing else that the app does aside from letting you manage access codes or use a digital key at your door. You can't see the current status of the lock, for instance, so if you're lying in bed and can't remember whether or not you locked the door, the app won't help you.\n",
      "\n",
      "That leads us right to one last omission, and it's a biggie. The app won't let you lock or unlock the door from afar, even if you're within Bluetooth range. Like the finicky Twist N' Go feature, I'm sure that this is a result of Yale erring on the side of security rather than convenience, but it's still a bit of a head-scratcher given that remote locking and unlocking is pretty much a standard feature for connected deadbolts at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of what I've written here adds up to a $200 smart lock with underwhelming smarts -- and as a result, one that you probably won't use that much differently from a plain old dumb lock. You can pay an extra $50 for a Z-Wave or ZigBee module that'll let you connect the Assure lock with a smart home platform like Wink or SmartThings, or, starting in April, pay an extra $75 for a module that'll make the lock compatible with Apple HomeKit and let you control it using Siri commands -- but why not spend less on a smart lock that offers those integrations straight out of the box?\n",
      "\n",
      "If that's what you're after, Yale's own Z-Wave and ZigBee \"Real Living\" touchscreen deadbolts will do the trick, and for HomeKit, you could go with the Kwikset Premis, the Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt or the August Smart Lock. If you want a convenience upgrade, the Kwikset Kevo's touch-to-unlock smarts put the Assure's Twist N' Go feature to complete shame. All of those competitors will cost less than the Assure plus a module, and all of them are better reviewed, too. I wouldn't pick the Assure over any of them.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Half of house fires in the US start because something goes awry during cooking. A Wi-Fi-enabled device wants to curb those accidents by managing the power that goes to your stove and keeping an eye on you while you cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $495 iGuardStove Intelligent automatically shuts off your stove if you leave your cooking unattended thanks to a two-part system of a power box and motion detector. And the built-in Wi-Fi can help keep you posted online about how often the system has to shut down off your stove and send you alerts if it's happening a little too often.\n",
      "\n",
      "The product has its shortcomings, including the absence of a mobile app (the company said it's on its way) and a cost that makes it out of reach for a lot of people. But it's useful if you need an extra set of eyes in the kitchen of someone who may forget that they're cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iGuardStove is a simple device that smartens up your electric range with little effort on your part. You plug the iGuardStove's power box into into your wall and plug your range into the power box. You connect the box to a control panel that has a built-in motion sensor and mount that panel beneath an upper kitchen cabinet next to your range (or in a place that's not directly over the stovetop).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've started to cook something on a burner or in the oven and step out of the motion detector's range for more than 5 minutes, the iGuardStove will put your range into standby mode so that your food stops cooking. The device will turn your range back on if you step back into the motion detector's view within 30 minutes -- if you take longer, you have to press the reset button on the iGuardStove's control panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can adjust all of these settings in your online account or directly on the control panel (a tricky feat thanks to some pretty small fonts). There's also a manual mode you can enable on the control panel if you need to cook something for a longer period of time and don't want your oven to shut down. And the child lock mode will require you to press a button on the control panel before the iGuardStove lets your oven come on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where the Wi-Fi comes in: You connect the iGuardStove to your home's Wi-Fi network, and the device will begin to keep a digital record of how many times you've turned on the oven and how often the iGuardStove shut off your stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iGuardStove also sends you email alerts if it's turned off your range five or more times in 24 hours (you'll also get an email if someone presses an emergency button on the control panel or if the iGuardStove loses connection). The emails, which came into my inbox almost immediately after numerous tests, could provide a caregiver with valuable information on how often a loved one in a different home forgets to turn off the stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iGuardStove's makers have other models of the device, including a $395 Smart version without Wi-Fi and an Intelligent model for gas ranges. It will also work with Wi-Fi-enabled ovens that you can turn on remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it isn't just geared toward the easily distracted. Its manufacturers say the device would work well in homes of people with physical disabilities or aging adults who still live in their homes. The iGuardStove also sends email alerts if it has had to automatically shut off the stove five or more times in 24 hours. This is a good feature if you are worried about a loved one who doesn't live in the same home as you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iGuardStove delivers on its promise to stop cooking if you step away from your stove for too long. Once you turn on a burner or begin to preheat the oven, \"Protection Enabled\" pops up on the control panel's LCD display to let you know it's keeping an eye on you. The timer begins to count down after you leave the oven's range (which is about 10 feet).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you leave the default shut-off setting at 5 minutes, the iGuardStove will begin to beep loudly to warn you that it will turn off your oven if you don't get back in range soon. Your range goes into a standby if you don't return -- technically, it's still on (for example, the convection fan in the oven on which I tested the iGuardStove kept operating), but all of the heating elements shut down until you return.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are drawbacks to the iGuardStove. There isn't a mobile app for the product yet, which seems like a feature that would be a given on a Wi-Fi-enabled device. The company says it has an app coming for both iOS and Android later in 2017, but it's not live right now. A promised temperature detection feature that can sense both high and low temps also isn't live yet. And $495 is a lot of money -- you can find stoves that cost around that price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iGuardStove works well in sensing when you use your oven and when you walk away. It could give you some peace of mind if you can afford it. If not, keep an eye on products like the Inirv React, a less expensive but similar system that fits onto your burner knobs and detects smoke along with fire.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When standard fixed-angle security cameras don't cover enough ground, pan/tilt models make smart alternatives -- they raise, lower and rotate to capture more of a room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $80 Ezviz Mini 360 Plus has a 340-degree panning angle and an 80-degree tilting angle that you can either adjust manually or set to \"auto-tracking\" mode to follow motion activity for you. It also works with  \t \tIFTTT and comes with local as well as optional cloud storage for an additional fee. The Mini 360 Plus has limited availability in the UK and isn't currently sold in Australia; the price converts to roughly £65/AU$105 at the current exchange rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the Mini 360 Plus wasn't particularly good at following motion activity -- one of its core features. I'd look instead to the $150  \t \tZmodo Pivot for a true 360 cam that tracks activity without stumbling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ezviz's Mini 360 Plus looks nice enough. It's a smallish adapter-dependent orb that you can install and connect anywhere in your home over Wi-Fi. It also comes with an Ethernet port if you want to tether it directly to your router. This model has a relatively narrow 92-degree diagonal field of view, but its 340-degree panning angle and 80-degree tilting angle allow you to see much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get started, download the Ezviz app on your Android or iPhone gadget of choice, then follow the step-by-step tutorial to get the camera up and running. I already had an Ezviz account from testing out the $70 fixed-angle  \tEzviz Mini, but the configuration process took less than 10 minutes from start to finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ezviz app isn't as streamlined as I'd like. You really have to poke around to find the settings and other features you're searching for. It also looks dated and is in definite need of a design refresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unfortunately extends to the app's overall usability, particularly when you're trying to manually pan or tilt the camera. Open the camera's live feed and select the arrow icon on the far left. From there, select the Pan/Tilt option.\n",
      "\n",
      "This takes you to a seemingly blank half of the screen, but tap it and an arrow will appear. The odd thing is that you don't have a lot of control over which arrow appears first -- selecting the top of the screen, for instance, might engage the left arrow, sending the camera in the wrong direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera's rotations are also a little noisy -- not ideal for a discreet device like a security camera.\n",

      "In addition to its pan and tilt functions, the Mini 360 Plus also offers:\n",
      "\n",
      "I set up an IFTTT rule that connected the Ezviz camera to the   Ecobee3 thermostat installed at the CNET Smart Home -- whenever the Ezviz cam detected activity, the Ecobee3's settings changed. You can also connect smart lights and other compatible smart home devices to the Mini 360 Plus through IFTTT. Find out more here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mini 360 Plus has solid HD live streaming in both day and night mode. I also had a couple of (mostly) clear conversations using the app's two-way talk function, but its motion detection and related auto-tracking features fell short.\n",
      "\n",
      "I received consistent notifications whenever the camera detected movement. The problem is, it also detected activity when the only movement was a shadow shifting in the light. At first I thought this might be due to its motion sensitivity setting, but the camera's default setting sits right in the middle between no motion detection and very high detection sensitivity. At this setting, phantom alerts shouldn't be an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its auto-tracking feature was disappointing, too. When I walked slowly in front of the camera's field of view, it tracked me pretty well. But it struggled when I walked at a slightly faster pace, to the extent that it regularly gave up and stopped following me. Zmodo's Pivot does a much better job tracking activity, likely due to its 360 degrees of built-in motion sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "80 bucks is an excellent price for a home security camera, but that still isn't enough to recommend the Ezviz Mini 360 Plus. Yes, it's a fine live streaming device, but its core function -- 360-degree panning -- has serious limitations. I'd opt for   Ezviz's less expensive Mini cam instead if you simply want an affordable live streaming camera.

Like the $180 Amazon Echo, Alexa's primary device, Brilliant's goal appears to be making it easier for the whole family to control the smart home. Instead of relying on the apps on an individual's phone, anyone in the house will have equal access to the devices connected to the Brilliant switch.\n",

      "The Brilliant Control will fit panels with up to four light switches, although you'll need to pay more to cover bigger panels. It'll let you turn the lights on or off and dim them as well.

At launch, Brilliant will work with an impressive variety of platforms:\n",
      "\n",
      "You can scroll up and down on the panel to adjust your Nest Learning Thermostat's temperature, or use Ring with Brilliant's built-in camera and microphone to talk with the delivery person at your door. And if you install more than one Brilliant panel, you can use them as intercoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brilliant has an impressive list of features, but we had problems controlling the similar $90 Wink Relay when it came out a couple of years ago. And if you don't have a lot of smart home gear, Lutron switches will add smarts to your fixtures for less -- $190 nets you a starter kit with two switches -- while still working with Alexa and Apple's Homekit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Brilliant Control starts at $200, which is a little pricey given that Wink's competitive product is now on sale for $70 on Amazon. Combine that with Amazon's mini Echo -- the $50 Echo Dot -- for voice commands, and you still won't reach Brilliant's off-the-shelf price. But you can preorder the Brilliant Control now for a more tempting special price of $150.\n",

      "Philips 60W Equivalent SceneSwitch LED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I review a product, I typically enjoy the challenge of combing through the nuance of its strengths and weaknesses to come up with a concrete buying recommendation. Unfortunately, there is no such nuance to comb with the Philips SceneSwitch LED, because it is, quite simply, a very, very good light bulb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's make this easy with some bullet points, shall we?\n",
      "\n",
      "The only real problem with these bulbs is that you can't use them with conventional dimmer switches -- but that's sort of the point. The SceneSwitch feature lets you dial the light down without need for any extra dimming hardware. Unlike normal three-way LEDs, the SceneSwitch bulbs will change settings with any lamp or fixture, and they cost less than most of those standard three-way LEDs, too. No nuance necessary -- these are some of the best non-dimmable light bulbs money can buy, period.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"SceneSwitch\" is a pretty killer feature for these otherwise basic bulbs. Each one comes with three distinct settings, and you can switch between them simply by turning the bulb off and back on again (they'll stay on your selected setting if the bulb is off for more than 5 seconds or so). It's similar to what you'll get from a common three-way bulb, except you don't need a three-way lamp in order to use them. Any old lamp or light switch will do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other distinction between the two is that common three-way bulbs tend to offer 100W, 60W, and 40W brightness settings, while the SceneSwitch LEDs offer the rough equivalent of 60W, 40W, and nightlight settings. For me, being able to dial a bulb all the way down to minimum brightness is about as appealing as being able to crank it up to the 100W level, so this seems like a pretty even trade-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "You get three options with the SceneSwitch LED. First is a yellowy, soft white bulb that offers those three brightness settings for about $8. Second is a bluish-white, daylight version with the same brightness settings for about $9. Last is a combo bulb that offers a 60W equivalent soft white setting, a 60W equivalent daylight setting, and the soft white nightlight setting. It also costs $9. It's worth noting that all three are less expensive than the typical three-way LED, most of which sell for at least $12.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obvious appeal here is for lamps and fixtures that can't dim down on their own. With the SceneSwitch LED, you've got an easy, affordable option that'll let you enjoy dimmed-down light wherever you like without need for any extra dimming hardware or smarts. The combo bulb has some extra appeal in that you can switch it from an energizing daylight tone during the day to a relaxing soft white glow in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three versions of the bulb offer multiple brightness settings that you can switch between by turning the bulb off and back on -- like a three-way bulb you can use anywhere. All three are even brighter than stated at their brightest settings. All three did an excellent job managing heat build-up, which can affect light output in some bulbs. All three come with a 5-year warranty (and, as of right now, you can double that to 10 years by registering the bulb online within 60 days of purchase). All three cost less than $9, which means that each one will pay for itself in energy savings in just over a year if you're upgrading from an incandescent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SceneSwitch LEDs have more than a nifty feature going for them. They're also very decent light bulbs in their own right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with brightness. All three SceneSwitch LEDs claim to put out 800 lumens at their brightest setting, a number that would put them right on par with a 60W incandescent. In my tests, all three bulbs exceeded that number, meaning that they're putting out plenty of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as you'd expect from an LED, each one is efficient, too. At 9 watts from the soft white and daylight SceneSwitch bulbs and 9.5 watts from the combo bulb, each one is using just a fraction of the energy that a 60W incandescent would use. Swap a SceneSwitch bulb in for an incandescent like that, and you'll knock an average of about 6 bucks off your yearly energy bill. At that rate, the SceneSwitch LED would pay for itself in a little over a year, then continue saving you money for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many years? Almost 14, per the stated lifespan. Philips backs that claim up with a five-year warranty for each SceneSwitch LED. Register your purchase online within 60 days, and they'll double the coverage term to 10 years. That's a good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also impressed with how well each SceneSwitch LED managed heat build up. Just like your phone, your laptop, or most other electronics, LED performance will decline as things get hot. That's why LEDs typically include heat sinks, convection vents, or some other means of keeping heat at bay. With the SceneSwitch bulbs, those heat sinks did a fantastic job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most LEDs typically lose a little bit of their initial brightness in the first hour or so as the bulb heats up. Then, the brightness levels off as the heat sink kicks in. The average LED will lose about 15 percent of its initial brightness due to heat build-up, but the SceneSwitch LEDs all did better. The combo bulb lost 11.5 percent, the daylight bulb lost 9.5 percent, and the soft white bulb? Just a  5 percent dip -- one of the best results I've seen from any LED I've ever tested. That makes these bulbs a good pick for enclosed fixtures, where heat gets trapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one spot where SceneSwitch bulbs are just so-so is color quality. To my eye, all three options were on par with the average LED, which is to say that things look fine, but a little yellowy. For something that does a better job of making the colors in your home pop, you might consider something like  the GE Reveal LED, which filters out that excess yellow light -- but keep in mind that bulbs like that often won't be quite as bright as you'd like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among non-dimmable LED bulbs, the Philips SceneSwitch LEDs have a secret weapon that can't be beat: they dim. There's nothing else below 10 bucks that'll let you dial the lights down without dimming hardware, and on top of that, they're just darned good bulbs in their own right. They're an easy Editors' Choice-winner in my eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't care about that SceneSwitch feature (or about dimmability in general), then you can save a couple of bucks by going with a standard non-dimmable option like the GE Bright Stik LED or Philips' own non-dimmable 60W equivalent. And, if you're looking for a bulb you can use with a dimmer switch, then you'll want to go with one of our top dimmable LED picks. But for everyone else, the SceneSwitch LEDs are definitely worth some strong consideration in your local lighting aisle.\n",
      "GE 60W Equivalent HD Light LED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I imagine that a lot of shoppers will be asking themselves what the heck \"HD Light\" is the next time they stroll through the lighting aisle -- and for that, we have GE to thank. That's because \"HD Light\" is the new branding you'll find on the venerable manufacturer's latest LED lineup, which includes bulbs of all kinds of shapes, sizes, wattages and color temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, there is no such thing as \"HD Light,\" but the idea that GE wants to convey here is superior light quality. And to be fair, some of these bulbs -- most notably the \"Reveal\" LEDs, with their high color rendering scores -- offer light quality that's noticeably better than average. But none of them are perfect, and most fall closer to mediocre in terms of brightness and dimming performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, with all-around acceptable specs and with prices on regular, A-shaped bulbs starting at $8 for a two-pack, GE's lineup of HD Light LEDs are a decent enough value to warrant consideration, especially given what they can do for the color quality in your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "GE offers three standard 60-watt replacement options in the HD Light lineup. The first is the \"Relax\" LED, which casts a warm, candle-like glow designed to help you wind down in the evening. The second is the \"Refresh\" LED, a daylight-tinted bulb intended to help you feel more focused and energetic during the day. Last up is the \"Reveal\" LED, which sticks to years of GE Reveal branding to promise better color quality in rooms where it might matter -- the kitchen, perhaps, or maybe a living room with a lot of colorful decor.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's nothing inherently unique about any of them -- no smarts, no gimmicky lighting tricks and no unusual designs. These are pretty plain old light bulbs, save for the fact that they're high-efficiency LEDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how efficient are we talking? Each bulb draws 10.5 watts, or 17.5 percent of what a standard 60-watt incandescent would use. That incandescent will add about $7.20 per year to your energy bill if you use it for an average of three hours per day. By the same metrics, any of these three GE HD Light LEDs will add roughly $1.26 to that annual figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a savings of $5.94 per year, per bulb, meaning that each one will easily pay for itself within 12 months, then continue saving you money for years on out. Unlike incandescents, which will burn out after about a year of use, these HD Light LEDs promise an expected lifespan of 13.7 years, and come backed by a five-year warranty. Replace that incandescent and use GE's LED for its entire lifespan, and you're looking at a total energy savings of $81.38 -- and that's just for one bulb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, those savings aren't unique to GE, or to any other LED manufacturer. LEDs are just inherently more efficient than any other readily available lighting option. All of them will save you money if you're upgrading from incandescent bulbs (or even fluorescent ones, for that matter). To judge an LED's real value against its competitors, you have to factor performance in, as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "GE's on somewhat shakier ground, here. Let's start with brightness. Though they all came in well within the margin of error, none of the bulbs tested quite as bright as their stated lumen counts. This isn't much of a problem for the \"Relax\" and \"Refresh\" LEDs, both of which finished close enough to 800 lumens to qualify as perfectly decent 60-watt replacement bulbs. But look at the lumen count for that \"Reveal\" LED -- just 554. The box brands the LED as a 60-watt replacement, but the light it puts out is closer to the 450 lumens you'd expect from a 40-watt bulb. That's a recipe for disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason the thing is so dim is because the plastic bulb includes a special filter that blocks some of the light from the yellow part of the visible light spectrum. You can see that blocked light in the form of that W-shaped dip in the graph on the right above. Blocking those bits of the middle of the spectrum keeps the dominant yellow tones from overpowering things, and does, in fact, help the bulb make the colors in your home look richer and more authentic -- but it also means that the bulb is putting out less light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simple fix would have been to bump the wattage up a little bit to help make up for the lost light, but GE didn't do that here. That's fine -- but continuing to call the Reveal LED a 60-watt replacement is not. GE's engineers tell me that they plan on addressing this shortcoming with the next generation of Reveal bulbs, which they claim will offer a higher lumen count than this version while drawing less energy. To me, that sounds like a bulb worth waiting for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the current-gen Reveal LED was, as expected, very good at rendering vivid, accurate colors in my tests, along with very clean shades of white free from the dingy yellow tints that you'll get with most soft white bulbs. These are subtle things, to be sure, but to some, they matter quite a bit. If that includes you, then the Reveal LED deserves a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, though they weren't quite the color rendering standouts that the Reveal LED was, the Relax and Refresh LEDs still did surprisingly well in my tests, too. Despite the extra hit of yellow light, they both rendered colors that, to my eye, looked at least a little bit better than what you'll get from the average LED. Point GE.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing I look for in my tests is dimmer compatibility. All three of these bulbs are dimmable, but none of them dimmed down any lower than 10 percent on any of the switches I tested them on. I also caught all three of them flickering a bit more than the average LED when I filmed them in slow motion. That sort of flicker is too fast to be noticed by the naked eye, but some people are more sensitive to strobing than others, so it's something worth being aware of.\n",
      "\n",
      "I give these bulbs a passing grade, but not a full-throated recommendation. All three offer energy savings and noticeably good color quality, but they also come with dimming performance that's mediocre at best. The Reveal LED might be the most appealing of the three thanks to the way it filters out excess yellow light for cleaner-looking whites and richer colors, but at just 554 lumens, it isn't bright enough to justify calling itself a 60-watt replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, with prices starting at $8 for a two-pack of Relax LEDs, there's some good value to be had here. If you aren't using dimmer switches, and if you don't mind the brightness hit that comes with the Reveal LED, they're a perfectly fine choice for basic household use.\n",
      "WinkBeds CoolControl\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you and your partner disagree on the \"right\" sleep temperature, startup WinkBeds might have a solution. Its new CoolControl mattress and base, now available in the US at WinkBeds.com, comes with dual temperature zones. Prices for the set start at $2,500 for a twin XL and go up to $4,300 for a California king.\n",
      "\n",
      "CoolControl isn't currently sold internationally, but the California king's price converts to roughly £3,415 or AU$5,675 at the current exchange rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to Sleep Number's 360 Bed, CoolControl comes with a related Android and iPhone app for making manual adjustments or programming it to auto-adjust the temp for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to WinkBeds, CoolControl's radiant heat tech was developed with Gentherm, a company that manufactures seat warmers and coolers for cars. Apparently, you'll be able to separately adjust each side to 30 degrees above and 15 degrees below the ambient temperature in the bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if your partner (ahem) covertly turns the heat down into the 60s, you can still warm up your side of the bed with CoolControl. This could end up being a smart energy saver over time, too, since WinkBeds claims its plug-in system uses \"less electricity than a table lamp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The main downside is that there's nothing else smart about CoolControl. It doesn't integrate with any products from other smart home manufacturers. There's no voice control component -- \"Alexa, set my side of the bed to 72 degrees!\" -- or any other integration with connected platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, WinkBeds' CoolControl is at the forefront of a growing trend in sleep tech -- advanced temperature control. And I'm interested to see if this sort of feature continues to show up in other smart beds. So far, Sleep Number's new 360 Bed is among its closest competitors, but its dual-sided temperature control is limited to heating the foot of the bed only.\n",
      "TP-Link LB130 Multicolor Wi-Fi LED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a growing list of lights that you can control by talking to Amazon's Alexa, the virtual AI assistant housed within the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers. Among them are a couple of devices from TP-Link, which has emerged as a decent budget option for Alexa-compatible gadgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those options include the TP-Link LB130, a color-changing Wi-Fi bulb that costs $50. It's less of a bargain than TP-Link's  \tsmart plugs and non-color-changing smart bulbs, but it's still priced 10 bucks below what you'd spend on the comparable Lifx LED, a color-changing Wi-Fi bulb that also works with Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Lifx, the TP-Link LB130 is a bright, efficient bulb that offers full color and color temperature control through a companion app for Android and iOS devices. And, also like Lifx, you don't need a hub because it uses its own built-in Wi-Fi radio to connect directly with your home's router.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the LB130 is not as well-featured or well-connected to third parties as Lifx and Philips Hue are. And, unlike Lifx, which offers its own custom Alexa skill, you can't ask Alexa to change the LB130's color, nor can you trigger color changes using outside services like IFTTT. There are just a few too many compromises here for me to recommend it over Lifx or Hue, even if it costs a little less.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nice thing about smart bulbs like the LB130 that use Wi-Fi as opposed to something like ZigBee is that you don't need to plug any sort of hub into your router in order to translate their signal. You just screw the thing in, turn it on, and pair with it in TP-Link's \"Kasa\" app.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do so, you'll follow the app's instructions and connect with the Wi-Fi signal that the bulb puts out when you first turn it on.  Then, you'll jump back into the app, where TP-Link will tether the bulb back to your home network. From there, you'll be able to turn the bulb on and off, dim it up and down, or change its color and color temperature using the app's controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to pair it up with Alexa, just open the smart home section of the Alexa app, tap \"Get More Smart Home Skills\" and search for the Kasa skill. When you enable it, it'll ask you to provide your login info -- once you do, you'll be able to ask Alexa to scan for the bulb and add it to the list of devices she can control.\n",
      "\n",
      "From there, Alexa can turn the bulb on and off or dim it up and down. You can also group it with other Alexa-compatible lights to control everything at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't, however, ask Alexa to change the color. For that, you'll need to use the app, which is a significant disappointment. After all, you aren't buying this bulb if color control isn't at least somewhat important to you, not when the non-color-changing version costs 30 bucks less. And it's not like Alexa-enabled color changes are impossible -- Lifx made it happen using a custom Alexa skill that lets her switch to any shade you like, provided you tack \"tell Lifx\" onto the start of your command.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the TP-Link LB130 is an Alexa-compatible color-changing bulb that won't let Alexa change the colors -- and that's not the only instance where the features come up short.\n",
      "\n",
      "On paper, there's plenty of utility packed into that app, with scheduling, energy tracking, and even a \"Circadian Mode\" that'll automatically adjust the bulb's brightness and color temperature throughout the day. But it feels like TP-Link was more concerned with checking features off of a list than with actually executing them well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the scheduling tool. It works well enough, letting you program the bulb to turn on or off or change colors at specific times of day, but there's no option for selecting a custom fade duration like you'll get with Lifx. That might sound like a little thing, but slow fades are the key to simulating a sunrise to wake you up in the morning, or creating subtle visual reminders that a deadline is drawing near. You can't do anything like that with this bulb.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the energy tracking front, the app will let you keep tabs on how much you're using each bulb on a per-day average, along with the average energy savings over a standard 60W incandescent. I suppose that's all well and good, but I'd have preferred a more graphical interface here instead of just a bunch of numbers. At the very least, the app could have translated the kilowatt-hours (kWh) saved into actual dollars and cents. It didn't do any of that, though. As a result, the feature feels arbitrary and tacked-on.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the Circadian Mode, it's a very simple way to automate the bulb to switch between hot, bluish-white daylight tones during the day and warmer, more candle-like yellows in the evening. There's no way to customize it, though, and that's a problem since the whole point of circadian lighting is to help you sleep better at night and feel more energized during the day. At a minimum, you really ought to be able to tell the bulb when you typically wake up and go to bed to better tailor those automated changes to your normal routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most damning of all is the bulb's lack of connections outside of Alexa. There's no IFTTT channel, no compatibility with Apple HomeKit or Google Home, and no direct support for third-party controllers like SmartThings or Wink. Without those kinds of integrations, it's a lot tougher to put those colors to good use in your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underwhelming features aside, the LB130 did impress me when I tested it in our lighting lab. The bulb calls itself a 60W replacement and claims a maximum brightness of 800 lumens, but it scored significantly higher, with the default setting clocking in at 896 lumens at full brightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colors came in nice and bright, too, besting Philips Hue's newest bulbs at almost every turn and even keeping up with the category-leading Lifx LED. Color accuracy was strong for the most part, too, though the green and cyan tones weren't as richly saturated as I'd have liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of efficiency, the bulb draws 11 watts at peak brightness, which makes it good for a little more than 80 lumens per watt. That's a better-than-average result, and perhaps a means of justifying the bulb's expense. Use it to replace a standard 60W incandescent and you'll knock about $6 per year off of your energy bill, assuming you're running it at full brightness for an average of three hours per day. Those energy savings will cover the cost of the bulb outright after eight and a half years, which is less than half of the bulb's stated lifespan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nah. At $50, the TP-Link LB130 doesn't do anything to change the fact that color-changing smart bulbs are still annoyingly expensive. And though it costs $10 less than the comparable third-gen Lifx LED, it comes with too many compromises to earn my recommendation. If I'm splurging, I'd rather spend the extra $10 and get better features, better Alexa controls and a better slate of smart home partners.\n",
      "LG Smart Security\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The once intense division between professional security firms like ADT and standalone DIY products is gone, and LG's Smart Security ($149.00 at Amazon.com) Wireless Camera is proof. LG's Smart Security is a $200 all-in-one security system with 1080p live streaming, an Alexa Skill, its own Z-Wave hub and optional ADT services.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're a renter who wants ADT's professional monitoring without being locked in to a contract, LG's Smart Security Wireless Camera is a reasonable choice. If access to ADT isn't a priority for you, Piper's $280 all-in-one NV system is a better bet. The NV has a wider field of view, a simpler app interface and, best of all, free video clip storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, you had to pick between a professional firm or a DIY security setup for your home. There was absolutely no overlap between the two sides, and it fostered a lot of industry competition and innovation. Slowly, we began to see professional firms began to work with and offer accessories from other manufacturers, like when ADT integrated with Nest or Vivint partnered with Yale locks and Amazon Alexa. Select DIY systems like Scout and SimpliSafe began to offer their own professional monitoring services, too. You could install the systems yourself (if you wanted to), but you could also opt into advanced services for an added fee on a contract-free subscription plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ADT's Canopy service is an entirely new service. Canopy is an app, an API and a contract-free subscription service that bridges the gap between security firms and DIY products like never before. LG's Smart Security Wireless Camera is the first all-in-one security system to offer such an integration and it marks an important shift in the market. That doesn't mean it's right for everyone, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a look at the LG Smart Security devices versus its competition:\n",
      "\n",
      "The ADT integration really is the main thing that sets LG's Smart Security apart from either the Piper NV or Canary. Otherwise, it has a smaller field of view, no free cloud storage option, a unique but somewhat odd-looking design, and a comparatively clunkier app interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the app front, the initial configuration is about what you'd expect: Create an account, verify your email address, plug in the device (the app recognizes it over Bluetooth), enter your Wi-Fi details and wait a few moments for it to connect. It should take less than 10 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the Piper NV, the LG Smart Security has temperature and humidity sensors in addition to a standard motion sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The live feed looks comparable to Piper and Canary's 1080p HD, and the app's activity log updates every time the motion sensor detects activity (it knows the difference between general motion activity and someone picking up or \"tampering\" with the camera). It also updates if the temperature or humidity changes. Motion and tamper detection were all extremely responsive, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's one thing that's kind of wonky about this app, though. You have to manually create the alerts you want to receive. This happens in the app's \"Activities\" tab. Click the plus sign in the top right corner to name your new activity and create a custom rule. This is great when you've added Z-Wave devices to the system and you want your camera to record a video clip.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, I paired the Aeon Labs Aeotec Water Sensor using the Z-Wave \"Pair Device\" section in the app and created an Activity that would send me an alert if the Aeotec detects water. I also created an Activity so I could say, \"Alexa, record a video clip\" any time I wanted a video clip on demand. It successfully recorded a clip and sent me an alert every time I ran the sensor under water.\n",
      "\n",
      "But manually creating alerts doesn't make sense for motion. Motion detection and motion-related notifications are standard issue for pretty much every DIY camera I've ever tested. Having to build that alert yourself is counterintuitive to the extent that I thought the app was malfunctioning. ADT Canopy will send you motion alerts; you just have to build the rule first.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also a \"Devices\" tab in the app that's a little clunky. Here's where Z-Wave devices you've paired with the app show up, such as the Aeotec flood sensor. It lets you assign products to specific rooms, so the flood sensor is connected to the Kitchen, whereas lights could be added to the Basement, Kid's Bedroom, or anywhere you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this page also automatically lists the LG Smart Security's camera, motion, temperature and humidity sensors as individual devices. Since the camera and all of the sensors are part of a single device, it feels a little odd/unnecessary to list them as devices here, especially since they can't exist in separate rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since LG's $200 Smart Security Wireless Camera doesn't offer free cloud storage, you'll have to pay at least $10 per month for ADT's 7-day event-based Canopy video clip storage. The monthly fee increases from there if you want 30-day clip storage and/or professional monitoring. If that's what you want, LG's Smart Security is a fine choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Piper and Canary offer free event-based cloud storage, comparable specs and better mobile apps. The $280 Piper NV also performs extremely well, has a wider 180-degree field of view and, like LG's Smart Security, comes with its own Z-Wave hub. Strongly consider the NV if you aren't sold on LG's Smart Security Wireless Camera.\n",
      "Teforia Infuser\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you're a tea fanatic, it's hard to justify the outrageous price tag of the almost $1,500 Teforia Infuser. Sure, the machine packs plenty of high-tech capabilities and hardware including both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth plus a mobile companion app. The Teforia is completely automated, and even scans RFID tags on its tea packs for precise brewing directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, while this opulent kitchen appliance does consistently create good cups of tea, simpler gadgets handle the job just as well and with more finesse and flexibility. Worse, they cost a fraction of the price, with even the premium $219 Breville One-Touch Tea Maker and Espro P5 ($78 with tea filter) coming in far below the Teforia's monumental expense. All that adds up to a foolhardy proposition, and one you should pass up unless you get money for nothing or grow it on trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't deny it, the Teforia Infuser is a pretty appliance. Measuring 13 inches tall by 8.3 inches wide and reaching back 12.3 inches deep, the machine is about the size of your average coffee maker. Its shape is blocklike as well, but that's where the resemblance ends. On the Teforia's face is a sphere, clear save for white sections on its top and bottom, that serves as a steeping chamber for tea leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The small sphere, called \"the infusion globe,\" is held in place by two arms -- one above and one below. Under the lower arm sits a slim carafe for collecting brewed tea. The majority of its body is transparent, too, and the carafe's mouth slides neatly into a slot within this arm. There it hangs suspended in air above the bottom of the machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like this visual effect, and with a chassis constructed of smooth, white plastic and sculpted in gentle curves, the Infuser is attractive enough. The surfaces of the gadget are also easy to clean, especially with the included black microfiber cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But still -- plastic? If I were unaware of the Teforia's atmospheric price I would never guess the appliance was so expensive. For instance, the Ratio Eight luxury coffee makers ($495 to $595) look and feel a great deal more impressive. They're also hand-built in Portland, Oregon, using posh materials such as wood, nickel and steel. Even the steel and glass frame of the $250 Breville One-Touch is more alluring. Sorry, but at this price, plastic doesn't cut it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brewing tea with the Teforia Infuser is an odd experience. First of all, the machine has no physical buttons or controls of any kind, and no screen for displaying info. Instead, cryptic symbols appear on the front face of the Infuser to indicate its status, such as a bubbling globe icon when it's brewing and a carafe when your tea is ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "These symbols are formed by light shining through the Teforia's smooth plastic surface. As a result they appear faint and a bit blurry, unlike the clarity of traditional LED lights and LCD screens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you make tea, you'll first fill the water tank (68 to 70 ounces) in the back of the appliance. It's sturdy and has a metal handle for easy transport. The reservoir is equipped with a water filter, but not a maximum fill line, strangely enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "To use one of the Teforia SIPS (Selective Infusion Profile System) tea packs, just tap its paper label against the RFID reader on the top of the machine. This action theoretically tells the Infuser details about the tea it's about to brew and how to brew it. Next, peel off the pack label, pour its contents into the globe and confirm that the globe and carafe are locked in place. Lastly, hit the circular light on the Teforia's base to begin tea infusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also use the infuser to brew tea that isn't in SIPS packs, though you need to use the mobile app to do so (it's available on iOS and soon for Android). The app asks about the tea you'd like to prepare and sets up a custom brewing profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teforia claims its Infuser makes tea using proprietary recipes that were \"crafted with tea masters and artisans\" and take \"dozens of variables\" into account, including infusion temperature. In the lab, however, we didn't see much difference in the Infuser's brewing from cup to cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether I told the Infuser to infuse black tea from a Teforia-branded Earl Grey pack, my own storebought leaves or a Teforia \"Hibiscus Song\" herbal blend, water inside the infusion globe never exceeded 186.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Brewing times were very similar too, though I did observe a range between 5 minutes (thin-cut black tea) and 6 minutes and 17 seconds (rolled pearl black tea leaves).\n",
      "\n",
      "The infusion process is fun to watch, though. Hot water drips over the tea leaves to fill the globe halfway. Next the machine pumps air into the mixture, which agitates it. Finally, water flows into the globe to fill it completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "After steeping for a moment, brewed tea is strained through a mesh filter inside the globe and falls into the waiting carafe. Within each brewing cycle this process is repeated three times, by the end of which the carafe should be full with about 12 ounces of liquid. Teforia calls these short steeping events \"micro infusions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Teforia further explained that these micro infusions are designed to unlock the pleasant flavor compounds inside tea leaves, plus caffeine, and leave the stringent tannins behind. The company also confirmed that the Infuser doesn't brew at the high temperatures traditional methods call for since it isn't necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tea I sampled from the appliance was good, though it didn't bowl me over with intense flavor. In fact, my favorite black tea blend, Royal Breakfast from Louisville Tea Company, tasted better brewed in the $78 Espro Press P5 than in the Teforia Infuser.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Teforia, I'd need to run something truly exceptional through the Infuser in order to really appreciate it -- something rare, handmade and close to $100 per pound. I'm no business mogul and don't have that sort of tea on hand (but then, neither am I the target buyer for a $1,500 teapot). Still, I can confirm that the Teforia Infuser brought out a little better flavor than usual from my $6-per-pound Tetley loose-leaf black tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely not. There are appliances that brew the sort of tea I prefer to drink with the same results. The $78 Espro P5 with tea filter and $219 Breville One-Touch Tea Maker spring to mind, both of which create cups of tea with adequate quality for my tastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if spending $1,499 is as painless for you as purchasing a pack of bubble gum, investing in a Teforia Infuser isn't the best use of your money. Instead, I suggest learning how to brew artisan tea by hand. Think of all that fancy tea you could get using the money you'll save.\n",
      "Canary Flex\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Canary's $199/£159 Flex definitely lives up to its name. Not only is this rechargeable, battery-powered indoor/outdoor security camera portable, its strong magnetic base and swiveling body design make it extremely easy to find the right viewing angle. The app is smartly designed, too, with an activity log of motion-related video clips and auto-adjusting Home and Away security modes tied to your phone's location.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are limited to 720p video for live streaming, and the Flex currently only works with Wink on the smart home compatibility side of things. But Canary says it's working on an IFTTT channel and, in future hardware, integrations with HomeKit, Apple's Siri-based smart home platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Factor in the Flex's many optional accessories, including a Verizon 4G LTE mount, and there are few standalone DIY security cameras that offer so many potential use cases. Look no further than the Canary Flex ($151.99 at Amazon.com) for an HD live streaming device that's truly flexible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Flex is Canary's second security camera, following a successful Indiegogo campaign for its inaugural all-in-one indoor security system back in 2013. But the home security market has changed quite a bit since then. Yes, indoor high-definition live streaming cameras are still important, but many companies are introducing models that can go from your living room to your backyard with minimal effort. Enter: the Canary Flex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a look at what the Flex can do versus the $200/£159 Logi Circle and the $250/£300 Netgear Arlo Pro:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the Logi Circle is indoor-only, has a short battery life and doesn't work with any smart home products from other manufacturers, it really can't compete with Canary's Flex or Netgear's Arlo Pro ($221.44 at Amazon.com). But, the competition gets a lot closer when you look at the Flex and the Arlo Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arlo Pro promises a longer battery life of \"up to six months\" compared with the Flex's two-month charge (Logi's lasted about four hours). After about a week of testing, the Netgear Arlo Pro's battery indicator still shows a full charge, while the Canary Flex is showing a slightly diminished battery around the 80 to 90 percent mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear's rechargeable indoor/outdoor camera also has a wider viewing angle and offers seven days of free cloud storage (as opposed to the Flex's 24 hours). You'll also get a web app with Netgear's camera, as well as integrations with IFTTT and Samsung SmartThings. The Flex's third-party integrations currently include Wink, although the team is working on potential IFTTT and Apple HomeKit support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, I prefer the Flex's app interface and its fast hub-free setup -- the Arlo Pro requires the installation of a rather large hub that you connect to your router during initial configuration. The hub does have a built-in 100-decibel siren, but that might not make a difference if your router is located in your basement or some other out-of-the-way location in your house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear sells its Arlo Pro cameras in one or multiunit kits with the hub (since this is a required accessory). The one camera kit costs $250 -- 50 bucks more than a standalone Canary Flex or Logi Circle.\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition to its easy hub-free installation, the Canary Flex is also very simple to use. To preserve battery power, you have to press the \"Watch Live\" button on the home page to see the live video feed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is also where you can check the quality of your Wi-Fi connection and view the status of your rechargeable battery. You can also sign up to receive notifications when your battery is getting low, as well as when it's fully charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Select \"View Timeline\" on the bottom of the same page to pull up a time stamped list with video clips of any activity detected by the Flex's built-in sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this worked very well, with only slight lag times and the occasional grainy image, likely due to a temporarily spotty Wi-Fi connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my favorite Flex feature relates to its auto-adjusting security modes. Canary's software taps into your location using your cellular signal, Wi-Fi and GPS info. After you enter the address where your Flex is located, the app will automatically switch among Home and Away modes for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also customize these modes manually and program Night mode separately based on your sleep schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, when it notices the whole family is away from home, the app should automatically switch to Away mode. That's when you'll receive activity-based alerts. And when the software believes someone is home, you can choose how you'd like to receive alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's easy to extend access to other family members, too. Simply select \"Settings,\" \"Members\" and \"Add a member.\" Enter in their name and email address and they'll get a message asking them to accept the invite, download the app and create their own account (which will link with your account and give them access to your Flex camera). The Flex's security modes worked well for me throughout testing and provided a layer of security beyond typical DIY cameras.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a live streaming HD security camera with a ton of installation freedom, I'd highly recommend the $199/£159 Canary Flex. This versatile camera is just as comfortable sitting on a living room table connected to a power adapter as it is mounted to your backyard fence, relying on rechargeable battery power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $250/£300 Netgear Arlo Pro is a reasonable alternative, but it costs more without adding much value. And, if you're just planning to keep your camera inside connected to a charger, you might also consider the $199 Nest Cam ($196.00 at Amazon.com) Indoor since it offers a lot of the same features as Flex, but bumps the resolution up to 1080p HD.\n",
      "Netgear Arlo Pro\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot to love about Netgear's $250/£300 Arlo Pro security camera. Its rechargeable battery is simpler to deal with than the original Netgear Arlo's expensive and hard-to-find CR123s. The Arlo Pro also adds in two-way audio so you can tell any unwelcome guests to get off your lawn, as well as receive audio alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, this indoor/outdoor DIY home security camera is essentially the same as the first-gen Arlo, which Netgear still sells for $180/£135. That's mostly a good thing, since Netgear nails the features category with seven days of free cloud storage, a wide-angle lens, a loud siren built-in to the Arlo Pro's next-gen Wi-Fi hub and compatibility with IFTTT and Samsung SmartThings platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arlo Pro is a solid choice, particularly for outdoor, scalable security since Netgear sells multicamera kits and the hub can help extend the camera's reach beyond that of your WiFi router. I'd also consider the $199/£159 Canary Flex, as it has similar features with a more streamlined hub-free design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arlo Pro shares a lot of similarities with the original Arlo camera. The main difference lies in the type of batteries Netgear uses. Instead of needing CR123 batteries to power a single Arlo camera, you get a single rechargeable battery with the Arlo Pro, designed to last for anywhere from four to six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear also improved the required hub accessory that comes with your Arlo Pro purchase. Not only does the router-connected hub help extend the Wi-Fi range for longer distance outdoor camera installs (around 200 feet when I tested it, although Netgear claims it has a \"300+ feet line of sight\" range), this updated version also has a built-in 100-decibel siren.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the related Android or iPhone Arlo app to program the siren to sound when the camera detects activity. The one hiccup is that the siren sounds from the hub, not from the cameras. So, if you have your cameras installed outside around the perimeter of your yard and the camera detects activity, the siren will only sound inside your house. 100 decibels is pretty loud, but it might not be strong enough to scare off someone lurking around outside preparing to steal your car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arlo Pro also adds in two-way audio via a built-in microphone and speaker so you can communicate with someone at your front door or tell your dog to stop chewing on your shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Canary Flex and the Logi Circle are two Netgear Arlo Pro competitors. Check out the chart below to compare their main features and specs:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arlo Pro has a definite advantage over both the Canary Flex and the Logi Circle in terms of features. Its rechargeable battery is supposed to last longer, it offers free 7-day event-based cloud storage and it works with IFTTT and SmartThings.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while I didn't test this camera over several months to fully explore its battery life, the battery indicator in the app is still showing that it's fully charged after roughly a week of testing. The Canary Flex is still showing a mostly full charge, but it's closer to 80 or 90 percent charged at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the Arlo Pro costs more than its competitors and some people won't want to deal with the added hassle of installing the related hub -- especially if they have no need for a Wi-Fi range extender.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that the Arlo Pro performed the same as Netgear's impressive first-gen Arlo camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Viewing the live feed was very simple, and I received prompt alerts related to any activity the camera detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the Arlo Pro's night-vision capabilities were disappointing compared to the Canary Flex. As you can see in the screenshot above, the Arlo Pro brightly illuminated the table it was sitting on, but everything in the background was still difficult to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canary's Flex had a much clearer night vision view, one that provided a clearer view of what was going on in the camera's field of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, the Arlo Pro performed very well. I particularly liked that the Arlo Pro had arm/disarm security modes similar to the Flex that updated automatically via a geofencing radius.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hub also did a decent job extending the camera's Wi-Fi range. I walked the camera roughly 350 feet away from the router and was unable to pull up the live feed. But as I walked back toward the router, the live feed began to work at around 200 feet away. That's a potential plus for anyone interested in installing these cameras beyond 150 feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just keep in mind that the hub's Wi-Fi range could vary depending on the type of router you have and the quality of your internet connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $250/£300 Netgear Arlo Pro is a smart choice if you plan to install security cameras outside your home due to the hub's extended Wi-Fi range. You can also use them inside for advanced install flexibility in places where you don't have easy access to an outlet. Still, I prefer the Canary Flex for flexible indoor/outdoor monitoring. The Flex's hardware and app are extremely well designed and you don't have to bother with a hub.\n",
      "Belkin WeMo Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For a few years now, Belkin's WeMo line of smart home switches have been  \ta reasonably affordable home automation starting point. Now, for 2017, Belkin figured it was time to refresh the lineup.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main attraction is the new WeMo Mini Wi-Fi Smart Plug, currently available for presale at a price of $35 (‎the Mini isn't available outside of the US yet, but other WeMo products are -- converted roughly, the price comes out to about £30 or AU$50). Just like the original WeMo Switch, it'll let you automate anything you plug in behind it, but like the name suggests, it's a lot smaller than before. That means it won't block off adjacent outlets like the old switches do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the smaller design, there's really nothing new here. The WeMo Mini offers all of the same features as  \tthe original WeMo Switch, including its integrations with platforms and services like IFTTT, Nest, Google Home and Amazon's Alexa -- but still no support for Apple HomeKit, or for Siri. It won't track energy usage, either; for that, you'll need to spend a few bucks extra on a WeMo Insight Switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of Siri controls aside, the WeMo Mini is still a well-connected smart plug, and a sensible follow-up purchase for anyone who got an Amazon Echo or a Google Home smart speaker for Christmas, as both will let you turn the plug on and off using voice commands. It isn't perfect, but at $35, the WeMo Mini is a safe, simple way to dip your toes into the connected home of tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart plugs like the WeMo Mini are some of the simplest and most straightforward connected home gadgets you can buy. Plug one in and then plug something else into it, and you'll be able to turn that thing on and off from your phone, or automate it to turn on and off at specific times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most obvious use cases include lamps, space heaters, desk fans, and other small appliances you might want to automate, but there's room for creativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, you could plug your entertainment center's power strip into a smart plug, then automatically cut the juice to your AV gear during the night when you aren't using any of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's even a smart frying pan that can sync with a WeMo Switch to automatically cook your dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Connecting your smart plugs with other smart home gadgets and services opens the door to even more possibilities. WeMo does pretty well here, boasting compatibility with Nest, IFTTT, Google Home and Amazon Alexa, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shouldn't be lost on anybody that the WeMo Mini looks a lot like two of its top competitors, the  iHome Smart Plug and the iDevices Switch. Both of those Belkin challengers went with small designs that don't block adjacent outlets, making the bulky first-gen WeMo Switch look dated by comparison. Updating the design was a necessary concession for Belkin -- and a clear sign that it's keen on keeping the WeMo Switch competitive on retail shelves.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a good move. After  selling millions of units last year, Amazon's Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers were both predictably hot sellers this holiday season -- and that means huge numbers of new potential customers for Belkin's Alexa-ready WeMo hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throw in the debut of the Google Home smart speaker, with which WeMo was an early partner, and you're looking at what's shaping up to be a big 2017 for voice-compatible smart home gadgets. No wonder Belkin wants its WeMo Switch ready for a fresh closeup.\n",
      "\n",
      "But staying competitive with iHome and iDevices isn't just about cosmetics. Both of those smart plugs work with  Apple HomeKit, the set of smart home controls built into the software that powers iPhones and iPads. Like its predecessors, the WeMo Mini doesn't, and a Belkin spokesperson tells me that it isn't likely to anytime soon, since Belkin decided not to add in the necessary HomeKit chipset.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal, the company tells me, was to avoid a situation where some WeMo products worked with HomeKit while other WeMo products didn't. That means no HomeKit compatibility for any of them for the foreseeable future. With HomeKit still working to establish itself as a market mover, that'll either turn out to be a sage bit of restraint or a big missed opportunity for Belkin. My guess is that we'll know which by the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Belkin does have one clear advantage, though, and that's the $35 price tag. It's a cheaper cost of entry than iHome or iDevices, and closer to what you'll pay for bargain-priced competitors from names like Koogeek and TP-Link, where Belkin's name recognition should serve it well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WeMo Mini uses the same Android and iOS app as existing WeMo devices. I'm holding out hope that Belkin will overhaul that app sometime this year. It's a good-looking piece of software that's pretty easy to navigate, but  it suffers from laggy performance -- a quibble that continued as I started testing out the new WeMo Mini.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sync everything up, you'll follow the app's instructions and plug the WeMo Mini in, then wait a few seconds for it to start broadcasting its Wi-Fi signal. After connecting to that signal, you'll return to the app, where it'll tether the plug to your home network.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my tests, this pairing process was typically pretty sluggish, often timing out and requiring me to force-quit the app. After launching it back up, the WeMo Mini would always be online and ready to go...but still, not a great first impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things got better from there, though. To Belkin's credit, the app seemed noticeably faster than  the last time I tested it out for a post from the CNET Smart Home. Unlike in that round of tests, I didn't encounter the problem where my switches were listed as unresponsive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WeMo app offers a simple and intuitive rules engine that lets you get your feet wet with home automation. You could, for instance, create a rule that turns a lamp on at sunset, or when a WeMo motion detector catches you walking into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my home, I have a rule that turns off a space heater every night at 1:00 a.m.. If I ever forget to turn it off, WeMo will remember for me and keep it from running all night. Most importantly, the app makes it really easy to create those kinds of automations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Syncing up with the Amazon Echo smart speaker was a cinch, too. Once the plug is up and running on your home network, just ask Alexa to discover new devices. Within seconds, she'll detect the WeMo Mini and add it to her list of supported gadgets, and you'll be able to tell her to turn it on and off using whatever name you picked for it in the WeMo app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Commands like these worked perfectly in my tests, and in my own home, where I've regularly used an Amazon Echo to turn a lamp plugged into a WeMo Switch on and off for over a year now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlling the switch using the Google Home smart speaker, with which Belkin's WeMo gear will soon enjoy native compatibility, should be just as easy once that integration is up and running. For deeper automated controls, it's fairly simple to connect your WeMo gear with the free online service IFTTT, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "And remember, if you're turning your switches on and off with voice commands and automations like these, then you'll rarely need to open the app at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the rise of internet-connected devices in our homes comes some legitimate security concerns, but Belkin's on pretty solid footing here. The company has done an admirable job of responding to potential vulnerabilities with regular firmware updates, and uses standard transport layer encryption for all transmissions to and from WeMo devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke with a Belkin representative about  how WeMo handles security last year -- this is what the company said:\n",
      "\n",
      "As with a lot of smart home gadgets, a lot of it comes down to how well-secured your home network is. Setting strong passwords and then updating them regularly is a good start, and if you need additional guidance,  we've got you covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "At just $35 each, the WeMo Mini is one of the most affordable smart plugs on the market, and it's a perfect fit with voice controllers like the Amazon Echo or Google Home smart speakers. Integrations with IFTTT and with the Nest Learning Thermostat let you go even deeper into home automation if you choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you were holding out for Apple HomeKit support and the Siri controls that come with it, then you're disappointed (and in that case, jumping in with iDevices or iHome is your best bet). For everyone else, I think the WeMo Mini deserves strong consideration. Like the original, it's a smart, simple way to get started with home automation, and the new, less obtrusive design is leaps and bounds better than before.\n",
      "Nutrismart\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Devices that scan bar codes on your food packages were popular at this year's CES in Las Vegas (just take a look at what happens when you scan an empty bottle of syrup on the GeniCan). But all of these products focus on packaged products rather than fresh food. French manufacturer Terraillon has taken a different approach: The company created a kitchen scale that can do a visual scan of your food and tell you its nutritional information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nutrismart isn't available yet, but a Terraillon rep said the company  wants to begin selling the product in Europe later this year and in the US in 2018. The price will be about $200 (roughly  £160/AU$275).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nutrismart will weigh your produce or meat like a normal kitchen scale, and a small, built-in camera will scan the food. It will send that info to an app that will show you the nutritional information such as calories and water content.\n",
      "\n",
      "The product sounds like it could be useful for folks who have to be very careful about what they eat and want exact calorie counts. But Terraillon will have to prove that a $200 scale is worthwhile when apps like MyFitnessPal will give you that info for free.\n",
      "Curb Whole-Home Energy Monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We've seen plenty of systems capable of tracking your home's energy usage, and even spent some time  testing one of them out in the CNET Smart Home. It's a patently good idea, but to date, we haven't seen a product that really nails the execution yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I was so intrigued by what I heard from Curb, an Austin-based startup that's working to bring whole-home energy tracking to the masses. Curb founder and CEO Erik Norwood walked me through the system's ins and outs in a booth off the beaten path here at CES, and the more I listened, the more encouraged I became.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core device is a $400 gadget that sits inside of your breaker box, with special sensors that clamp onto each circuit to track how much power they're putting out. Curb feeds that data to the cloud, letting you monitor everything in real time on your computer, or on your phone using Curb's app.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not dramatically different than other players in the space, including  Neurio, the system we reviewed back in 2015. And, like those competitors, you'll need to hire an electrician to install everything. From hands-on accounts on the web, that could take as long as 3 hours, and if you figure roughly $100 per hour for a good electrician's time, that adds up fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curb's creators recognize that those installation woes are a major friction point for adoption. To that end, they came to Vegas with a potentially significant new partner:  Schneider Electric. You might never have heard of it (I hadn't before this week), but it's the name behind the largest manufacturer of residential breaker boxes. That could help Curb get its gadget installed in people's homes before they even move in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another strong point: Curb's software. Both the app and the web portal visualize your home's energy usage especially well, with a spinning radar-like display that shows your power consumption on a second-by-second basis. You can also view your usage over time, with stacked graphs that offer a clean breakdown of your consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "That data also makes Curb something of a connected home-enabler. After all, once you can track everything's power usage, you'll have an extra incentive to smarten all of it up so that you can automate it, or turn it off remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't want to make switches and thermostats to compete with Samsung and Nest,\" Norwood said. \"We'd rather be the conductor of the symphony.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To that end, Curb boasts an integration with  Samsung's SmartThings connected home platform. Enable it, and you'll be able to turn your SmartThings-enabled lights and appliances on and off directly from Curb's web portal or app -- an easy way to take action as you comb through Curb's energy-tracking data.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like that, in addition to tracking energy consumption, Curb can track the energy production of any solar panels you might have installed. That's a good, forward-thinking feature for energy-conscious consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curb is available now in the US, and I think it's worth keeping on your radar. I'm itching to test it out in  the CNET Smart Home -- when that time comes, we'll let you know all of the ins and outs.\n",

      "Nobody likes doing laundry. And even after you've washed and dried everything, you still have to fold it all and put it away. Bummer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, startup Seven Dreamers wants to help out with this  everyday chore in the form of Laundroid, an imposing  laundry-folding-robot that looks kind of like a bottom freezer fridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "Toss  up to 30-40 pieces of clothing into the drawer in the bottom. Laundroid  is then supposed to be able sort through what's inside and get to  folding. Its built-in AI and image analysis distinguishes among  t-shirts, pants and even underwear. It isn't able to fold socks, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "From there, the robotic arm inside the appliance will pick up a single item at a time and spend the next 5 minutes or so folding it. No, it isn't very fast, but I suppose it's better than doing it yourself. Seven Dreamers also has a related Android and iPhone app for remote access to the bot.\n",
      "\n",
      "We saw Laundroid previously as a prototype (it's been in development since 2005), but Seven Dreamers plans to open preorders worldwide in March. Pricing hasn't yet been announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to this Laundroid unit, the company also plans to introduce a custom version for hospitals and nursing homes in 2018, as well as an all-in-one washer, dryer and laundry folder in 2019. In the meantime, we hope to track down a review unit of Laundroid to try out for ourselves at the CNET Smart Home.\n",

      "\n",
      "Admit it: You've put some ramen in a pot on the stove, stepped out of the kitchen and forgot all about your instant meal. Hopefully, you caught your mistake before a fire broke out. But a startup called Inirv Labs wants to make sure you avoid household disasters with knobs that will automatically shut off your burners if you forget you're cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week at CES in Las Vegas, Inirv hooked up its system -- called the Inirv React -- to a cooktop and demonstrated how it will keep your kitchen (and ramen) safe. The company also launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for the product this week, and it surpassed its $40,000 goal within three days. The system will cost $299 when it's released, and it will come with four knobs and a sensor. That price converts roughly to £245 in the UK and AU$410 in Australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how $299 Inirv React system works:\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll be able to change the settings and disable the turn-off feature in the app in case you need your burner on for long periods of time, like if you're making a stew over low heat for a couple of hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "You mount a sensor to your kitchen ceiling. The sensor is Wi-Fi- as well as Bluetooth-connected, and it can detect smoke, gas and motion.Pop off your old burner knobs and replace them with Inirv knobs, which are also Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-enabled.The sensor will prompt the knobs to automatically shut off your burner if it detects a hazard like smoke or fire, and it doesn't detect any motion from you.The Inirv's iOS and Android app will also send you a notification to let you know that it's about to shut your burner off.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alexa everywhere.\" That's been one of the top themes of CES 2017, with device makers large and small introducing new skills for Amazon's smash-hit voice-activated assistant. And, with Amazon having made it relatively easy for device-makers to code the virtual helper directly into their products, we're also seeing lots of new gadgets that come with Alexa built right in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter Dok Talk, which makes a wide assortment of multi-device charging stations. Their newest, the Dok Talk CR25, features a little microphone button on top -- give it a tap, and voila, there's Alexa, ready to take your question or command.\n",
      "\n",
      "The device itself has five USB inputs capable of charging both phones and tablets (complete with protection against over-charging), as well as a Bluetooth speaker in the base and a Qi wireless charging pad that'll let you charge a sixth device. It looks capable enough as a basic bedside charging station (if not a bit generic), but the addition of Alexa makes it into something a lot more compelling, especially given Alexa's ever-growing library of third-party skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's good evidence that Alexa is proving to be a rising tide for in-home tech. Even off-brand, otherwise unremarkable devices like this one can bring in Alexa where it makes sense; in doing so, they get to expand the functionality of what they're selling to a near-exponential degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it also gives companies that make bargain-bin junk an excuse to jack up the price of what they're hocking. I'm not saying that's what Dok Talk's up to here (and I can't speak to the quality of the device until we test one out), but I'll still be curious to see how the CR25's yet-to-be-determined asking price compares to the company's non-Alexa-enabled chargers when it arrives later this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, Dok Talk says the plan is to sell it for less than the Amazon Echo's current asking-price of $180 in the US and £149 in the UK (The Echo isn't currently available in Australia, but its price converts roughly to AU$245). Hopefully, it's a  lot less given that those standard Dok Talk chargers run for about $80 in the US, and unlike the Echo the Dok Talk makes you press a button to wake Alexa up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CR25 is heading to market later this year, both on Dok Talk's website and on Amazon.  Dok Talk also plans to sell a less expensive version of the charger that keeps Alexa, but ditches the Qi charging pad. Both will ship worldwide.\n",

      "\n",
      "Opening the blinds has never been so helpful. On display here at CES in Las Vegas, SolarGaps turns the actual slats of your window coverings into solar panels. SolarGaps blinds will be smart enough to shift their angle slightly throughout the day in order to maximize their power intake. The company also plans to integrate with the Google Home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd love to control solar-powered blinds with my voice using Google's always-listening assistant, but note that Google's smart home language -- Weave -- doesn't actually work with blinds yet. SolarGaps could be extra exciting if it's an indication of a whole new smart home product category for Google Home. Or SolarGaps could be a small tech startup trying to make noise at CES by name-dropping Google. I'm hoping for the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google Home aside, SolarGaps will have iOS and Android apps. The company also wants to integrate with Nest and SmartThings. If your Nest senses it's too cold, it could send a signal to your blinds to let in more light and heat your place naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "SolarGaps has a control box that responds to gestures, and the app has the functionality you'd expect -- basic controls and scheduling. SolarGaps blinds should cost between $480 to $890 per square meter of window, and they don't look the part of high-priced designer blinds. They look like big, black solar panels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, if you prioritize energy and convenience over style, SolarGaps blinds will be worth keeping an eye on, especially if the company can pull off that Google Home integration. SolarGaps will start a crowdfunding campaign in February for a planned release in the middle of the year. (UK and Australian details weren't available, but those prices convert to roughly £390 and £725 or AU$660 and AU£1,220.)\n",

      "\n",
      "The second-generation Bixi, due out by the end of the year, keeps the same idea intact. Lift your hand over it to raise the volume of your speakers, or wave your hand across it to flip the page on your iPad. Bixi 2 will also accommodate those of us that love to use our voice with an Alexa integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Bixis respond to seven different gestures. They talk to your phone or tablet via Bluetooth, and Bixi 2 will connect directly to Wi-Fi. You can program Bixi to control any Bluetooth device, and via Wi-Fi hopefully Bixi will be able to talk to a lot more smart home devices -- though a Bixi rep wouldn't offer specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw both Bixis on display at CES 2017. The first was released in France last year and will be coming to the US in March. The motion-sensing tech looks cool, especially if you're in the kitchen and handling food. The small, portable Bixi is easy to take with you and its rechargeable battery lasts a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll need to be within 6 to 8 inches to get a response from Bixi. That limitation was intentional to help prevent accidental usage from your ordinary gestures. Still, the short range makes me wonder how useful it would be rather than just pulling out your phone. Alexa will help, though Amazon's assistant won't be always listening via Bixi as she is in the Amazon Echo. You'll have to wake Bixi up with a wave, then you'll be able to command Alexa normally.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you'd like options for controlling your smart home, the motion-sensing, Alexa-enabled Bixi 2 will be out by the end of the year. A Bixi rep wouldn't confirm a price, though the first Bixi will cost $100 when it comes out in the US in March. If Bixi 2 is much more than that, I'll have a tough time seeing its value over the original $180 Amazon Echo.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anybody who shares a bed -- or even just a room -- with someone who snores knows how frustrating trying to get a good night's sleep can be. The best way to quiet the person down is usually just to poke them, which can make the whole night a series of sleeping periods, punctuated by snoring, waking and poking. Now there's a machine that will break up that rhythm by doing the poking for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart Nora consists essentially of two parts: an electronic sensor that rests on a bedside table and listens for repeating sounds in a particular frequency range (i.e. snoring); and an inflation device that slides underneath the snorer's pillow and blows up when they snore, repositioning their head. Altogether, the gadget will set you back about $300 (however, at the time of writing, it was on sale for $260).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's difficult to measure how successful Smart Nora actually is -- especially since the snorers themselves shouldn't notice much of a difference. But the logic behind the device seems sound. The electronics are kept away from the head. The device is designed to filter out bedroom noises -- although false positives shouldn't be an issue if the device truly is nonintrusive, as the developers claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nora also offers some additional smarts: you don't have to use it with an app, but if you choose to do so, you can record audio and track your snoring to make sure the device really is making a difference. The app will also tell users if their snoring might indicate sleep apnea, and whether they should consult a doctor. Obviously, Smart Nora isn't a medical device, but getting a tip if you or a loved one has apnea is a great perk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, Smart Nora also has some apparent issues before even testing it. First off, many people are restless sleepers, or roll around during the night. If such a person were to roll off the pillow, then Nora couldn't do anything to affect their snoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the $300 price tag isn't too appealing. Sure, the tech behind the device is interesting. It might even help mitigate snoring. But it's hard to swallow a $300 surcharge before testing it for yourself -- especially when you can find plenty of low-tech snoring solutions for under a hundred bucks.\n",

      "The Google Assistant's expanding its repertoire as an entertainer. At CES, Nvidia showed off the new Shield TV. Say the word and you can search for content, pause or rewind with your voice, all powered by Google's software. The Shield TV will even display information if you search the internet, and it works with SmartThings to control your home. If you buy the $200 streamer, you won't even have to be in the same room to talk to Google, thanks to a $50 add-on called the Nvidia Spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shield TV is out later this month. The Spot's release date hasn't been specified. An always listening controller with the Google Assistant built-in, the Nvidia Spot sure sounds a lot like a Google Home. The Spot looks different -- a round orb as opposed to a white cylinder. You'll also be able to easily move the Spot from room to room and even attach it to walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, a lot of the functionality sounds the same as Google's own product -- you'll be able to command your TV, search the web and control your smart home via voice command. Nvidia specified SmartThings integration for Spot and Shield, but Google Assistant works with more platforms than that on Google Home -- so I wonder if Spot has a more limited version of the Assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia's platform will offer more streaming options than Google's products can do on their own. With a Google Home and a Chromecast streamer plugged into your TV, you can control Netflix and YouTube with your voice. Shield's promised those platforms, plus Amazon Video, Google Play movies and Vudu.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've been looking for Google Home to expand its functionality at CES. The Shield TV is a nice step -- if somewhat redundant. The Spot itself looks to serve the same purpose as Home, and the integration expands upon something the Google Assistant already did.

The CloudTot is one of those devices, but it also includes some features that just make parenting an infant easier. And for $250 (converts to AU$340, £200), the co-sleeper isn't as steep as many non-connected competitors on the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CloutTot has three important smart features. First, it includes a speaker for emitting white noise, playing music and listening for the baby's cries. You can control the speaker from the CloudTot app, which also will send you notifications if your child wakes up and cries during a nap in the other room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The device also includes a pad that detects moisture, so if the child wets the bed, you'll get an alert on the app. The materials are easily disentangled from the electronics, so you can put them all through the washer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the CloudTot includes two \"Pep pegs,\" which prod the child if they sense no motion for twelve seconds. The logic behind the pegs is that autonomic functions (like breathing) are underdeveloped in young infants, so in deep sleep, they can essentially forget to breath. The Pep peg will gently prod the child to rouse them and encourage breathing again. The device will also notify a parent via the app.\n",

      "\n",
      "You'll also receive a push notification when your filter nears the end of its life. The tip of the Airpulse -- the side inside the filter -- also has acoustic sensors. The HVAC pros that started Breezi programmed Airpulse to listen for specific frequencies in the way the air is blowing. Based on the type of HVAC system you have, supposedly, AirPulse can use the sound of the air blowing past it to diagnose potential problems before you'd normally notice them.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Moxi stroller uses the kinetic energy of its wheels, generated by walking with your child, to charge your phone, light your path with headlights and track your distance on an LCD screen. Pretty cool, right? The bad news is, it costs a steep $700 (converts to roughly AU$950, £570).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moxi offers a few extra design features to sweeten the deal, though. Most notably, the seat can reorient in three different ways. It can face forward or backward, and it can lie flat for young infants. This feature alone will cost a pretty penny with many high-end strollers -- so the price tag isn't quite as bad as it initially might seem.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only two critiques of the stroller itself as I've seen thus far are its relatively simple app and its weak headlights. The app and LCD screen currently display distance traveled, but I'd like to see more creative information and analysis of walks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The headlights look nice, but they certainly aren't strong enough to light a dark path. Most parents won't be out after dark with their children anyway, but it'd be nice to see the features have real use to them, other than as extra lines on a feature-list.\n",

      "How much do you love your kid? Would you drop $1,160 to give them a better night of sleep? Head to CES 2017, where influential tech designer Yves Béhar and legendary doctor Harvey Karp (inventor of the Five S's for soothing infants) have teamed up to create a baby bed called the Happiest Baby Snoo. But it won't come cheap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Snoo bed is no standard sleeper, it's heavy duty. It takes two people to carry comfortably, and it looks great. All that is due to Behar's design, which eschews the gaudy colors and cheap plastic that adorn most baby-tech these days, and instead uses high quality woods, fabrics and metals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The features, too, set Snoo apart from the competition. It will rock children and use white noise to soothe them, but how it does so is carefully calibrated to respond to the particular needs of the child. So the baby is sleeping, Snoo will emit a low frequency noise and rock more slowly. If the child begins to wake up and cry, the bed will rock more rapidly and raise the frequency of its noise emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bed also includes swaddling sacks that keep children on their backs during their first six months of life, and are made of mesh to keep them from overheating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concepts behind Snoo aren't new, but their execution could very well be more successful, given the minds and research behind the device. That said, the $1,160 price tag will simply seem like an absurd prospect for most parents -- especially since the device will work for only six or seven months for many children.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm looking forward to testing out the Happiest Baby Snoo soon, but I'm looking forward even more to the price dropping so parents can do more than look on wistfully at one more device they won't buy for their kid.\n",

      "Hugo has motion detection, an SD card and can spin 360 degrees, so it has the features to function well as a smart home security cam as well as a baby monitor. Since it reads faces so well, it makes sense that it also can tell people from animals, so you won't get an alert if you're away and your pet crosses into view.\n",

      "During the demo, I was impressed by the novelty. I could see my face on a screen and Hugo would pick up my smiles and frowns and read my emotions accordingly, though I'm not sure of it's ability to track subtlety. Then again, crying babies aren't exactly subtle. However, I'm worried Hugo would lose track if the baby rolls over -- as it seemed to struggle with faces at an angle.\n",

Each promises to be unique in some way, but all offer the same basic tricks that the Amazon Echo has offered for a couple of years -- control your smart home, play music and provide personal assistance. A product called the Little Fish looks at first glance to be yet another knockoff, but given that it's from the Chinese internet giant Baidu -- known as \"the Google of China\" -- the Little Fish might just have the clout to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, the Baidu Little Fish has a large screen to display additional information after you ask a question. It also has a camera, with which it can supposedly recognize your face and customize its answers accordingly. You'll be able to hold video chats on a Little Fish, and stream videos directly to the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, expect the usual Echo functionality. Baidu will try to get a leg up on these fronts with advanced AI for a more conversational assistant. That's how Google tried to beat the Echo, with the conversational Google Assistant, but Alexa keeps making strides on this front as well. We're still waiting for a digital assistant to perfect natural give-and-take-in voice commands. Perhaps Baidu can be the one to pull this off.\n",

The kit includes everything you need to collect your biometrics for them to analyze: lancets for blood samples, mouth swabs for DNA samples and a tape measure for your body dimensions. You send everything back to Habit, and they'll analyze your information to create a food profile that recommends food you should eat to lose weight.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sure, we quite like models from iRobot and Neato, but expect to shell out $700 plus for a current gen model and upward of $500 even for an older Neato. Starting in March, you'll be able to buy any one of four new Black & Decker bots priced between $300 and $400.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the top of the range, the $400 Smartech bot has features competitive with iRobot and Neato. Like the recent Neato Botvac Connected and Roomba 980, you can steer the Smartech bot with an app on your phone and set a schedule for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Better yet, the $400 Smartech bot senses whether it's vacuuming carpet or hardwood and switches modes automatically. We saw Smartech debuted on stick vacuums at CES last year. The rest of its specs are competitive as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "The magical device comes by way of Griffin Technology, a self-described manufacturer of \"useful and fun solutions.\" And, if your problem is poorly toasted bread, then boy, do they have a solution for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's called the Connected Toaster, and it boasts a Bluetooth radio and a smartphone app. It costs $100 (which converts to roughly AU$140 or £60). It is not a joke. Its sole mission is to toast your favorite breads and bagels to crusty, app-enabled perfection. Sync everything up, and you'll be able to dial in to the precise toast settings you're craving with just a few taps. And, should the need to toast bread ever arise once more, never fear -- the app will remember your preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, an untouched rotary dial is pretty good at remembering your preferred setting, too. Just sayin'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, in fairness, $100 actually isn't that terribly outrageous for a nice-looking, high-end toaster. In fact, we've tested and reviewed designer toasters that cost as much as $500. No apps for any of those, though.\n",

      "Their product is called, simply enough, the Connected Mirror, and it's a shiny, reflective surface that connects with your home Wi-Fi network in order to display the local time and weather and any missed notifications from your phone, as well as updates from any other Griffin gear under your roof (their catalog includes app-enabled phone chargers, a connected coffeemaker, and even a Bluetooth toaster).\n",
      "\n",
      "Those updates will appear whenever you touch the mirror's capacitive surface, then disappear when you're done with them. You can also use Griffin's app to connect with the mirror in order to choose the information you want it to display.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of that will come cheap, though. When it arrives at the end of 2017, Griffin's Connected Mirror will cost you a cool $1,000 (about £810 or AU$1,390, converted roughly). At that price -- and without any notable third-party integrations to get people who've already bought into the smart home excited about it -- it's hard to see this as more than a luxury niche product.\n",

      "\n",
      "If the Rokid Pebble works as promised, maybe the name Melody will become just as recognizable as  \tAlexa or Siri. If not, this aptly named spherical assistant could be just another Amazon Echo wannabe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Launching this summer in the US, the Pebble listens for you to say the wake word \"Melody,\" then responds to your commands. Much like the Echo and Alexa, you don't have to touch the Pebble, just talk to it, and it'll add items to your calendar, play music, and control your smart home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pebble looks capable as an entertainer -- you'll be able to stream music from  \tSpotify and iHeartRadio -- and as a smart home controller -- it'll work with Nest, Philips Hue, Wink and IFTTT at launch with a SmartThings integration in the works. The Pebble will chart its own course by being able to recognize your voice and customize its responses accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it can recognize voices, the Pebble should be able to beat the Echo as a personal assistant. You can train Melody to do different things when you greet it as opposed to when your significant other does. So simply by saying \"Melody, hello,\" it'll set the thermostat, turn on the lights, and follow any other preset commands you've specified. If your significant other says the same thing, Melody can greet him or her by name and do an entirely different set of commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rokid's Melody also looks to be quite good at keeping your calendar organized. While Alexa, Siri and the Google Assistant are rudimentary at best at helping you manage your schedule, Melody will be able to sync all of your individual calendars, and all of the calendars for your entire family. Then, Melody can check them all and let you know when you're all free.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pebble is the second assistant from tech startup Rokid. The first -- the Rokid Alien -- has been available in China since April. The Alien functions much like the Pebble, only it also has a screen and a camera. The camera can recognize your face and the screen can display additional context and info if you ask it a question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the Pebble and the Alien will be available for purchase in the US starting this summer, though Rokid doesn't yet have pricing information for either. Both also have a small battery that'll keep them powered for around two hours, making them more mobile than the Amazon Echo -- which always has to stay plugged in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the Amazon Echo, the  Google Home and Siri's HomeKit on your iPhone, you already have lots of options for a digital assistant. At CES, we've seen many more contenders that want to vie for that position, so the Rokid Pebble will need to be affordable and polished if it hopes to have a chance of standing out among tough competition. The promise of individualized assistance for multiple users is enticing, though, and if it can help you and your family organize your lives, Melody might well earn her way toward the front of the bunch.\n",

      "Incipio already makes  a smart plug and a smart light bulb adapter that both work with Apple HomeKit for Siri-ready voice controls. Now, the gadget maker is announcing two new \"CommandKit\" products that will join them, including a $60 Wi-Fi light switch that'll let Siri dim the lights, no hub needed. And, in case you're a little more fond of Alexa, the switch will work with Amazon's virtual assistant, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new switch really couldn't have picked a better time to debut. Though it hasn't proven itself to be a major market mover yet, Apple HomeKit is nonetheless starting to get pretty compelling thanks to  strong security standards and growing diversity of compatible gadgets (and Siri tricks to go with them). On the Amazon side, sales of the Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers are through the roof -- meaning more people than ever are on the lookout for nifty new Alexa-ready gadgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a fan of the price, too. At $60, Incipio's Wi-Fi switch will cost a lot less than other dimmable smart light switches that work with Siri or Alexa (let alone both). The price converts to a little less than £50 or about AU$85.\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential trade-off? Incipio's switch doesn't sound like it'll be quite as feature-rich as those alternatives, and the design isn't quite as sharp as what we've seen from names like  Lutron or iDevices, or from the upcoming Belkin WeMo Dimmer Switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a motion sensor in the center of the switch that can trigger lighting changes, though. That's a really nice addition, since you'll never need to worry about changing its battery. It also looks like both of the dimming buttons, including the one that raises the brightness, are positioned on the bottom half of the switch, which might take a little getting used to.\n",

      "\n",
      "With four automatable outlets that you can can control independent of one another, this thing is basically a four-way  WeMo Switch that'll let you automate four things at once. Aside from syncing it up with Apple HomeKit or with one of Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices to control it with your voice, you'll also be able to turn the outlets on and off from Incipio's app, or by scheduling them to turn on and off at specific times.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Apple HomeKit compatibility also lets you control the outlets using Apple's Home app on your iPhone or iPad. You can also pin outlets to the Control Center, then swipe up and tap to turn them on and off -- no app needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power strip's other big trick is that it'll track the energy usage of whatever you're plugging into it. That's a nice little bonus, and an added value if you're looking to cut your consumption. Automation can help with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "At $100 (about £80 or AU$140, converted roughly), this is definitely expensive for a power strip, but it costs a lot less than you'd spend on four switches from iDevices or Belkin WeMo. Provided you've got four things right next to each other that you're ready to plug in and automate, it sounds like it might be a smart buy once it hits the market this summer. We'll keep an eye out for it.\n",

      "\n",
      "While that might mean it's final form is more likely to be good, it also means we might not see the little guy come out for quite some time -- perhaps years. LG gave no information regarding an expected release date or pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, the LG Hub Robot seems to rely at least partially on Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for skills like playing music and alerting users to weather conditions. But by the time the machine makes it to market, it's just as likely to be running on its own proprietary voice tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's certain now is that it will connect LG's smart appliances around the house, like the oven, robot vacuum cleaner and washing machines. As it spends more time with users, it should learn their patterns and adjust its use of these appliances accordingly.\n",

      "In addition, the LG Hub Robot features a circular \"face\" with a screen displaying eyes -- perched atop a softly conical white body.

The screen can also display images and videos using some sort of basic web browser.\n",

      "\n",
      "Enter Fisher-Price's newest device: the Fisher-Price Think and Learn Smart Cycle. The Smart Cycle aims to give kids an outlet for that extra energy -- but also instruction for their expanding intellects. At $150 (converts to roughly AU$200, ‎£120), the Cycle will connect via Bluetooth to tablets or TVs, and offer learning apps that focus on math, science, STEM, literacy, and social studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I don't love the idea of adding another reason to stare at screens in the homes of today's children, Fisher-Price's device looks interesting. It certainly could supplement the time beleaguered parents are already logging everyday, offering an alternative to TV programs that fail to teach or get kids moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Smart Cycle also offers cool ways for parents to track their child's progress through the learning courses. A Bluetooth-connected app allows monitoring over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "My concerns about the Smart Cycle as a parent are twofold: Practically, whether children actually decide to spend time on a stationary bicycle depends heavily on whether the course offerings are engaging. Fisher-Price promises more courses in the coming years, but I wouldn't want to shell out $150 without some evidence of the bike's effectiveness with my own child.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second concern is more philosophical. I just don't know how helpful early learning is if it doesn't depend on human interaction. The development of foundational critical thinking skills seems especially unlikely if the child has no way to engage the material beyond the strictures laid out by the device. Before I would buy a device like the Smart Cycle, I'd like to see clear empirical evidence from Fisher-Price in support of both learning from a non-human device and from learning while cycling.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time, Fisher-Price couldn't offer me that data. So while the Smart Cycle seems compelling in concept, I'd wait to drop $150 until I saw real numbers that support its use.\n",

      "As you might expect of a smart home system, Ooma's sensors will notify you if they detect something out of the ordinary. The sensors won't just notify you, though. Ooma's motion detector, water detector, or door and window sensor can each call 911 themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ooma made a name for itself with the Telo -- a box that plugs into your router and provides you with a home phone service. Telo routes calls over the internet, and you'll need the $90 gadget to make use any of Ooma's new trio of smart home devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduced at CES today in Las Vegas, Ooma's three sensors -- a $35 motion detector, a $30 leak sensor and a $25 door and window sensor -- communicate with the Telo using Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication. DECT is the same tech used by ordinary cordless telephones.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can set the sensors to Home or Away mode and if they detect something amiss, they'll alert you by phone, push notifications, email or text messages depending on your preferences. The sensors can also call 911 directly from your Telo. It'll connect with the dispatcher closest to your home, and can send through the address as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll likely need to pay a monthly fee for this service. If you're already using Ooma's premium service for your Telo, you can add as many sensors to your system as you want without adding to your $10 a month fee. If you're using Ooma's free basic service, you can use one sensor for free, but two or more costs $6 a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no option to use multiple sensors for free and skip the 911 monitoring. That's a shame, but it's also the only thing that makes Ooma's smart home sensors at all unique. The sensors themselves are reasonably priced, so if you already have a Telo, it might make sense to make your home phone smarter.\n",

With that one design choice, this little startup is already a compelling competitor for industry leaders like Belkin WeMo and iDevices.\n",

Sleek design has never been Switchmate's strong suit, though; efficiency has. As expected, then, Switchmate's device might turn a wall freckle into a wall wart -- but it'll be a damn powerful wall wart. It even features a backlight to use as a nightlight.\n",

      "\n",
      "Switchmate has always distinguished itself with ease of install. You simply affix the device overtop a light switch using its magnetic base, and it's pretty much ready to use. The app allows users to toggle the device, which physically flips the switch on and off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Switchmate Bright features a slimmer design than the original device, so you can fit multiple onto a panel of switches. This makes the Bright a much more compelling device for more comprehensive setups, although I'd still like to see a multi-switch version soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bright also includes a motion detector, so it can automatically switch on or off when it senses a user walking into the room. Again, this broadens the appeal of the Switchmate, which originally could automate using only timers or Bluetooth to respond to the proximity of a phone.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Hydrao will also work with Alexa, Amazon's voice-activated digital assistant. It's a fairly limited integration -- you can only ask Alexa how much water you've used and how much money you've saved on your water and energy bills (if you do shorten those showers, that is).\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the Hydrao's app to adjust the amount of water that will trigger each color. If you leave the default settings and reduce the length of your showers, a family of four can save about $200 a year on utility bills, said Eric Burkel, who leads international strategy and development with Smart and Blue. If that turns out to be true, the Hydrao First will pay for itself in a year -- and then some.\n",

The Netatmo Smart Smoke Alarm hopes to be that detector, has all the features you'd expect: an app with remote notifications, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. You can silence the alarm over Bluetooth, though not over Wi-Fi as a \"safety feature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I found Siri's voice controls disappointing in the OneLink Wi-Fi Smoke and CO Alarm, and the Netatmo won't add any extra options. You can ask Siri to check on the status of the alarm. I'd hope that if the alarm was sounding, you wouldn't have to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lackluster voice controls aside, the OneLink alarm was disappointing in more ways than one, so the Netatmo detector could still be worth it for HomeKit fans if its push notifications are snappier. I'd like to be able to silence the alarm from anywhere, but I understand limiting that functionality to Bluetooth's range. The Alarm comes with a battery that's supposed to last 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netatmo's newest smart safety product will be available to purchase later this year. It's on display at CES, though Netatmo wasn't yet ready to confirm a price. A rep did say it would be \"under $100.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the Smart Smoke Alarm, Netatmo also showed off a new Siren that'll work with the company's Netatmo Welcome Cam. The Welcome recognizes faces, and you can set the alarm to start ringing if it sees a stranger. The Siren's also due out later this year with an unspecified price \"under $100.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Complications during pregnancy happen for a surprising number of women, and a new startup called Bloomlife has a solution: a wearable monitor that helps women tell the difference between normal abdominal aches and pains, natural contractions, and signs of complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In theory, I like Bloomlife. It's a device that won't help most women -- but it could give the minority who encounter complications the confidence to either relax or seek proper attention. There are two problems with the actual product, though. First, its monthly fees for the monitoring are overpriced: The first month is $150, the second is $100, and subsequent months are $50. Second, Bloomlife doesn't have the FDA certification of a medical device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price problem is the biggest one, simply because most women won't really need Bloomlife. Contractions are a natural step toward delivery, and few women experience them without knowing what they are, or don't notice them. So paying upwards of $300, depending when you start monitoring the pregnancy, seems unnecessary -- especially at a stage of life that is far more financially demanding than most others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem of reliability, by contrast, might not affect as many users, but it could dramatically affect a few. Bloomlife does rely on longitudinal data, gathered over time from the user, so the information it offers is valid. And even with that data, it doesn't purport to offer diagnoses. But users will naturally look to a device like Bloomlife for actionable advice, and without proper third-party testing, it simply isn't equipped to provide such advice.\n",

And on Tuesday night, a French company called Uzer demonstrated the Eugene, another Wi-Fi-enabled scanner that reads the bar codes on your garbage and tells you if you can recycle the container.\n",
      "\n",
      "The makers of Eugene said they want the scanner to be available in the US and the UK by the end of 2017 for $99 and £99, respectively.\n",

      "The Eugene is about as big as a fist, and you mount it to the wall above your garbage or recycling bin. After you've devoured a box of your favorite snack, you wave the bar code of your empty food container in front of the Eugene, and it will tell you if you can recycle it or throw it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the GeniCan, you can also use the Eugene's app to build grocery lists based on the items you toss and order more groceries from retailers like Amazon or Walmart. The Eugene app, however, will also use the information on the amount of goods that you've recycled to tell you how much energy you've saved by recycling.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At CES 2017, a SmartBeings rep called WooHoo \"an Amazon Echo combined with a Nest Cam, combined with a touchscreen.\" That's an impressive description, and it doesn't even account for lots of other features. WooHoo has facial recognition and voice recognition. WooHoo's head has motion detection and spins all the way around. WooHoo also works as a smart home hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "WooHoo's goal: conquer the smart home. You'll be able to use it as a security cam, and the touchscreen has Android built in and lets you make video calls. In will connect to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave and more. It'll even have a cellular signal and a battery backup.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for its Echo-like functionality, it'll listen for a wake word, like the Echo, and you'll be able to command WooHoo to control your smart home. Since it can recognize your face and your voice, you can even create personalized commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "SmartBeings reps didn't offer any confirmed smart home partnerships at CES, and the device itself is still very much a prototype. That's understandable -- it's still being crowdfunded on Kickstarter. But I'm still worried. Face recognition is a tough technology to get right, as is voice recognition, and so is voice assistance generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "WooHoo aims to do everything, but that won't be worth much if its not as good as the Echo or the Nest, or anything else at any one task. Commendably, the preorder price is enticingly low -- $50 (converts to AU$70, £40) on Kickstarter or the company's site. But you'll need to pay a monthly fee to take advantage of all of the services. That makes sense, given the cellular connection, but it's still an ongoing cost not shared by the many devices it's combining.\n",
      "\n",
      "SmartBeings has ambitiously set summer as a release goal. I'd like to believe WooHoo will be able to hit on all of its promises -- it would be an amazing device if so -- but the SmartBeings team still has a long, difficult road to get to that all-in-one promised land.\n",

      "\n",
      "C-Way, a new kid-tech startup, offers an out: Memoo, a device that houses Amazon's Alexa, but includes parental controls and extra kid-friendly features. Problem is, Memoo costs $175 (AU$240, £140) -- nearly four times the price of an Echo Dot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how Memoo works. First, parents connect the device to an app on their phone, from which they can send voice messages, set basic alarms and set up daily agendas to be read aloud each morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, kids can access games, music, and info on the internet -- all via voice commands. Using pictograms and colors, Memoo will also indicate how the weather outside is, so kids can dress accordingly, and at night, Memoo can trigger connected humidifiers and thermostats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Memoo also lets users access Amazon's parental controls for Alexa. Parents can approve Spotify playlists for their children, limit Wi-Fi access to certain hours and choose particular family members for the kids to be able to contact via voice message through the app.\n",
      "\n",
      "C-Way's idea isn't a bad one. The problem is, Memoo seems to go a long way to supplant the day-to-day interactions that characterize parent-child relationships. It's those small interactions, like waking up a child in the morning or reminding them to grab their lunch on the way out the door, that define parenthood. And while Memoo might appear to be an expedient solution to everyday issues in parenting, my question is, since when is expedience such a priority in caring for a child?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who knew you felt tired all the time because your room didn't smell good enough? A company called Sensorwake, apparently. Oria, its new $150 bedside device (roughly converted to £122 or AU$207) going on sale in summer 2017, patented scents around users' rooms to help them fall asleep faster, and sleep more deeply. Whether it actually accomplishes that purpose remains to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, Oria is a pretty one-dimensional product. It is connected to Wi-Fi, so integration with other platforms is a possibility for the future, but nothing is concrete yet. But it is special in one way: It holds a receptacle for recyclable scent capsules (each lasting about two months with daily use), and a fan for dispersing their aromatic contents around the immediate vicinity of the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensorwake's two patented scents are designed specifically to help users get to sleep faster, and stay in deep sleep more consistently. The company's in-house specialists and business partners cite their own research indicating Oria gets users 40% better sleep. Without third-party corroboration, however, it's impossible to gauge how beneficial the device will actually be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Sensorwake acknowledges aroma is inextricably linked to memory, making it practically impossible to design a device of this sort with broad appeal. Its detailed descriptions of its scents (\"powdered rose, peach and pear, with notes of talc and musk\") certainly sound appealing, but not necessarily effective for all users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my skepticism, though, Oria will likely work at least on an atmospheric level -- much like scented candles and incense. The only problem is, most candles and incenses don't cost $150.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems like color-changing smart lights are everywhere you look at CES, but a $700 hanging lamp from an Austrian startup I've never heard of before still managed to catch my eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Vienna-based startup is named Luke Roberts, and its smart lamp is called, fittingly enough, the Luke Roberts Smart Lamp (it was originally called \"Fluxo,\" but it hit a trademark issue shortly before launch). It's  an Indiegogo success that lets you cast light of any color in any direction by picking a shade in the companion app, then swiping your finger across your phone's screen like a paint brush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though it isn't cheap, it's a pretty impressive product with plenty of color-changing horsepower. Inside are over 300 light-emitting diodes -- for comparison, a color-changing  Philips Hue LED only has a few dozen. The lamp's co-creators, Lukas Pilat and Robert Kopka (get it?) claim that it will put out 2,000 lumens of full-color light above the fixture, and another 3,000 lumens of white light that gets cast downward.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can pick and choose where that light goes, too. If you only want light in one spot of the room, just swipe in that direction on your phone. If you want red light on one side of the room and blue light on the other side, you can do that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obvious question is whether or not this lamp will work with any larger smart home platforms, especially since it's meant to play such a central role in your home. The lamp uses Bluetooth LE to connect with your phone, which limits its range, but that wouldn't keep it from connecting to a Bluetooth-compatible hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compatibility with Apple HomeKit is another possibility. HomeKit is the set of smart home protocols built into iPhones and iPads, and compatible devices enjoy native, unified controls in Apple's Home app, along with Siri voice controls. HomeKit already has a couple of Bluetooth gadgets to its name (and can even use Apple TV to extend their range outside of the home), and it's already been shown to work especially well with color-changing lights like  Philips Hue and Nanoleaf Aurora. It's this lamp's optimal landing spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I want to see it finish shipping out to its surplus of backers, first. The lamp's creators tell me that they're on track to meet that goal in March. Until then, units are available for preorder at a discounted price that comes out to about $500 (or £410/AU$690, converted roughly).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are smart home hubs and there are smart home robots, but where does the dividing line fall?\n",
      "\n",
      "The key is a combination of personality, movement and interaction, according to Hongbin Zhuang, the London-based founder of social robot Olly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pointing to two Olly robots sitting side by side in Emotech's booth at CES Unveiled, Zhuang explains that where one Olly is whizzing around energetically responding to anyone and everyone who engages with it, its neighbour is more calm and reserved -- it only speaks when spoken to.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the result of the robot's deep-learning capabilities that mean as your Olly gets to know you and your daily routines over time, it will evolve to become more like you and respond to the patterns of your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to what the robot can actually do, it is similar to Amazon's Echo or Google Home ($129.00 at Dell Home). It can respond to your questions by looking up information for you, and can control all of your smart devices and internet-connected products you may have around your home. Where it differs from its rivals is in its ability to be proactive. It could predict whether you might want to listen to music when you get home from work for example, as well as what you might like that music to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original prototype of Emotech's robot featured a single eye, but testing suggested that while some users loved this feature, others did not. Now, Olly is a black donut that rises to greet you when you wake it and swivels to face you when you address it. It responds not just with voice, but with mesmeric light patterns that help it express itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Olly we encountered at CES was still in prototype format, but following further user testing this spring, it should be available to buy later this year.\n",

      "PicoPaks are the prepackaged ingredients that work with the push-button brewer -- the $800 (converts to roughly $1,100, £650) PicoBrew Pico. Previously, you picked your PicoPak from a list of professionally crafted microbrews. If you think you can do better, now you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PicoBrew Freestyle allows you to make full use of its online interface to select all of your beer's ingredients -- the hops, the malt, even the yeast -- then the company will ship you your selection, complete with a customized name.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent some time with the system at CES, and Freestyle is delightfully intuitive to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "You start by picking a base type of beer, you have six options ranging from stout to hoppy IPA. Then, Pico will offer suggestions at each of the next phases, but you can drag and drop various grains and hops to your heart's desire and completely change the character of your beer. Better yet, as you make changes, the stats of the beer listed at the top of the page change too. You'll see the beer's color, bitterness and alcohol level, and all of them alter actively as you tinker, as does the price of the Pak.\n",
      "\n",
      "PicoBrew obviously limits you to the types of malt and hops they have in stock, but they have a decent selection. The site will also stop you if you try to push the recipe past what the Pico can handle, but you still have a wide range of wiggle room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only concern I have with the PicoBrew Freestyle is strangely the Pico itself. We're putting it through its paces for a review, and it hasn't impressed me yet. If the Pico ends up winning me over, the Freestyle will be an awesome feature that's available now and free for PicoBrew's customers.\n",

Both Ecobee and Honeywell have introduced lower-priced, sub-$200 smart thermostats within the last year in the Ecobee3 Lite and the Honeywell Lyric T5 (video below). Carrier's new thermostats actually look a lot like Lyric T5. Nest, on the other hand, still sells a single thermostat model for the same price as always -- $249 (£249, not yet available in Australia).\n",

Before you toss your empty box of Frosted Flakes, you hold the bar code up to the GeniCan, and it will automatically add \"Frosted Flakes\" to a grocery list in your GeniCan iOS or Android app. If the GeniCan can't find a bar code, you can use voice commands to tell the device what you want to add to your list. Order a lot of your household items from Amazon? Once you register for the Amazon Dash Replenishment service, anything that the GeniCan scans that's available through Amazon will ship automatically.

      "Aristotle by Nabi\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a baby monitor. It's a voice-activated smart assistant. It answers your questions, and maybe your kids' questions, too. It orders more diapers when you run out and soothes babies back to sleep automatically. It plays with your kids. It could be the most exciting thing toymaker Mattel has ever produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's called the Aristotle, and it's not just an Amazon Echo ($149.00 at Crutchfield) clone: the device is a fully functioning Amazon Alexa assistant that can answer all the same adult questions and has all the same smart-home capabilities -- but if you say \"Aristotle\" instead of \"Alexa,\" it will summon a different voice assistant designed to interact with your kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice-activated speaker also comes with a wireless camera that streams 256-bit encrypted video to your phone, an array of colorful LEDs and special software, some of which -- as a new parent myself -- sounds too good to be true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the additional things that Mattel claims the Aristotle's software does:\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Mattel says that Microsoft's (not Amazon's) cloud services  are doing a lot of the heavy lifting -- it will use Bing search to answer parenting questions and both Microsoft Cognitive Services and \"Cortana Intelligence\" to do AI-like things. On the smart-home side, Mattel says it's compatible with Wink, Wemo, Smart Things, Philips Hue, ZigBee and IFTTT among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my brief time watching Aristotle work, I was impressed by some of the creative integrations its designers thought up. For instance, if a parent left some chores for a child to finish before TV time, Aristotle will ask the child to finish up before turning on the television. If the kiddo is wearing one of Mattel's location-tracking wristbands, Aristotle will wait for the child to actually go do the chore before it will comply with requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most interesting part about Aristotle isn't just the list of features; it's the cohesiveness of the device. It substitutes for multiple devices in a baby nursery -- like a white-noise emitter, monitor and night-light. It also offers goodies for kids once they move to the next stage of development, like stories, games and educational lessons. These features, along with the solid smart-home control, make it a device that could conceivably \"grow up\" alongside your child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, whether a child growing up alongside a digital assistant is a good or bad thing is a separate question -- and one Aristotle's developers were reticent about. Aristotle isn't supposed to parent, Senior Manager of Marketing and Communication Lisa Lee explained, but rather to offer tools to make parents' jobs easier. That's why Mattel won't be following up with research on the effects on children of interacting with digital assistants from a young age. Voice assistants are entering households anyway, and Lee says they want to offer something that more critically thinks about engaging the children in those homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The device should ship in June 2017 for about $300 (this roughly converts to £245 or AU$415). That's not cheap, but it could be a small price to pay for a device that offers so many different services.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you don't have kids, keep in mind that Lenovo also just introduced a $129 Amazon Echo derivative (£105 or AU$179, converted) that could have a much better speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update, January 4 at 11:09 a.m. PT: Mattel claims the Aristotle can do even more things than we originally heard. We've added the full list above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Automatically recognizes when babies wake up, and soothes them to sleep with a lullaby, white noise, a favorite song or a night-light.Logs wet diapers and feedings via voice commands or a phone app.Automatically orders more diapers or formula from Target, Babies R Us and other participating retailers.Automatically looks for deals and coupons on consumable baby supplies.Actually recognizes and answers young kids' questions after a brief voice recognition training sessionAnswers questions until your child falls asleep.Plays guessing games with kids based on animal noises (say the name of the animal) or shapes held up to the camera (say the name of the shape), then lights up with the correct answer.Reads aloud from a selection of dozens of children's books, accompanying them with sound and light effects that match the stories.Hosts sing-alongs and teaches ABCs and 1-2-3s.Recognizes specially designed kids' toys with embedded NFC chips, or with its camera, and provides sound effects when kids play with them (an upcoming Hot Wheels racetrack was one example).Optionally requires kids to say \"Please\" when they ask Aristotle for things, to help teach manners.Helps kids with homework.Gives foreign-language lessons.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past few years, iDevices has slowly been expanding its roster of smart home devices -- from smart plugs, to a thermostat ($110.99 at Amazon.com), an in-wall switch and an outlet. Now it's adding a device to draw them all together: the iDevices Instant Switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike every other iDevices product, the Instant Switch doesn't use Wi-Fi to communicate with users via their phones. Instead, it uses Bluetooth to pair with any other iDevices power device (such as its plugs and switches) and inject a little more control to them. And at $50, the Instant Switch fits right in with the pricing of the other iDevices products -- which is exactly the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Instant Switch basically works like this: you stick it to a wall (using included Command adhesive strips on the back), pair it with another iDevices gadget and use it to control that gadget. That could mean, for instance, sticking the Instant Switch beside your bed, connecting it to a lamp via the iDevices Switch and just punching it from bed whenever you're ready to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or if you have a more elaborate setup, the Instant Switch could control multiple products at once, turning off in-wall switches, outlets and plugs all in concert.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the usability of iDevices' latest product. As someone who's wasted countless hours on cumbersome smart home device installations, I appreciate the effort to streamline the experience. But the features offered by the Instant Switch seem a bit anemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, its convenience comes at the cost of independence: you can only use the Instant Switch as intended if you already have iDevices products. That immediately limits the audience. Plus, that convenience isn't new: you can control the Instant Switch and other iDevices gadgets with Siri or Alexa, so as long as you have your phone, you can control the lights from anywhere already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the Instant Switch doesn't integrate with other non-power devices -- not even iDevices' own Thermostat. That makes it far less appealing than, say, Lutron's in-wall switches, which can integrate with platforms like IFTTT to perform much more complex tasks, or the Belkin WeMo in-wall switch, which also integrates with more devices and still clocks in at the same $50 price as the Instant Switch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless the Instant Switch drops its projected $50 price to something that better reflects its feature set among the competition, it amounts to little more than an interesting failure. Here's hoping when it becomes available in summer 2017 that it will boast more features or a more appropriate price.\n",

      "In addition to its foot-warming capabilities, the 360 Smart Bed also claims a couple of other advanced features:\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the 360 Smart Bed also comes with the same SleepIQ app for Android or iPhone as the company's It Bed. That means you'll still be able to change the firmness settings of your  mattress yourself, check how well you slept the night before and how well you have been sleeping for the past week and month.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of SleepIQ's software, you can also integrate the 360 Smart Bed with products from Nest, Fitbit and other manufacturers. I got the chance to test out this functionality over six weeks of sleeping on the It Bed. While it was easy to pair partnering products to the bed, the integrations didn't help me improve my sleep.\n",

      "With the ConnectSense Bluetooth Extender, shown off in CES at Las Vegas this week, you'll be able to install smart home devices in the far corners of your home without worrying about being out of range. The Extender will send the signal of devices that communicate through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the cloud, allowing you to control those devices while on the go.\n",
      "\n",
      "BLE allows sensors that don't need a lot of power to function for years without needing a battery swap. The biggest drawback of BLE is you have to be nearby (usually in the same room or an adjacent one) to control a Bluetooth device with your phone. The Extender looks to fix that problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "ConnectSense's device will work with Apple's HomeKit, though unfortunately it won't double as a hub for Apple's smart home software. You'll still need an Apple TV or an iPad if you want to use Siri to control your smart home from the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $40 to $50 sensor (the exact price hasn't been finalized) will be available this Spring, and likely works best in conjunction with an Apple TV or iPad.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, a 1080p cam and sturdy wheels designed to traverse any interior flooring, Kuri has a lot going for it. What I first noticed, though, were the eyes. For better or for worse, every inch of Kuri looks to be designed with the goal of making this robot helper adorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I thought Kuri would be a bit like an Amazon Echo strapped to a set of wheels. In practice, Kuri doesn't have nearly the functionality of the Echo -- it's more of a roving security cam with a bluetooth speaker than an always-listening, multi-purpose assistant. Kuri's advantage is its personality. Its wordless chirps and nods remind me of a Pixar character, and Kuri was clearly designed to please the younger members of your family while it helps you patrol the halls and keep an eye on your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "On display at CES, Kuri -- created by the Bosch-backed startup Mayfield Robotics -- will be able to use its camera to check on your pets when you're away. It can set reminders and use its Wi-Fi connection to tell you about the weather. It'll also work with IFTTT, the online rule-maker with a ton of smart home partners, to control some connected devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supposedly, Kuri can also recognize faces and context and adapt its responses accordingly. Those responses include chirps and nods, since Kuri doesn't talk, though it will play podcast, music and tell stories. It also has LEDs built into its chest that can change colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "After spending some time with Kuri in person, I can confirm that it's instantly likable. The way it smiles with its eyes is cute, though I had some trouble getting it to respond to me when I said \"Hey Kuri.\" Weirdly, it responded just fine when I said \"Hey\" near it in another context, but the voice recognition still needs some polish by the time it ships in December 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kuri team has work to do in the coming year, as Kuri wasn't yet ready to follow me autonomously or ready to do anything else via voice command other than chirp. Kuri does successfully navigate from room to room now, remembering where rooms are once you guide it there using the remote control in the app. It also successfully navigates around objects in its path using a laser sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's everything else we know about Kuri so far:\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time it launches, Kuri will supposedly be able to follow a routine based on who it recognizes. It can send you a custom notification if it spots your dog on the couch, so you can yell at Fido using Kuri's speakers. Kuri can patrol your home using a predetermined route, letting you know if it spots something out of the ordinary, and it can use its motion and sound detection to hunt down an unusual occurrence and send you a recording.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of that sounds cool, but Kuri will cost a hefty $700. Starting today, you can preorder Kuri for a $100 deposit. Kuri will only be available in the US when it launches, but its price converts to around £570 or AU$975. For that much, Kuri will need to be more than a security camera that doubles as a toy. I'd particularly hope for more smart home integration and more options for voice commands.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon's Echo is the current standard for smart home assistants -- with some new competition from Google Home, of course -- thanks to its ease of use and surprisingly good voice-controlled personality, named Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while the Echo (and the Echo Dot and Tap) are Amazon-made products, Alexa herself is slipping the bonds of corporate exclusivity and turning up in a handful of other products. We've already seen the Triby smart radio: Now Lenovo has the Smart Assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not a very catchy name, but one look will tell you this is clearly modeled on the Echo. It's a tall cylindrical device, but with a warmer design than Amazon's severe speaker. The top half is white, with a silver 360-degree microphone-speaker combo on top. The bottom half feels more like the Google Home device, with a gray, green or orange woven overlay for a splash of color. Inside is an Intel Celeron N3060 processor, and one 5-watt tweeter and one 10-watt woofer for audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like an Echo, it uses Alexa, it uses the official Alexa phone app, and works with the same wide range of third-party smart home devices. So, design aside, what exactly is the difference between the Lenovo Smart Assistant and an Echo? Lenovo says it's the one area the Echo is often criticized for coming up short -- sound. There's a standard model Smart Assistant, and for $50 more, there's a special Harman Kardon edition with premium audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll have to wait for a serious ears-on test to find out if it makes a real difference, but matching Alexa with a good quality built-in speaker could be a killer combo.\n",

      "The Lenovo Smart Assistant starts at $129 in the US (£105 or AU$179 converted) for the standard edition, which is less than the standard Echo.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The premise is simple: Kwikset's been making locks for generations now, and making smart locks for years. Now, it's introducing a smart lock that works with Siri.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's called the Kwikset Premis, and it's a touchpad deadbolt that works with Apple HomeKit, the smart-home control service built into to Apple's iOS devices. With HomeKit compatibility, you can control and automate the Premis directly from Apple's Home app or from your iPhone's Control Center, alongside other HomeKit-compatible gadgets, and you can lock and unlock it using Siri voice commands, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a retail price of $229, the Premis isn't any less expensive than other popular smart locks, including  \tones from August that also work with HomeKit and Kwikset's own touch-to-open Kevo smart lock, now in its 2nd generation. But it's a very decent smart lock in its own right, boasting a good-looking build, a well-designed app filled with features, and terrific controls for managing multiple users without additional fees. If you're buying in on the Siri-controlled smart home, the Premis is worth consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the way this lock looks, but it isn't a groundbreaking design. Essentially, Kwikset just took its existing touchpad smart lock and swapped out the Z-Wave radio for a Bluetooth radio and the necessary HomeKit chipset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, like I said, it's a decent design. Like we've seen with other recent smart locks, the interior housing is a little smaller than past generations, making it less of an eyesore. My only real complaint is that the touchpad is just slightly less responsive than I would like, occasionally requiring an extra stab of my thumb to enter a digit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't have any trouble installing a Kwikset Premis at the CNET Smart Home, but like with other smart locks, I needed to make sure the door I wanted to smarten up was properly aligned with the latch. Smart locks turn the deadbolt on their own, without help from you. That means that they'll jam if there isn't a smooth path from the door to your door frame. In other words, if you need to push or pull on your doorknob in order to turn your key, that's something you'll need to fix before buying a smart lock like this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that concern in mind, I picked out a particularly well-aligned door in the smart home's mud room and got to work. The Premis doesn't include any installation instructions in the box -- instead, you'll need to download the app for a step-by-step walkthrough. It's definitely helpful, but I would have liked some physical instructions nonetheless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, installation was straightforward, and only took me about twenty minutes or so. All I needed was a screwdriver and some measuring tape. The only steps in addition to what you'd expect from a standard deadbolt are connecting a small cable and inserting four AA batteries, which come included.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the lock successfully installed, the app did a great job of pairing it with our existing HomeKit setup. Within seconds, I was up and running, both in the Kwikset app and in Apple's Home app. I could lock and unlock the door using both, or by using Siri.\n",

      "\n",
      "As cool as those Siri controls are, the real standout is the Kwikset app. It's smartly designed and filled with features -- most notably, a very strong set of controls for managing multiple users. You can assign each one their own four- to eight-digit code, then choose when those codes will work -- a handy way to let dog sitters or service providers in without giving them 24/7 access.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best part is that none of that costs anything extra. With some smart locks, including the Kwikset Kevo, you'll need to pay a fee to add an additional user to the lock. That's not the case with the Premis -- you can add as many users as needed for free, then monitor all of the comings and goings from the app's activity log.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciated the lock's other features, too. One of the most clever: a touchpad randomizer that displays two random digits whenever you wake the touchscreen to enter your code. You'll need to press those two digits before proceeding. That might sound like an annoying extra step, but it's actually a smart way to prevent would-be thieves from scanning your smudgy fingerprints to figure out which digits will open the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to be aware of, though -- as with other HomeKit-compatible products, you won't be able to access the lock from outside of its Bluetooth range unless you've got a third-gen-or-better Apple TV in your home to act as relay. That's the same shortcoming we saw with the HomeKit-compatible Schlage Sense Bluetooth Deadbolt, to which this lock is very similar. At this point, though, an Apple TV is practically a must-have if you're seriously interested in HomeKit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kwikset Premis uses the newest version of its \"SmartKey\" deadbolt, the same as you'll find in other Kwikset locks, including the Kevo. With SmartKey, you can use a little tool to \"re-key\" the lock and make it work with your existing house key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps more importantly, the current-gen SmartKey deadbolt is about as secure as they come. It uses a sliding bar instead of the traditional pin and tumblers, which means that you can't \"bump\" it open with a key blank. It's also highly rated against lock-picking, and, unlike earlier versions, it does a good job resisting brute-force attacks like the one we were able to successfully use on the first-gen Kevo a few years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also appreciated the app's \"Code Disabled\" mode, which lets you temporarily deactivate all codes and restrict the lock to keyed entry only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cybersecurity is another reasonable concern, but Kwikset's on good ground here, too. Apple HomeKit is one of the most security-centric smart home platforms we've tested, demanding robust end-to-end encryption on all of the lock's broadcasts. I'd have plenty of confidence in the Premis if I had one installed in my own home.\n",
      "\n",
      "At $229, the Kwikset Premis does nothing to break the smart lock mold. It looks and behaves just like the smart locks that came before it, and it's just as expensive as they are, too. Even the addition of HomeKit controls is nothing new -- August and Schlage got there first.\n",
      "\n",
      "But sometimes, in absence of a true step forward, a lateral move can do the trick. In this case, Kwikset did an admirable job of refining its app and offering deep controls over who can use your lock, and how they can use it. It also smartly leaned on Apple HomeKit at a point where the platform's strengths are really starting to shine. This isn't a groundbreaking product, but it's a good one, and it might very well be the right smart lock at the right time.\n",
      "Ring Stick Up Cam\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Complete with 720p live video streaming, motion-sensing capabilities and an optional cloud storage service, Ring's $199 (£159) Stick Up Cam is strikingly similar to the smart home startup's Ring Video Doorbell, which comes at the same price. The only things that's missing is, you know, the whole doorbell part.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main benefit to the Wi-Fi-enabled Stick Up Cam lies in its portable weatherproofed design. You can install this camera pretty much anywhere outside,  and power it with a rechargeable battery, a power adapter or an add-on $49 (£40) solar panel accessory.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's a downside. Stick Up Cams were designed to complement Ring Video Doorbells. The idea is that you'll have Ring's buzzer watching over your front door and some Stick Up Cams covering any additional ground. And perhaps to ensure that you'll need or want both products, Ring skimped on some key DIY camera features that would allow it to act as a solid standalone security purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Stick Up Cam is fine, but the Nest Cam Outdoor and Netgear Arlo are stronger DIY security cameras.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring Stick Up Cam is a discreet outdoor-rated security camera with a black finish. It comes with a couple of different base attachments and related hardware. A screwdriver and a drill bit are included with your purchase, too, to help you with the install.\n",
      "\n",
      "For simplicity and to avoid making permanent holes in the CNET Smart Home, I placed a Stick Up Cam on a flat surface during testing instead of attaching it to a wall or ceiling. You'll want to go with something more long-term if you buy one, since wind and other weather changes can easily knock an outdoor camera out of position. They're easier for someone to steal that way, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't say the Stick Up Cam has an especially attractive design, but it did easily blend in with the surroundings. Its hardware felt durable as well, and it survived wind and snow flurries without complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take a look at the chart below to see how Ring's Stick Up Cam compares to other outdoor cameras:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Stick Up Cam's specs may look roughly comparable to other outdoor security cameras, it falls short in a couple of key ways. First, you have to pay for cloud storage. While select DIY security companies do charge a monthly or yearly fee for cloud storage, more and more brands are offering some sort of free option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Netgear's Arlo and Arlo Pro cameras, Canary's Flex and Nest Cam Outdoor all offer free cloud video clips or photos of activity, with the option of upgrading to a paid subscription as needed. Ring charges customers $3 per month or $30 per year for its event-based cloud service. $30 isn't a ton of money to spend, but I wish Ring could somehow include customers who either don't need or don't want to pay for six months of storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the Stick Up Cam's 80-degree field of view is pretty narrow. The competition ranges from 110 to 130 degrees, which can make a significant difference in how much of your front yard, driveway or back yard the camera is able to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Configuring the Stick Up Cam was roughly the same as setting up any other security camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Download the related Ring app on your Android or iPhone, create an account, log in and select \"Set Up Device\" on the home screen. From there, Ring will ask you what product you'd like to install, where you'd like to install it and then it will walk you through a short series of on-screen tutorials showing you how to connect the camera to your Wi-Fi network. It should take 10 minutes tops from start to finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that your camera depends on a decent Wi-Fi connection. You might find a great place to install your camera, but if your network doesn't work well in that spot, you might want to look for a new location or consider investing in a Wi-Fi range extender. You can always click on \"Device Health\" in the Ring app to view the strength of your Wi-Fi network when in doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've connected your Stick Up Cam, you can immediately view the live feed. You'll automatically get 30 days of free access to the cloud service so you can see if it's something you want to invest in later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app layout is mostly intuitive, with your camera and any related motion activity displayed on the main screen. If you click on your camera -- I labeled mine \"Backyard\" -- you get access to a lot more features. This is where you can pull up the live feed, opt-in or -out of motion alerts and set custom motion zones and schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I received the motion alerts promptly, I found the live stream to be surprisingly grainy even when the Device Health section of the app told me my Wi-Fi signal was \"Very Good.\" While that isn't a total dealbreaker, it did make 720-pixel HD look more like a 640x480 VGA SD feed. Not ideal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also had issues with two-way talk, an intercom feature that is supposed to let you communicate with someone standing near the Stick Up Cam through the Ring app on your phone. I tried this out various times and rarely was able to understand the person on the other end.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the Stick Up Cam's basic functionality, it also works with a few third-party smart home partners, including IFTTT. I created an IFTTT recipe so that I would receive a text every time the camera detected motion. This was as reliable Ring's own motion alerts, arriving quickly and consistently every time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring also sent me a solar panel accessory to use alongside the Stick Up Cam and that also worked well. You simply plug the solar panel's microUSB adapter into a port on the back of the Stick Up Cam and it will start powering your camera with the sun's energy. Ring says the Stick Up Cam's rechargeable battery can last anywhere from 6 to 12 months, too, if you'd rather go that route.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring's Stick Up Cam frustrated me because it has a lot of potential. The different power options give it a ton of versatility, but its core performance and specs don't quite stack up to outdoor cameras from Netgear and Nest. I also wish Ring offered a free cloud storage option, even if it just allowed for 24 hours of event-based clips. While this is a decent option, its relative limitations ultimately make it difficult to recommend over the competition.\n"
